# Generating quotes from Alchemy of Souls

This application returns a random quote from the Korean series *Alchemy of Souls* upon the click of a button, and displays it in the browser.

It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The *jQuery library* is used to fetch the CSV file containing the quotes/lines, which is also supported by older browsers contrary to the fetch API method. It uses the `$.get()` method to retrieve the CSV file, parse it and display the quotes. You need a *csv parser library* for this to work. This application uses `Papa Parse`. You should include the library in your HTML file before the script.

Hereâ€™s a screenshot of what the finished application looks like:
