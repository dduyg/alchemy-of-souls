1,1,"00:01:28,296","00:01:29,798",1.50,1,You poor thing.
1,1,"00:01:30,590","00:01:32,884",2.29,2,"Child, eat this."
1,1,"00:01:32,967","00:01:34,135",1.17,3,Child.
1,1,"00:01:36,721","00:01:37,806",1.08,4,Go on.
1,1,"00:01:42,185","00:01:43,728",1.54,5,I will bring you more meat.
1,1,"00:01:44,312","00:01:45,730",1.42,6,Eat slowly.
1,1,"00:02:26,312","00:02:27,313",1.00,7,Mom.
1,1,"00:03:20,199","00:03:21,284",1.08,8,Geon!
1,1,"00:03:24,954","00:03:27,832",2.88,9,I told you to reach out to me if anything were to happen to him.
1,1,"00:03:27,916","00:03:29,667",1.75,10,How could you let things come to this?
1,1,"00:03:29,751","00:03:32,295",2.54,11,He will be fine once he absorbs human energy.
1,1,"00:03:32,378","00:03:33,880",1.50,12,He returns back to normal.
1,1,"00:03:33,963","00:03:35,840",1.88,13,Your son has run wild.
1,1,"00:03:39,677","00:03:41,179",1.50,14,I shall retrieve his soul.
1,1,"00:03:42,138","00:03:43,848",1.71,15,No!
1,1,"00:03:43,932","00:03:46,392",2.46,16,You were the one who turned my son into a soul shifter.
1,1,"00:03:46,476","00:03:50,980",4.50,17,"Either get him another body, or feed him the energy of human souls!"
1,1,"00:03:51,731","00:03:53,024",1.29,18,Bring back my son.
1,1,"00:03:53,566","00:03:55,276",1.71,19,Bring back my son!
1,1,"00:03:55,944","00:04:00,615",4.67,20,"If word gets out that I used forbidden sorcery, we will both be doomed."
1,1,"00:04:01,241","00:04:02,867",1.63,21,No…
1,1,"00:04:02,951","00:04:03,785",0.83,22,Please…
1,1,"00:04:08,164","00:04:10,541",2.38,23,"No, please. Geon."
1,1,"00:04:11,417","00:04:14,045",2.63,24,Stay with me for just a bit longer.
1,1,"00:04:14,671","00:04:15,797",1.13,25,My son…
1,1,"00:05:28,286","00:05:31,831",3.55,26,Why do the bodies of soul shifters turn like rocks when they run wild?
1,1,"00:05:31,914","00:05:38,338",6.42,27,"A crack forms when the bodies clash with the souls they carry, which causes them to lose energy."
1,1,"00:05:38,921","00:05:41,591",2.67,28,This is already the eighth soul that has run wild.
1,1,"00:05:42,133","00:05:44,552",2.42,29,I guess I should stop shifting souls.
1,1,"00:05:45,178","00:05:46,971",1.79,30,You should go to the royal palace.
1,1,"00:05:48,222","00:05:53,519",5.30,31,His Majesty has been asking about the new spell that you have been trying to master.
1,1,"00:06:28,429","00:06:33,392",4.96,32,I hear… you have been trying to master a new kind of spell.
1,1,"00:06:33,893","00:06:37,563",3.67,33,It is nothing grand.
1,1,"00:06:33,893","00:06:37,563",3.67,34,It is just a trick I tried out for fun.
1,1,"00:06:38,189","00:06:41,442",3.25,35,I know I cannot ask to live for longer.
1,1,"00:06:41,526","00:06:45,947",4.42,36,"However, it saddens me that I do not have an heir."
1,1,"00:06:46,781","00:06:48,783",2.00,37,I wish you a quick recovery.
1,1,"00:06:49,575","00:06:52,078",2.50,38,I cannot do anything with this sick body.
1,1,"00:06:52,870","00:06:59,794",6.92,39,But I might have a chance if I were to live in a body that is young and healthy.
1,1,"00:07:01,754","00:07:04,715",2.96,40,There is no way for humans to switch bodies.
1,1,"00:07:08,010","00:07:10,263",2.25,41,But you can.
1,1,"00:07:14,392","00:07:15,518",1.13,42,The alchemy of souls.
1,1,"00:07:23,985","00:07:25,862",1.88,43,That is forbidden sorcery.
1,1,"00:07:25,945","00:07:29,240",3.30,44,"If a soul clashes with the body, it could even turn into an evil spirit."
1,1,"00:07:29,323","00:07:33,536",4.21,45,How could I dare move the soul of a king to another person's body?
1,1,"00:07:33,619","00:07:36,038",2.42,46,How about your body?
1,1,"00:07:39,208","00:07:41,210",2.00,47,Not for too long. Just seven days.
1,1,"00:07:41,752","00:07:43,671",1.92,48,Let us switch bodies for just seven days.
1,1,"00:07:46,841","00:07:53,347",6.51,49,I heard you once gave a soul a dead man's body and that it lived in that body for over half a year.
1,1,"00:07:54,557","00:07:58,728",4.17,50,"I am a king protected by the skies, and you are the best mage in this land."
1,1,"00:07:58,811","00:08:00,313",1.50,51,So what is there to worry about?
1,1,"00:08:01,522","00:08:04,901",3.38,52,"And after seven days, you can turn things back."
1,1,"00:08:08,196","00:08:12,742",4.55,53,You have mastered the ability to do something that only the best mages can do.
1,1,"00:08:14,035","00:08:17,914",3.88,54,Yet you are just wasting your time shifting souls into dead bodies.
1,1,"00:08:22,835","00:08:23,961",1.13,55,Jang Gang.
1,1,"00:08:24,670","00:08:26,380",1.71,56,Give this king a different body.
1,1,"00:11:07,291","00:11:09,877",2.59,57,His Majesty and I have switched bodies.
1,1,"00:11:18,594","00:11:20,846",2.25,58,I shall make Do-hwa mine.
1,1,"00:11:20,930","00:11:23,432",2.50,59,"If she bears a child, know that it is mine."
1,1,"00:11:25,935","00:11:27,186",1.25,60,Do-hwa.
1,1,"00:11:31,607","00:11:32,733",1.13,61,Do-hwa.
1,1,"00:11:34,068","00:11:35,694",1.63,62,You are very beautiful.
1,1,"00:11:46,831","00:11:49,375",2.54,63,"No, that cannot happen."
1,1,"00:11:53,921","00:11:56,757",2.84,64,That cannot happen.
1,1,"00:11:57,425","00:11:58,634",1.21,65,No!
1,1,"00:12:20,948","00:12:24,034",3.09,66,"The energy of the sky rules the wind, clouds, and rain."
1,1,"00:12:24,535","00:12:29,957",5.42,67,This energy reached the ground and created a huge form of energy.
1,1,"00:12:30,040","00:12:32,418",2.38,68,A country was built around
1,1,"00:12:30,040","00:12:34,462",4.42,69,"Lake Gyeongcheondaeho, a lake that embodied that energy."
1,1,"00:12:34,545","00:12:38,174",3.63,70,"The name of the country was Daeho, due to the enormous lake it had."
1,1,"00:12:40,259","00:12:45,264",5.00,71,Humans who had the power to control this great energy were called mages.
1,1,"00:12:47,224","00:12:52,396",5.17,72,"This story is about the mages of Daeho, a place that does not exist in both history books or maps."
1,1,"00:13:08,287","00:13:12,041",3.75,73,20 YEARS LATER
1,1,"00:13:21,467","00:13:27,014",5.55,74,"So you are Naksu, the Shadow Assassin who has been going around killing the mages in the city."
1,1,"00:13:27,097","00:13:32,311",5.21,75,"They call me Naksu, for wherever I go, heads fall to the ground."
1,1,"00:13:33,062","00:13:34,772",1.71,76,"A beautiful name, is it not?"
1,1,"00:13:35,981","00:13:37,024",1.04,77,Kill her.
1,1,"00:13:39,485","00:13:40,361",0.88,78,Shoot!
1,1,"00:16:38,664","00:16:40,124",1.46,79,Do not let her get away.
1,1,"00:16:40,791","00:16:42,292",1.50,80,Capture her.
1,1,"00:16:40,791","00:16:42,292",1.50,81,"Yes, my lord!"
1,1,"00:16:55,180","00:16:56,890",1.71,82,Let us go that way. Follow me.
1,1,"00:17:07,443","00:17:08,694",1.25,83,Over there!
1,1,"00:17:58,786","00:18:00,162",1.38,84,I will not die like this.
1,1,"00:18:00,996","00:18:02,206",1.21,85,I cannot.
1,1,"00:18:11,048","00:18:15,135",4.09,86,"Goodness, you are so impatient."
1,1,"00:18:11,048","00:18:15,135",4.09,87,I am coming.
1,1,"00:18:31,235","00:18:32,486",1.25,88,What do you want?
1,1,"00:18:35,572","00:18:37,741",2.17,89,"Oh, my goodness!"
1,1,"00:19:02,432","00:19:03,725",1.29,90,TAVERN
1,1,"00:19:11,316","00:19:12,484",1.17,91,She is dead.
1,1,"00:19:33,839","00:19:35,549",1.71,92,She does not have the blue mark.
1,1,"00:19:39,344","00:19:41,930",2.59,93,This blue mark proves that her soul has left this body.
1,1,"00:19:43,348","00:19:47,352",4.00,94,Does that mean she failed to enter another body?
1,1,"00:20:16,256","00:20:21,094",4.84,95,SONGRIM
1,1,"00:20:24,556","00:20:25,474",0.92,96,One.
1,1,"00:20:27,893","00:20:28,727",0.83,97,Two.
1,1,"00:20:30,520","00:20:31,563",1.04,98,Three.
1,1,"00:20:50,916","00:20:53,460",2.54,99,"Yul, come here."
1,1,"00:20:57,673","00:20:59,216",1.54,100,Is she Naksu?
1,1,"00:21:00,050","00:21:01,009",0.96,101,Yes.
1,1,"00:21:02,427","00:21:05,555",3.13,102,This mark shows that her soul has left the body.
1,1,"00:21:06,139","00:21:09,017",2.88,103,Remember this mark.
1,1,"00:21:06,139","00:21:12,813",6.67,104,"When someone tries to switch bodies, it leaves a blue bruise like this right on top of their heart."
1,1,"00:21:13,939","00:21:16,817",2.88,105,Does that mean her soul escaped her body?
1,1,"00:21:16,900","00:21:20,404",3.50,106,"She seems to have tried, but I think she failed."
1,1,"00:21:21,154","00:21:27,286",6.13,107,"This proves that her soul has escaped her body, but we found no signs of her soul having entered another body."
1,1,"00:21:37,421","00:21:39,798",2.38,108,It is a whistle.
1,1,"00:21:37,421","00:21:39,798",2.38,109,A whistle?
1,1,"00:21:39,881","00:21:42,759",2.88,110,I once had a similar one myself back when I had a pet bird.
1,1,"00:21:44,720","00:21:47,139",2.42,111,Did she have a pet bird?
1,1,"00:21:47,222","00:21:49,224",2.00,112,I think she had it for quite a while.
1,1,"00:21:50,017","00:21:51,810",1.79,113,It looks like it is an important item.
1,1,"00:21:52,644","00:22:00,235",7.59,114,"She may have been an assassin who killed people like it was nothing, but she was still human."
1,1,"00:21:55,856","00:22:00,235",4.38,115,She must have had a story of her own.
1,1,"00:22:08,160","00:22:10,746",2.59,116,A lot of people have already seen Naksu's body.
1,1,"00:22:10,829","00:22:13,040",2.21,117,Word will spread about the alchemy of souls.
1,1,"00:22:13,707","00:22:16,710",3.00,118,Has it been 20 years since we have seen a soul shifter?
1,1,"00:22:17,252","00:22:18,253",1.00,119,Yes.
1,1,"00:22:19,338","00:22:22,758",3.42,120,The last soul shifter ran wild and ended up killing many people.
1,1,"00:22:23,759","00:22:27,095",3.34,121,I am worried that might happen again.
1,1,"00:22:27,679","00:22:30,057",2.38,122,Uncle!
1,1,"00:22:31,892","00:22:34,644",2.75,123,"Uncle, I heard Naksu was a soul shifter."
1,1,"00:22:35,228","00:22:37,147",1.92,124,"Master Heo, did you see her too?"
1,1,"00:22:37,230","00:22:40,692",3.46,125,You seem awfully excited to start rumors.
1,1,"00:22:40,776","00:22:43,445",2.67,126,Rumors have already spread.
1,1,"00:22:40,776","00:22:43,445",2.67,127,I came as soon as I heard.
1,1,"00:22:44,071","00:22:45,906",1.84,128,Where did you hear it?
1,1,"00:22:44,071","00:22:45,906",1.84,129,At Chwiseonru.
1,1,"00:22:45,989","00:22:47,699",1.71,130,You are a mage of Jeongjingak.
1,1,"00:22:47,783","00:22:51,578",3.80,131,"But instead of practicing, you go to bars and listen to rumors."
1,1,"00:22:53,121","00:22:59,586",6.46,132,"Songrim Jeongjingak is not only a place for mages to practice their spells, but also a place to gather information."
1,1,"00:23:00,629","00:23:07,427",6.80,133,"Also, Dang-gu here will follow in your footsteps and become the leader of the Songrim household."
1,1,"00:23:07,511","00:23:09,346",1.84,134,He should know his liquor.
1,1,"00:23:09,429","00:23:10,472",1.04,135,"Now, tell me."
1,1,"00:23:11,181","00:23:13,475",2.29,136,Which liquor tastes best at Chwiseonru?
1,1,"00:23:14,434","00:23:17,395",2.96,137,I do not go there as often anymore now that Uk is not here.
1,1,"00:23:17,479","00:23:19,481",2.00,138,"""Uk""? The son of Jang Gang?"
1,1,"00:23:19,564","00:23:23,944",4.38,139,Is he not learning how to write at the village school in Yeongchundang?
1,1,"00:23:24,027","00:23:26,113",2.09,140,He got kicked out of there ages ago.
1,1,"00:23:26,196","00:23:28,115",1.92,141,"Right now, he is in Gisan."
1,1,"00:23:28,198","00:23:31,910",3.71,142,I sent him to receive training from Buddhist Monk Ho-yeong.
1,1,"00:23:33,370","00:23:37,082",3.71,143,Uk went to train at a Buddhist temple this time?
1,1,"00:23:38,708","00:23:41,545",2.84,144,"Today, I shall end my training."
1,1,"00:23:43,046","00:23:45,715",2.67,145,You have not even finished your training.
1,1,"00:23:45,799","00:23:48,927",3.13,146,How dare you decide to end the training without my permission.
1,1,"00:23:49,010","00:23:53,306",4.30,147,"You asked me to expand my knowledge, so I read and memorized hundreds of spell books."
1,1,"00:23:53,390","00:23:57,769",4.38,148,"You asked me to train my mind, so I patiently sharpened hundreds of swords."
1,1,"00:23:57,853","00:24:01,773",3.92,149,"However, you never taught me any kind of spell."
1,1,"00:24:02,399","00:24:09,322",6.92,150,The only lesson I learned here is that you have no intentions of teaching me spells at all.
1,1,"00:24:09,906","00:24:14,119",4.21,151,"Now that I have learned a big lesson, I would like to end it and leave."
1,1,"00:24:14,619","00:24:17,831",3.21,152,The leader of Songrim asked me to keep you here for three years.
1,1,"00:24:17,914","00:24:21,209",3.30,153,I know you are building a sanctuary with the money I paid you in advance.
1,1,"00:24:21,293","00:24:24,171",2.88,154,"I will not ask for a refund, so I hope it is successfully built."
1,1,"00:24:26,298","00:24:29,301",3.00,155,Where do you think you are going?
1,1,"00:24:26,298","00:24:29,301",3.00,156,I never said you could leave!
1,1,"00:24:31,178","00:24:34,598",3.42,157,Did it sound like I was asking for your permission?
1,1,"00:24:37,184","00:24:41,021",3.84,158,You were conceived through your mother's affair and were abandoned by your father.
1,1,"00:24:41,104","00:24:43,607",2.50,159,So what would you know about respecting your master?
1,1,"00:24:43,690","00:24:46,443",2.75,160,I refuse to teach a guy like you.
1,1,"00:24:47,485","00:24:51,364",3.88,161,"I may not know much about respecting a master, but I do know how to be a creditor."
1,1,"00:24:51,448","00:24:55,327",3.88,162,"Say one more word, and you will not be able to build that sanctuary."
1,1,"00:24:56,953","00:24:58,747",1.79,163,Because I will be getting a refund.
1,1,"00:24:59,456","00:25:04,211",4.76,164,No one in this world will teach you spells because of your father.
1,1,"00:25:04,294","00:25:06,838",2.54,165,"Goodness, thank you for your concern."
1,1,"00:25:07,881","00:25:11,384",3.50,166,I will find my own master.
1,1,"00:25:12,135","00:25:15,263",3.13,167,Someone extremely powerful and skilled.
1,1,"00:25:32,530","00:25:34,199",1.67,168,"Mu-deok, are you all right?"
1,1,"00:26:35,093","00:26:38,013",2.92,169,Why did I have to enter a body like this one?
1,1,"00:26:41,016","00:26:43,226",2.21,170,I am sure she was blind.
1,1,"00:26:48,356","00:26:50,150",1.79,171,But why is it that I see?
1,1,"00:26:50,817","00:26:52,527",1.71,172,Is it because I am a different soul?
1,1,"00:26:55,322","00:26:58,116",2.79,173,She did not even have a blue mark showing I entered her body.
1,1,"00:26:58,199","00:26:59,617",1.42,174,How unusual.
1,1,"00:27:00,702","00:27:03,747",3.05,175,Try to bear with the motion sickness.
1,1,"00:27:00,702","00:27:03,747",3.05,176,"We are almost there, Mu-deok."
1,1,"00:27:06,291","00:27:07,250",0.96,177,"""Mu-deok."""
1,1,"00:27:07,334","00:27:10,837",3.50,178,She is a blind girl from the countryside who got sold off to the fortress.
1,1,"00:27:14,382","00:27:15,759",1.38,179,Sit down. You will fall.
1,1,"00:27:26,728","00:27:28,188",1.46,180,Thanks for the journey.
1,1,"00:27:29,064","00:27:30,065",1.00,181,I will be off now.
1,1,"00:27:42,494","00:27:43,787",1.29,182,What is wrong with me?
1,1,"00:27:44,329","00:27:45,705",1.38,183,I have no strength.
1,1,"00:27:46,456","00:27:48,875",2.42,184,Is this body not capable of even climbing this?
1,1,"00:27:50,960","00:27:52,128",1.17,185,My arms feel weak.
1,1,"00:27:53,046","00:27:54,297",1.25,186,Mister!
1,1,"00:27:54,881","00:27:56,508",1.63,187,Help me!
1,1,"00:27:54,881","00:27:56,508",1.63,188,What…
1,1,"00:27:56,591","00:27:58,343",1.75,189,Mister!
1,1,"00:27:56,591","00:27:58,343",1.75,190,"Oh, dear!"
1,1,"00:27:58,426","00:27:59,761",1.34,191,"Mu-deok, hold on!"
1,1,"00:27:59,844","00:28:00,720",0.88,192,Mister!
1,1,"00:28:00,804","00:28:03,473",2.67,193,Turn the boat around! Go back!
1,1,"00:28:03,556","00:28:05,141",1.59,194,My goodness.
1,1,"00:28:03,556","00:28:05,141",1.59,195,"Oh, dear! Mu-deok!"
1,1,"00:28:05,225","00:28:06,309",1.08,196,I will fall.
1,1,"00:28:06,393","00:28:07,435",1.04,197,Mister!
1,1,"00:28:19,322","00:28:23,410",4.09,198,Why were you hanging from there when you cannot even see?
1,1,"00:28:23,493","00:28:24,828",1.34,199,You could have gotten hurt.
1,1,"00:28:26,663","00:28:28,123",1.46,200,This is really bad.
1,1,"00:28:28,206","00:28:30,041",1.84,201,My strength is gone.
1,1,"00:28:35,547","00:28:37,006",1.46,202,Is it motion sickness again?
1,1,"00:28:37,674","00:28:40,885",3.21,203,I am so worried about how weak you are.
1,1,"00:28:41,469","00:28:42,929",1.46,204,Weak.
1,1,"00:28:43,012","00:28:45,390",2.38,205,This body is unbelievably unhealthy and weak.
1,1,"00:28:46,099","00:28:49,227",3.13,206,I should not switch bodies too soon.
1,1,"00:28:46,099","00:28:49,227",3.13,207,Let us stay as Mu-deok for now.
1,1,"00:28:49,853","00:28:52,147",2.29,208,"I am sorry, Mister."
1,1,"00:28:52,230","00:28:53,481",1.25,209,It is fine.
1,1,"00:28:53,565","00:28:55,233",1.67,210,It is all because your body is weak.
1,1,"00:28:55,984","00:28:57,152",1.17,211,Let us fill ourselves up.
1,1,"00:29:09,998","00:29:10,832",0.83,212,Enjoy.
1,1,"00:29:09,998","00:29:10,832",0.83,213,Thank you.
1,1,"00:29:10,915","00:29:12,667",1.75,214,"Today, let us eat good food."
1,1,"00:29:12,751","00:29:14,127",1.38,215,It is chicken. Enjoy.
1,1,"00:29:15,462","00:29:17,964",2.50,216,"As an assassin, I am sensitive to the smell of blood."
1,1,"00:29:18,047","00:29:21,926",3.88,217,"Thus, I do not eat animals that shed the same colored blood as humans."
1,1,"00:29:22,010","00:29:23,678",1.67,218,I will pass.
1,1,"00:29:22,010","00:29:23,678",1.67,219,Just eat.
1,1,"00:29:31,644","00:29:34,272",2.63,220,It is my first time eating meat.
1,1,"00:29:35,607","00:29:36,775",1.17,221,It is delicious.
1,1,"00:29:41,529","00:29:42,614",1.09,222,Eat up.
1,1,"00:29:42,697","00:29:49,204",6.51,223,"I really did not want to send you there, but it was the only place that agreed to take a blind person."
1,1,"00:29:51,623","00:29:54,751",3.13,224,"""There""? Where are you talking about?"
1,1,"00:29:57,545","00:30:00,673",3.13,225,An old woman took her in after she lost both her parents.
1,1,"00:30:00,757","00:30:02,926",2.17,226,But she got sick and recently passed away.
1,1,"00:30:03,009","00:30:07,472",4.46,227,"The debt she had due to her illness got passed onto her, which is why she's here to be sold off."
1,1,"00:30:07,555","00:30:08,515",0.96,228,I will be off now.
1,1,"00:30:09,516","00:30:11,768",2.25,229,You cannot sell this poor soul to a brothel.
1,1,"00:30:11,851","00:30:14,229",2.38,230,I wish you well.
1,1,"00:30:11,851","00:30:19,359",7.51,231,But… I cannot believe he fed me chicken just to sell me to this place.
1,1,"00:30:19,442","00:30:22,570",3.13,232,I will rip you to pieces as soon as I regain my power.
1,1,"00:30:23,071","00:30:25,156",2.09,233,You are way too skinny.
1,1,"00:30:25,240","00:30:28,076",2.84,234,I wonder if you will become prettier if you become chubbier.
1,1,"00:30:28,159","00:30:30,578",2.42,235,Just give up.
1,1,"00:30:28,159","00:30:30,578",2.42,236,Getting chubby will not make me prettier.
1,1,"00:30:31,162","00:30:33,748",2.59,237,I am useless and not suitable to work at a brothel.
1,1,"00:30:33,832","00:30:35,208",1.38,238,Sell me off to someplace else.
1,1,"00:30:35,291","00:30:37,418",2.13,239,You talk very eloquently.
1,1,"00:30:38,002","00:30:39,170",1.17,240,I heard you sing well.
1,1,"00:30:39,254","00:30:41,631",2.38,241,I hope you sing as well as you talk.
1,1,"00:30:44,384","00:30:47,262",2.88,242,You should wash first.
1,1,"00:30:44,384","00:30:47,262",2.88,243,And doll yourself up.
1,1,"00:31:01,609","00:31:03,361",1.75,244,You even know how to dance?
1,1,"00:31:03,945","00:31:05,071",1.13,245,Did it look like a dance?
1,1,"00:31:05,989","00:31:09,158",3.17,246,"If my moves contained power, your arm would have fallen right off."
1,1,"00:31:12,370","00:31:15,039",2.67,247,"I am older than you, so you should speak in honorifics."
1,1,"00:31:15,123","00:31:17,458",2.34,248,You better treat our customers with respect too.
1,1,"00:31:17,542","00:31:19,919",2.38,249,You just wait. I will kill you too.
1,1,"00:31:21,170","00:31:25,008",3.84,250,A lot of powerful people come to our brothel.
1,1,"00:31:25,592","00:31:28,761",3.17,251,The Four Seasons of Daeho are also regulars of Chwiseonru.
1,1,"00:31:29,929","00:31:31,055",1.13,252,The four what?
1,1,"00:31:31,139","00:31:34,434",3.30,253,There are four different types of beautiful people in Daeho Fortress.
1,1,"00:31:34,517","00:31:36,603",2.09,254,And they are called the Four Seasons.
1,1,"00:31:51,367","00:31:54,662",3.30,255,The daughter of the Jin family who has the vitality of spring.
1,1,"00:31:55,496","00:31:56,414",0.92,256,Jin Cho-yeon.
1,1,"00:32:11,930","00:32:14,807",2.88,257,The heir of the Park family who has the energy of a hot summer.
1,1,"00:32:14,891","00:32:16,142",1.25,258,Park Dang-gu.
1,1,"00:32:27,946","00:32:31,282",3.34,259,The genius of the Seo family who is as noble as the sunset in fall.
1,1,"00:32:32,116","00:32:33,117",1.00,260,Seo Yul.
1,1,"00:32:51,052","00:32:58,685",7.63,261,"Then there is Jang Uk, the successor of the Jang family who is as dazzling as the winter snow."
1,1,"00:33:06,401","00:33:09,153",2.75,262,"The Jin, Park, Seo, and Jang family."
1,1,"00:33:09,237","00:33:12,240",3.00,263,They are the most well-known mage families in Daeho.
1,1,"00:33:12,323","00:33:14,325",2.00,264,Their children are known as the Four Seasons.
1,1,"00:33:15,451","00:33:18,079",2.63,265,Is that what they are called in the fortress?
1,1,"00:33:20,289","00:33:23,251",2.96,266,There is my summer prince.
1,1,"00:33:28,131","00:33:32,593",4.46,267,"If he is the heir of the Park family, he must be Park Jin's nephew."
1,1,"00:33:35,221","00:33:36,139",0.92,268,Park Jin.
1,1,"00:33:39,684","00:33:42,145",2.46,269,He was there that night too.
1,1,"00:33:51,654","00:33:52,697",1.04,270,Jin.
1,1,"00:33:53,656","00:33:54,782",1.13,271,Seo.
1,1,"00:33:55,491","00:33:56,701",1.21,272,Jang.
1,1,"00:33:57,410","00:33:58,619",1.21,273,Park.
1,1,"00:34:07,962","00:34:08,963",1.00,274,The Four Seasons?
1,1,"00:34:10,423","00:34:14,218",3.80,275,"Once I come across all four of you, it will be the end of it."
1,1,"00:34:17,221","00:34:19,724",2.50,276,May you greet your deaths as beautifully as your names.
1,1,"00:34:23,811","00:34:26,481",2.67,277,Who are you here to meet today?
1,1,"00:34:26,564","00:34:30,401",3.84,278,My uncle told me to come and fetch someone.
1,1,"00:34:30,985","00:34:33,154",2.17,279,Fetch someone? Who?
1,1,"00:34:33,237","00:34:38,868",5.63,280,A trainee in Gisan humiliated his master and got sent away.
1,1,"00:34:39,994","00:34:42,497",2.50,281,I bet this is where he is hiding.
1,1,"00:34:43,372","00:34:44,999",1.63,282,Will you look at that?
1,1,"00:34:45,083","00:34:50,421",5.34,283,He must have craved seafood because he was stuck in the mountains for so long.
1,1,"00:34:50,505","00:34:52,381",1.88,284,I guess he is in that room.
1,1,"00:35:12,151","00:35:13,236",1.09,285,Goodness.
1,1,"00:35:14,403","00:35:19,742",5.34,286,"Thanks to you, my uncle has to go all the way to Gisan to beg for the monk's forgiveness."
1,1,"00:35:19,826","00:35:24,580",4.75,287,"Meanwhile, you are here enjoying this damn crab."
1,1,"00:35:24,664","00:35:26,332",1.67,288,"No, I have not eaten it."
1,1,"00:35:26,415","00:35:27,750",1.34,289,It is such a hassle to eat.
1,1,"00:35:28,334","00:35:30,670",2.34,290,I am glad you came.
1,1,"00:35:28,334","00:35:30,670",2.34,291,Break the shell with your spell.
1,1,"00:35:31,671","00:35:32,922",1.25,292,Unbelievable.
1,1,"00:35:33,005","00:35:36,968",3.96,293,I do know how to crack the shell and pick out just the meat.
1,1,"00:35:37,051","00:35:39,720",2.67,294,"But maybe I should use that spell on you, not the crab."
1,1,"00:35:39,804","00:35:45,309",5.51,295,"Dang-gu, if that monk had been kind enough to at least teach me that, I would not have left that way."
1,1,"00:35:45,393","00:35:47,061",1.67,296,What good is it if you cannot do it?
1,1,"00:35:47,145","00:35:49,063",1.92,297,Your dad blocked you from casting spells.
1,1,"00:35:49,147","00:35:50,731",1.58,298,Then he should have helped me break that.
1,1,"00:35:50,815","00:35:54,318",3.50,299,That is what masters do.
1,1,"00:35:50,815","00:35:54,318",3.50,300,They help their students.
1,1,"00:35:54,402","00:35:59,323",4.92,301,No one in Daeho is brave enough to go against your dad like that.
1,1,"00:35:59,407","00:36:00,992",1.59,302,But some live fearlessly.
1,1,"00:36:01,075","00:36:05,163",4.09,303,"For example, the Shadow Assassin, Naksu."
1,1,"00:36:09,542","00:36:10,668",1.13,304,Do not be ridiculous.
1,1,"00:36:10,751","00:36:14,005",3.25,305,I heard she is so skilled that even the leader cannot beat her.
1,1,"00:36:15,298","00:36:16,632",1.33,306,She is dead.
1,1,"00:36:17,300","00:36:20,136",2.84,307,"Her soul left her body, so that means she might still be alive."
1,1,"00:36:21,637","00:36:22,930",1.29,308,Who told you that?
1,1,"00:36:23,639","00:36:26,225",2.59,309,Do you think I am here just so I can eat crab?
1,1,"00:36:26,309","00:36:29,812",3.50,310,This is the fastest place to hear everything that goes on in Daeho.
1,1,"00:36:30,354","00:36:31,772",1.42,311,Pick out the meat already.
1,1,"00:36:31,856","00:36:34,650",2.79,312,Put those spells to good use and pick out the crab meat.
1,1,"00:36:34,734","00:36:37,987",3.25,313,"Why can you not pick out the meat yourself, you lazybones?"
1,1,"00:36:41,490","00:36:43,993",2.50,314,You look pretty now that you have washed.
1,1,"00:36:44,076","00:36:45,244",1.17,315,Let me put makeup on you.
1,1,"00:36:46,454","00:36:48,956",2.50,316,"Ju-wol, I will just do it myself."
1,1,"00:36:49,040","00:36:51,751",2.71,317,But how? You cannot even see.
1,1,"00:36:53,044","00:36:57,131",4.09,318,"I have never done this in my life, so I need to prepare myself."
1,1,"00:36:58,591","00:37:00,676",2.09,319,I would like to be alone for a while.
1,1,"00:37:02,637","00:37:04,889",2.25,320,Sure. Come out when you are ready.
1,1,"00:37:16,025","00:37:18,277",2.25,321,Being blind makes it easier to fool people.
1,1,"00:37:19,445","00:37:21,072",1.63,322,I need money to run away.
1,1,"00:37:23,616","00:37:25,076",1.46,323,Are these made of real gold?
1,1,"00:37:26,619","00:37:28,120",1.50,324,This is jade.
1,1,"00:37:28,955","00:37:32,041",3.09,325,"Mu-deok, try applying this new rouge."
1,1,"00:37:33,668","00:37:34,543",0.88,326,What are you doing?
1,1,"00:37:36,087","00:37:38,422",2.34,327,"Ju-wol, what is wrong?"
1,1,"00:37:41,300","00:37:42,969",1.67,328,Can you see?
1,1,"00:37:52,436","00:37:54,855",2.42,329,Catch Mu-deok! Catch the thief!
1,1,"00:38:00,653","00:38:01,946",1.29,330,It is too high.
1,1,"00:38:10,329","00:38:11,205",0.88,331,That way!
1,1,"00:38:34,979","00:38:36,439",1.46,332,What are you looking at?
1,1,"00:38:54,248","00:38:55,374",1.13,333,You…
1,1,"00:39:03,299","00:39:04,675",1.38,334,Do not make a sound.
1,1,"00:39:06,510","00:39:09,388",2.88,335,I heard a blind girl recently joined the place.
1,1,"00:39:10,014","00:39:11,057",1.04,336,But you can see.
1,1,"00:39:14,060","00:39:15,811",1.75,337,They told me your name.
1,1,"00:39:15,895","00:39:17,938",2.04,338,"I think it started with a ""D"" or something."
1,1,"00:39:18,022","00:39:19,106",1.08,339,No.
1,1,"00:39:20,441","00:39:21,650",1.21,340,"Oh, I remember."
1,1,"00:39:22,568","00:39:23,444",0.88,341,Mu-deok.
1,1,"00:39:25,237","00:39:27,531",2.29,342,"Yes, I am Mu-deok."
1,1,"00:39:28,407","00:39:35,373",6.97,343,"I know what you look like, so if you do not stay quiet until I leave, I will come back and behead you."
1,1,"00:39:39,293","00:39:40,336",1.04,344,What is so funny?
1,1,"00:39:42,338","00:39:43,672",1.33,345,You have beautiful eyes.
1,1,"00:39:46,509","00:39:47,510",1.00,346,Cut the nonsense.
1,1,"00:39:48,636","00:39:51,639",3.00,347,"Right, sorry."
1,1,"00:39:48,636","00:39:51,639",3.00,348,Only your eyes are beautiful.
1,1,"00:39:53,599","00:39:54,725",1.13,349,You must be crazy.
1,1,"00:40:01,690","00:40:02,525",0.84,350,Mu-deok.
1,1,"00:40:03,234","00:40:04,527",1.29,351,Mu-deok!
1,1,"00:40:06,153","00:40:08,739",2.59,352,Come on. There is not much in there.
1,1,"00:40:10,699","00:40:13,869",3.17,353,Just… take this instead.
1,1,"00:40:17,289","00:40:18,374",1.08,354,Hey…
1,1,"00:40:37,476","00:40:40,312",2.84,355,What are you looking at?
1,1,"00:40:37,476","00:40:40,312",2.84,356,What? Nothing.
1,1,"00:40:45,693","00:40:46,652",0.96,357,Dang-gu.
1,1,"00:40:48,237","00:40:51,115",2.88,358,"I heard Naksu, the Shadow Assassin, uses Tansu."
1,1,"00:40:51,198","00:40:53,117",1.92,359,What do you know about Tansu?
1,1,"00:40:53,200","00:40:55,703",2.50,360,I know enough.
1,1,"00:40:53,200","00:40:55,703",2.50,361,I read about it in my free time.
1,1,"00:40:56,203","00:40:57,121",0.92,362,TANSU
1,1,"00:40:57,830","00:41:02,960",5.13,363,"You see, Tansu is a type of swordsmanship that only the best mages can learn."
1,1,"00:41:03,043","00:41:05,838",2.80,364,You flick energy with a blade just like how you flick water.
1,1,"00:41:05,921","00:41:08,382",2.46,365,A single strike is enough to kill someone.
1,1,"00:41:18,142","00:41:20,478",2.34,366,But why do you ask?
1,1,"00:41:21,145","00:41:24,607",3.46,367,I am just wondering if this crab leg almost could have killed me.
1,1,"00:41:24,690","00:41:27,526",2.84,368,Give it here. Give it to me.
1,1,"00:41:24,690","00:41:27,526",2.84,369,I will pick out the meat--
1,1,"00:41:29,069","00:41:32,198",3.13,370,"Listen, Uk."
1,1,"00:41:29,069","00:41:32,198",3.13,371,You are aiming at a vital point.
1,1,"00:41:33,782","00:41:35,034",1.25,372,I could die.
1,1,"00:41:35,117","00:41:37,286",2.17,373,"Yes, she aimed at my vital point in just one go."
1,1,"00:41:40,414","00:41:43,417",3.00,374,But why did she roll off then?
1,1,"00:41:49,048","00:41:52,426",3.38,375,Why is it that this tiny body keeps craving food?
1,1,"00:41:52,510","00:41:54,762",2.25,376,"If I do not eat, I only become weaker."
1,1,"00:41:55,304","00:41:56,639",1.34,377,I have no other choice.
1,1,"00:42:07,316","00:42:09,610",2.29,378,Now is not the time to fight.
1,1,"00:42:07,316","00:42:09,610",2.29,379,I should hold it in.
1,1,"00:42:15,366","00:42:16,992",1.63,380,The mages of Jeongjingak are here.
1,1,"00:42:22,414","00:42:24,750",2.34,381,I heard an assassin has entered Songrim Jeongjingak.
1,1,"00:42:24,833","00:42:26,919",2.09,382,What fool would break into Jeongjingak?
1,1,"00:42:27,002","00:42:29,213",2.21,383,"She aimed for the leader, but got caught."
1,1,"00:42:29,296","00:42:30,756",1.46,384,The assassin is a young lady.
1,1,"00:42:30,839","00:42:32,299",1.46,385,My goodness gracious.
1,1,"00:43:04,039","00:43:06,458",2.42,386,He would have seen my dead body.
1,1,"00:43:06,542","00:43:08,002",1.46,387,He likely did not recognize me.
1,1,"00:43:09,128","00:43:12,756",3.63,388,I am sure he did not recognize the whistle either.
1,1,"00:43:22,141","00:43:24,852",2.71,389,There are no signs of Naksu having visited this place.
1,1,"00:43:25,561","00:43:28,355",2.79,390,I think she failed to find a new body.
1,1,"00:43:29,440","00:43:34,570",5.13,391,"Even if she succeeded, she probably is not showing herself because she is facing a problem."
1,1,"00:43:34,653","00:43:37,448",2.80,392,An assassin with a revealed identity must be discarded.
1,1,"00:43:39,908","00:43:41,869",1.96,393,We will have to retrieve her body and sword.
1,1,"00:43:41,952","00:43:44,204",2.25,394,Get rid of all everything that has to do with her.
1,1,"00:43:44,288","00:43:48,250",3.96,395,What happens if she is still alive?
1,1,"00:43:49,835","00:43:56,258",6.42,396,"She will either get killed for being a soul shifter, or her soul will clash with her new body, and she will turn into a rock."
1,1,"00:43:56,842","00:43:59,303",2.46,397,I trained her to become the best assassin.
1,1,"00:44:00,179","00:44:01,430",1.25,398,It is a pity.
1,1,"00:44:09,813","00:44:11,398",1.59,399,How much longer do you need?
1,1,"00:44:11,482","00:44:15,444",3.96,400,"It is expensive, so I need to take a closer look."
1,1,"00:44:15,527","00:44:18,822",3.30,401,I will not ask for too much.
1,1,"00:44:15,527","00:44:18,822",3.30,402,Just pick a price and pay me.
1,1,"00:44:21,200","00:44:22,076",0.88,403,Over here!
1,1,"00:44:22,993","00:44:24,578",1.59,404,It is her.
1,1,"00:44:22,993","00:44:24,578",1.59,405,What is going on?
1,1,"00:44:24,662","00:44:25,788",1.13,406,Take her away!
1,1,"00:44:41,428","00:44:43,931",2.50,407,Where am I? Did I get caught?
1,1,"00:44:45,140","00:44:46,684",1.54,408,Then is this Songrim?
1,1,"00:44:49,895","00:44:51,271",1.38,409,Are you awake?
1,1,"00:44:51,355","00:44:53,691",2.34,410,Who are you? Where is this place?
1,1,"00:44:57,736","00:45:00,656",2.92,411,"It is the house of Master Jang Gang, the head of Cheonbugwan."
1,1,"00:45:01,240","00:45:04,410",3.17,412,"""Jang Gang""?"
1,1,"00:45:01,240","00:45:04,410",3.17,413,So this is the Jang family's house?
1,1,"00:45:08,831","00:45:13,293",4.46,414,I wonder why Young Master brought home such a weak girl.
1,1,"00:45:13,377","00:45:15,879",2.50,415,"""Young Master""?"
1,1,"00:45:13,377","00:45:15,879",2.50,416,That is right.
1,1,"00:45:15,963","00:45:19,758",3.79,417,Young Master Jang Uk paid money to bring you here from the brothel.
1,1,"00:45:19,842","00:45:23,387",3.55,418,I heard you stole his Jade Plaque at the brothel.
1,1,"00:45:25,389","00:45:26,682",1.29,419,Take this instead.
1,1,"00:45:28,725","00:45:29,935",1.21,420,Hey…
1,1,"00:45:30,853","00:45:32,604",1.75,421,Why would he bring me here?
1,1,"00:45:32,688","00:45:38,026",5.34,422,"I was worried when he said he was going to bring home a girl, but you put me at ease."
1,1,"00:45:38,110","00:45:39,778",1.67,423,He only helped out of pity.
1,1,"00:45:40,571","00:45:42,865",2.29,424,Here. Get changed.
1,1,"00:45:42,948","00:45:44,158",1.21,425,Mu-deok.
1,1,"00:45:44,241","00:45:46,243",2.00,426,What is this?
1,1,"00:45:44,241","00:45:46,243",2.00,427,What do you think?
1,1,"00:45:46,326","00:45:48,120",1.79,428,It is your uniform as a servant.
1,1,"00:45:48,203","00:45:52,249",4.05,429,"Also, you need to speak to me using honorifics."
1,1,"00:45:53,834","00:45:57,379",3.55,430,"Young Master Jang is weak, so he gets tired very easily."
1,1,"00:45:57,463","00:45:59,715",2.25,431,Make sure you do things as soon as you are asked.
1,1,"00:46:00,299","00:46:03,927",3.63,432,And always put on a smile no matter what he says.
1,1,"00:46:05,137","00:46:06,221",1.08,433,Where is my answer?
1,1,"00:46:07,389","00:46:09,475",2.09,434,"Yes, ma'am."
1,1,"00:46:07,389","00:46:09,475",2.09,435,Good.
1,1,"00:46:10,058","00:46:13,479",3.42,436,"He wanted to see you as soon as possible, so get changed and go see him."
1,1,"00:46:13,562","00:46:14,646",1.08,437,Answer me.
1,1,"00:46:15,355","00:46:16,482",1.13,438,Yes…
1,1,"00:46:17,649","00:46:18,484",0.84,439,Miss.
1,1,"00:46:20,194","00:46:22,070",1.88,440,"I would rather you call me ""ma'am."""
1,1,"00:46:26,408","00:46:27,576",1.17,441,"""Young Master""?"
1,1,"00:46:28,785","00:46:30,454",1.67,442,Why would he bring me home?
1,1,"00:46:33,665","00:46:35,042",1.38,443,You have beautiful eyes.
1,1,"00:46:36,126","00:46:37,503",1.38,444,Did he fall for me?
1,1,"00:46:38,962","00:46:40,380",1.42,445,For this face?
1,1,"00:46:42,049","00:46:43,675",1.63,446,He has very low taste.
1,1,"00:46:51,350","00:46:56,063",4.71,447,"Anyway, it might be safer for me to live here until I fully recover."
1,1,"00:46:57,523","00:47:01,568",4.05,448,"If he is head over heels for me, at least he will treat me right."
1,1,"00:47:02,736","00:47:08,200",5.46,449,Then… I guess I will have to continue living my life as Mu-deok here.
1,1,"00:47:09,576","00:47:12,496",2.92,450,"Young Master. It is me, Mu-deok."
1,1,"00:47:13,455","00:47:14,581",1.13,451,Come in.
1,1,"00:47:25,634","00:47:26,552",0.92,452,Young Master.
1,1,"00:47:26,635","00:47:31,181",4.55,453,Thank you so much for saving my life and bringing me here.
1,1,"00:47:32,224","00:47:34,309",2.09,454,It just took a few men to drag you here.
1,1,"00:47:36,019","00:47:38,730",2.71,455,I am disappointed.
1,1,"00:47:36,019","00:47:42,859",6.84,456,"I know it was rude of me to threaten you with a crab leg, but I hope you will put that behind you."
1,1,"00:47:42,943","00:47:44,444",1.50,457,You sound a lot more polite now.
1,1,"00:47:44,528","00:47:46,572",2.04,458,I will do my best to serve you right.
1,1,"00:47:47,281","00:47:48,782",1.50,459,"Fine, you do that."
1,1,"00:47:48,865","00:47:51,243",2.38,460,"Mu-deok, go and get me some water."
1,1,"00:47:51,994","00:47:53,161",1.17,461,"Yes, Young Master."
1,1,"00:48:00,419","00:48:01,253",0.83,462,Gosh.
1,1,"00:48:01,878","00:48:03,755",1.88,463,I am not thirsty. It is to wash myself.
1,1,"00:48:04,506","00:48:06,592",2.09,464,"Oh, I see. I understand, Young Master."
1,1,"00:48:11,138","00:48:13,390",2.25,465,I will just take a bath instead of washing my face.
1,1,"00:48:20,105","00:48:21,481",1.38,466,"Gosh, that is hot."
1,1,"00:48:21,565","00:48:23,525",1.96,467,This is much too hot.
1,1,"00:48:25,193","00:48:26,612",1.42,468,"Right, Young Master."
1,1,"00:48:32,909","00:48:34,411",1.50,469,"Oh, gosh. It is cold."
1,1,"00:48:34,995","00:48:36,872",1.88,470,The water is freezing.
1,1,"00:48:39,875","00:48:41,043",1.17,471,It is not freezing.
1,1,"00:48:41,126","00:48:43,503",2.38,472,It is. I will catch a cold if I wash in cold water.
1,1,"00:48:45,339","00:48:47,132",1.79,473,What is his deal?
1,1,"00:48:45,339","00:48:47,132",1.79,474,It is so cold.
1,1,"00:48:47,215","00:48:48,383",1.17,475,Did he not fall for me?
1,1,"00:48:48,467","00:48:49,926",1.46,476,"What are you doing, Mu-deok?"
1,1,"00:48:51,136","00:48:54,348",3.21,477,"Yes, Young Master."
1,1,"00:48:51,136","00:48:54,348",3.21,478,I will pour in some more hot water.
1,1,"00:49:00,187","00:49:01,021",0.83,479,It is salty.
1,1,"00:49:01,897","00:49:02,898",1.00,480,Too sweet. Too spicy.
1,1,"00:49:02,981","00:49:04,524",1.54,481,It is too long. What is this taste?
1,1,"00:49:04,608","00:49:05,859",1.25,482,I'm not going to eat.
1,1,"00:49:09,321","00:49:11,031",1.71,483,The water smells weird.
1,1,"00:49:11,740","00:49:12,658",0.92,484,It smells?
1,1,"00:49:13,659","00:49:14,951",1.29,485,Bring me a new bucket.
1,1,"00:49:18,038","00:49:18,955",0.92,486,Get a different blanket.
1,1,"00:49:19,915","00:49:22,209",2.29,487,I want the blue blanket tonight.
1,1,"00:49:44,564","00:49:48,443",3.88,488,"He does not do anything, but he washes three times a day."
1,1,"00:49:52,364","00:49:53,532",1.17,489,I will kill him.
1,1,"00:49:53,615","00:49:57,244",3.63,490,"Once I regain my energy, he'll be the first one I kill."
1,1,"00:50:01,415","00:50:04,209",2.79,491,"Young Master, I brought you cold water."
1,1,"00:50:04,918","00:50:07,337",2.42,492,I brought…
1,1,"00:50:04,918","00:50:08,880",3.96,493,Forget it. The water has cooled to just the right temperature.
1,1,"00:50:10,340","00:50:13,885",3.55,494,"Good work… I mean, your work was all in vain,"
1,1,"00:50:11,508","00:50:13,885",2.38,495,Mu-deok.
1,1,"00:50:25,063","00:50:30,527",5.46,496,If only I had the power… If I just had a fraction of the power I used to have…
1,1,"00:50:42,664","00:50:43,874",1.21,497,What is going on?
1,1,"00:50:44,583","00:50:47,836",3.25,498,What is happening?
1,1,"00:51:04,853","00:51:06,021",1.17,499,What is so funny?
1,1,"00:51:07,439","00:51:08,356",0.92,500,What?
1,1,"00:51:09,399","00:51:11,026",1.63,501,What is with that smile?
1,1,"00:51:12,027","00:51:13,111",1.08,502,It is nothing.
1,1,"00:51:13,195","00:51:14,780",1.59,503,The water is nice and cold.
1,1,"00:51:15,739","00:51:17,032",1.29,504,Go fetch my clothes.
1,1,"00:51:17,115","00:51:18,366",1.25,505,"Right, Young Master."
1,1,"00:51:20,285","00:51:21,411",1.13,506,Gosh.
1,1,"00:51:27,292","00:51:28,126",0.83,507,What are you doing?
1,1,"00:51:29,836","00:51:31,171",1.34,508,Here you go.
1,1,"00:51:33,548","00:51:35,509",1.96,509,You may leave. Get some rest.
1,1,"00:51:36,176","00:51:37,427",1.25,510,"Yes, Young Master."
1,1,"00:51:49,189","00:51:53,276",4.09,511,That Spirit Plaque will allow me to break the barrier and enter Songrim.
1,1,"00:51:55,195","00:51:58,990",3.79,512,But I cannot do that right now because I do not have the power to cast spells.
1,1,"00:52:00,617","00:52:01,868",1.25,513,I should find my sword.
1,1,"00:52:03,411","00:52:06,331",2.92,514,I might get my power back if I find my sword.
1,1,"00:52:09,793","00:52:14,631",4.84,515,"With that Spirit Plaque, I will be able to enter Songrim."
1,1,"00:52:18,802","00:52:22,639",3.84,516,SONGRIM
1,1,"00:52:23,807","00:52:27,060",3.25,517,How long do you plan to keep
1,1,"00:52:23,807","00:52:27,060",3.25,518,Naksu's body at Jeongjingak?
1,1,"00:52:27,727","00:52:29,813",2.09,519,"If she succeeded in finding a new body,"
1,1,"00:52:30,355","00:52:33,859",3.50,520,Naksu… will come back for her sword.
1,1,"00:52:35,610","00:52:38,864",3.25,521,She will come here looking for her body.
1,1,"00:52:40,198","00:52:42,284",2.09,522,Let us see how things turn out.
1,1,"00:52:48,957","00:52:54,546",5.59,523,"Maybe it is because your father's room is always empty, but it never seems to get dusty."
1,1,"00:52:55,630","00:52:57,424",1.79,524,I wonder when he will return.
1,1,"00:53:01,386","00:53:04,848",3.46,525,The colors in your mother's portrait are starting to fade away.
1,1,"00:53:05,473","00:53:07,934",2.46,526,We should call a painter to repaint the colors.
1,1,"00:53:30,624","00:53:33,084",2.46,527,I memorized all the books you told me to read.
1,1,"00:53:33,668","00:53:37,881",4.21,528,"Now, teach me how to practice spells just like how you taught Yul and Dang-gu."
1,1,"00:53:46,473","00:53:49,184",2.71,529,That sword belongs to your father.
1,1,"00:53:49,267","00:53:50,560",1.29,530,Take it out.
1,1,"00:54:03,698","00:54:08,370",4.67,531,"Due to the spell that has been cast on me, I am unable to take out a sword that has a spell on it."
1,1,"00:54:08,870","00:54:11,122",2.25,532,You cannot even take out your own father's sword.
1,1,"00:54:11,206","00:54:12,874",1.67,533,How do you expect to learn spells?
1,1,"00:54:12,958","00:54:15,835",2.88,534,Why can you not open my gate of energy so I can practice casting spells?
1,1,"00:54:15,919","00:54:19,422",3.50,535,I… cannot do that.
1,1,"00:54:20,799","00:54:24,219",3.42,536,Then find me another master.
1,1,"00:54:24,928","00:54:26,346",1.42,537,No master can do that.
1,1,"00:54:27,263","00:54:31,726",4.46,538,No one in Daeho will be able to go against your father and open your gate of energy.
1,1,"00:54:31,810","00:54:36,106",4.30,539,Then are you saying I will never have the ability to practice spells?
1,1,"00:54:36,189","00:54:41,403",5.21,540,That was the fate given to you by your father.
1,1,"00:54:42,362","00:54:44,239",1.88,541,Why!
1,1,"00:54:44,322","00:54:46,241",1.92,542,Why would he decide my own fate?
1,1,"00:54:47,492","00:54:49,869",2.38,543,No one even considers him as my true father anyway!
1,1,"00:54:51,413","00:54:52,872",1.46,544,I will find someone.
1,1,"00:54:53,957","00:54:57,961",4.00,545,A master who will open my gate of energy and teach me how to practice spells.
1,1,"00:54:58,795","00:55:00,588",1.79,546,I will find someone myself.
1,1,"00:55:01,965","00:55:04,342",2.38,547,Then I will take out that sword and break it in two.
1,1,"00:55:30,577","00:55:33,038",2.46,548,I heard Young Master Jang got expelled again.
1,1,"00:55:33,705","00:55:36,916",3.21,549,Why would the son of the great Lord Jang always get in so much trouble?
1,1,"00:55:37,000","00:55:38,710",1.71,550,He is not his son.
1,1,"00:55:38,793","00:55:43,590",4.80,551,"Do-hwa, the most beautiful woman in Daeho, slept with another man and had Jang Uk."
1,1,"00:55:44,174","00:55:45,800",1.63,552,I doubt that rumor is true.
1,1,"00:55:45,884","00:55:50,972",5.09,553,Then why would he block his son from casting spells and live his life like a vagabond?
1,1,"00:55:51,973","00:55:56,019",4.05,554,I wonder if he is really weak because his father put a spell on him.
1,1,"00:56:05,737","00:56:07,697",1.96,555,The Spirit Plaque should be here somewhere.
1,1,"00:56:22,003","00:56:23,463",1.46,556,Where is it?
1,1,"00:56:48,822","00:56:50,782",1.96,557,Why did I have to hide here?
1,1,"00:56:50,865","00:56:52,450",1.59,558,What will he think of me?
1,1,"00:56:53,368","00:56:54,619",1.25,559,What should I say to him?
1,1,"00:57:01,126","00:57:03,795",2.67,560,This was not what I had in mind when I brought you here.
1,1,"00:57:05,797","00:57:06,631",0.83,561,Well…
1,1,"00:57:07,340","00:57:12,053",4.71,562,"You kept saying you were cold, so I was just heating the bedding for you."
1,1,"00:57:12,137","00:57:15,014",2.88,563,"If you lie down right away, it will be nice and warm all night."
1,1,"00:57:15,098","00:57:16,266",1.17,564,Is that so?
1,1,"00:57:17,851","00:57:19,018",1.17,565,How kind of you.
1,1,"00:57:23,440","00:57:25,650",2.21,566,"Good night, then."
1,1,"00:57:23,440","00:57:25,650",2.21,567,Where are you going?
1,1,"00:57:27,819","00:57:29,195",1.38,568,You came to keep me warm.
1,1,"00:57:30,947","00:57:36,494",5.55,569,Keep my bed nice and hot all night long.
1,1,"00:57:38,580","00:57:39,747",1.17,570,Heat it up.
1,1,"00:57:44,002","00:57:47,172",3.17,571,What? Does he really like me?
1,1,"00:57:47,255","00:57:48,840",1.59,572,Have I fallen for his tricks?
1,1,"00:57:57,223","00:57:58,099",0.88,573,Young Master…
1,1,"00:57:59,058","00:58:01,644",2.59,574,My body is not warm enough to keep you warm.
1,1,"00:58:01,728","00:58:03,730",2.00,575,"Ever since I was young, I easily got the chills."
1,1,"00:58:03,813","00:58:06,566",2.75,576,So my body temperature is always very low.
1,1,"00:58:13,573","00:58:14,782",1.21,577,All right.
1,1,"00:58:28,421","00:58:31,466",3.05,578,I do not plan on doing what you want me to do.
1,1,"00:58:41,309","00:58:43,686",2.38,579,Bring the brazier closer to me.
1,1,"00:58:47,565","00:58:48,733",1.17,580,The brazier?
1,1,"00:58:49,317","00:58:53,530",4.21,581,I just wanted you to bring the brazier near my bed and keep it hot.
1,1,"00:58:57,867","00:58:59,327",1.46,582,Keep it hot.
1,1,"00:59:05,959","00:59:06,834",0.88,583,Here.
1,1,"00:59:07,418","00:59:09,295",1.88,584,This is too close.
1,1,"00:59:10,630","00:59:12,090",1.46,585,It will be too hot.
1,1,"00:59:12,966","00:59:14,968",2.00,586,"Oh, right. It will be too hot."
1,1,"00:59:18,930","00:59:20,807",1.88,587,I will sell you if the fire goes out.
1,1,"00:59:20,890","00:59:22,517",1.63,588,Keep the fire alive all night.
1,1,"00:59:22,600","00:59:23,726",1.13,589,"All right, Young Master."
1,1,"00:59:35,613","00:59:38,950",3.34,590,All right. Dang-gu is here.
1,1,"00:59:42,453","00:59:44,664",2.21,591,What is that? It is a whistle.
1,1,"00:59:45,415","00:59:46,249",0.83,592,Yes.
1,1,"00:59:47,208","00:59:48,876",1.67,593,I swear I made this.
1,1,"00:59:48,960","00:59:52,171",3.21,594,"Oh, right. I remember."
1,1,"00:59:48,960","00:59:52,171",3.21,595,You used to have a pet bird.
1,1,"00:59:52,255","00:59:54,090",1.84,596,Why? Are you planning to get a new one?
1,1,"00:59:55,425","00:59:56,634",1.21,597,"No, not exactly."
1,1,"00:59:56,718","00:59:58,636",1.92,598,I just found this on someone unexpected.
1,1,"00:59:59,804","01:00:02,056",2.25,599,I wonder why she had it.
1,1,"01:00:02,140","01:00:03,349",1.21,600,Maybe you gave it to her.
1,1,"01:00:03,933","01:00:06,019",2.09,601,Maybe you forgot that you gave it to her.
1,1,"01:00:06,102","01:00:07,186",1.08,602,No.
1,1,"01:00:08,062","01:00:10,356",2.29,603,I clearly remember who I gave this to.
1,1,"01:00:27,457","01:00:30,251",2.79,604,Then go ask her.
1,1,"01:00:37,091","01:00:39,844",2.75,605,You are going to go at this hour?
1,1,"01:00:39,927","01:00:41,346",1.42,606,I need to check something.
1,1,"01:02:36,586","01:02:38,045",1.46,607,Who are those guys?
1,1,"01:02:53,770","01:02:55,021",1.25,608,Intruders!
1,1,"01:02:55,730","01:02:57,440",1.71,609,We have intruders!
1,1,"01:02:57,523","01:02:58,816",1.29,610,Intruders!
1,1,"01:03:57,291","01:03:58,543",1.25,611,Go on.
1,1,"01:04:29,574","01:04:30,616",1.04,612,Out of the way!
1,1,"01:05:11,157","01:05:13,743",2.59,613,"Yul, what is going on?"
1,1,"01:05:17,330","01:05:18,789",1.46,614,The Training Center is on fire.
1,1,"01:05:26,756","01:05:28,466",1.71,615,Who is at Jeongjingak?
1,1,"01:05:28,549","01:05:30,051",1.50,616,Master Yul and Dang-gu.
1,1,"01:05:33,262","01:05:34,639",1.38,617,"Uncle, are you all right?"
1,1,"01:05:35,848","01:05:37,058",1.21,618,The intruders all left.
1,1,"01:05:39,226","01:05:40,937",1.71,619,Jeongjingak is empty.
1,1,"01:05:51,697","01:05:53,115",1.42,620,Find them.
1,1,"01:05:51,697","01:05:53,115",1.42,621,"Yes, my lord."
1,1,"01:06:03,584","01:06:05,211",1.63,622,Who were those guys?
1,1,"01:06:06,212","01:06:08,130",1.92,623,Did the Danju send them here?
1,1,"01:06:11,217","01:06:14,595",3.38,624,"The soul you need to collect this time is Park Jin, the leader of Songrim."
1,1,"01:06:18,391","01:06:19,517",1.13,625,Right.
1,1,"01:06:20,601","01:06:22,812",2.21,626,He must have sent them here to retrieve my body.
1,1,"01:06:30,695","01:06:31,946",1.25,627,Who is there?
1,1,"01:07:05,146","01:07:06,022",0.88,628,Young Master?
1,1,"01:07:20,244","01:07:21,704",1.46,629,What are you doing here?
1,1,"01:07:25,124","01:07:26,417",1.29,630,Because of your eyes.
1,1,"01:07:27,585","01:07:28,461",0.88,631,My eyes?
1,1,"01:07:51,150","01:07:52,777",1.63,632,I knew the moment I saw you.
1,1,"01:07:55,446","01:07:56,864",1.42,633,You are my master.
