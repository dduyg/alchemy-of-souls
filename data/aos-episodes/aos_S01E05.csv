1,5,"00:00:50,800","00:00:55,050",4.25,1,"Here, at Cheonbugwan, we have records of all the constellations."
1,5,"00:00:55,138","00:00:58,388",3.25,2,Even the one on your birthday.
1,5,"00:00:55,138","00:00:58,388",3.25,3,Would you like to see it?
1,5,"00:00:58,475","00:01:00,135",1.66,4,"Yes, Father."
1,5,"00:01:01,019","00:01:02,559",1.54,5,All right. Let us go.
1,5,"00:01:15,116","00:01:16,366",1.25,6,There it is.
1,5,"00:01:20,497","00:01:26,377",5.88,7,My father studied stars and kept records of them as he was a constellation recorder mage at Cheonbugwan.
1,5,"00:01:39,682","00:01:40,682",1.00,8,My lady!
1,5,"00:01:40,767","00:01:41,937",1.17,9,My lady!
1,5,"00:01:51,945","00:01:54,155",2.21,10,"My lady, stay inside and do not come out."
1,5,"00:01:55,990","00:01:58,330",2.34,11,"If you see your father, run away."
1,5,"00:01:58,827","00:02:00,247",1.42,12,Do not let him catch you.
1,5,"00:02:24,853","00:02:26,193",1.34,13,Father…
1,5,"00:03:23,119","00:03:25,039",1.92,14,I will give you power.
1,5,"00:03:25,872","00:03:27,252",1.38,15,Will you come with me?
1,5,"00:03:36,507","00:03:41,756",5.25,16,"The day my father was killed by the four families of Daeho, I followed Jin Mu."
1,5,"00:03:43,097","00:03:48,515",5.42,17,I was raised as if I was cut off from the world in the deep and dangerous valleys of Danhyanggok.
1,5,"00:04:19,759","00:04:24,555",4.80,18,I do not know if I toughened up to survive or if I survived because I was tough.
1,5,"00:04:28,768","00:04:35,357",6.59,19,"By the time my past self and my father had been forgotten, I finally returned to the world as Naksu."
1,5,"00:04:40,655","00:04:42,525",1.87,20,But Naksu is dead now.
1,5,"00:04:43,241","00:04:54,093",10.85,21,"I have returned to this place as Mu-deok, along with an incapable young master who is also an unmotivated pupil."
1,5,"00:04:54,168","00:04:56,498",2.33,22,How far do we have to go?
1,5,"00:04:56,587","00:04:57,877",1.29,23,This bracelet weighs a ton.
1,5,"00:04:57,964","00:05:00,014",2.05,24,"Master, your pupil is exhausted."
1,5,"00:05:00,091","00:05:02,721",2.63,25,I am done.
1,5,"00:05:00,091","00:05:02,721",2.63,26,I am too tired to go any further.
1,5,"00:05:02,802","00:05:04,892",2.09,27,I am the one carrying all the luggage.
1,5,"00:05:04,971","00:05:07,601",2.63,28,"I am your young master, and you are my maid."
1,5,"00:05:07,682","00:05:08,932",1.25,29,That is your job.
1,5,"00:05:09,017","00:05:13,227",4.21,30,So I am your master when you are in need but your maid when you need a servant?
1,5,"00:05:13,313","00:05:14,363",1.05,31,Of course.
1,5,"00:05:18,776","00:05:22,993",4.22,32,I did not know there was a place like this right outside the city.
1,5,"00:05:23,072","00:05:26,782",3.71,33,This is a place so rugged and remote that even echoes cannot be heard.
1,5,"00:05:27,910","00:05:29,200",1.29,34,"Hence the name, Danhyanggok."
1,5,"00:05:34,542","00:05:35,842",1.30,35,I hear the echoes just fine.
1,5,"00:05:35,918","00:05:37,208",1.29,36,It was a figure of speech.
1,5,"00:05:37,295","00:05:38,705",1.41,37,The name is just a bluff.
1,5,"00:05:40,256","00:05:41,256",1.00,38,I am hungry.
1,5,"00:05:43,217","00:05:45,257",2.04,39,Up there is where I used to live.
1,5,"00:05:45,344","00:05:51,178",5.83,40,You will eat what I provide for you and sleep where you collapse after a hard day's training.
1,5,"00:05:54,479","00:05:55,899",1.42,41,What is this? I smell chicken.
1,5,"00:05:57,774","00:06:00,494",2.72,42,Do they sell chicken here?
1,5,"00:05:57,774","00:06:00,494",2.72,43,Who would sell chicken here?
1,5,"00:06:03,321","00:06:05,491",2.17,44,"You smell chicken too, right?"
1,5,"00:06:05,573","00:06:07,243",1.67,45,I am telling you. It is chicken.
1,5,"00:06:07,825","00:06:10,535",2.71,46,I am sure it is chicken. I love chicken.
1,5,"00:06:11,329","00:06:12,909",1.58,47,How did you climb up there?
1,5,"00:06:13,915","00:06:15,705",1.79,48,Someone must be cooking chicken nearby.
1,5,"00:06:15,792","00:06:17,462",1.67,49,Come on down. Why are you up there?
1,5,"00:06:26,677","00:06:27,797",1.12,50,See? It is chicken.
1,5,"00:06:27,887","00:06:30,927",3.04,51,I told you I smelled chicken.
1,5,"00:06:27,887","00:06:30,927",3.04,52,It is so nice here!
1,5,"00:06:50,493","00:06:52,373",1.88,53,Why are these things here?
1,5,"00:06:54,497","00:06:55,327",0.83,54,Mu-deok!
1,5,"00:06:56,374","00:06:58,294",1.92,55,There is even a bath here!
1,5,"00:07:07,760","00:07:08,680",0.92,56,Mu-deok.
1,5,"00:07:09,262","00:07:12,932",3.67,57,"There are tons of things to eat, and the bathtub is nice too."
1,5,"00:07:13,015","00:07:15,175",2.16,58,"Master, you had yourself a pretty nice place."
1,5,"00:07:15,268","00:07:17,518",2.25,59,Did you really have to scare your pupil like that?
1,5,"00:07:17,603","00:07:18,443",0.84,60,You are one weird…
1,5,"00:07:20,773","00:07:22,193",1.42,61,There is even a blanket.
1,5,"00:07:24,193","00:07:26,743",2.55,62,This is so soft. It is nice and comfy.
1,5,"00:07:27,613","00:07:29,033",1.42,63,These are not mine.
1,5,"00:07:30,491","00:07:32,371",1.88,64,Someone else is living here.
1,5,"00:07:37,665","00:07:38,875",1.21,65,Mu-deok.
1,5,"00:07:38,958","00:07:42,338",3.38,66,Should we eat the chicken?
1,5,"00:07:38,958","00:07:42,338",3.38,67,I noticed that it was nicely cooked.
1,5,"00:07:42,420","00:07:43,590",1.17,68,Mu-deok?
1,5,"00:07:49,343","00:07:50,763",1.42,69,Is it a man?
1,5,"00:08:12,366","00:08:13,656",1.29,70,Quiet! Stop!
1,5,"00:08:15,495","00:08:16,995",1.50,71,Stay still.
1,5,"00:08:29,425","00:08:30,425",1.00,72,Good boy.
1,5,"00:08:30,510","00:08:32,350",1.84,73,You are well-trained. Do you live here?
1,5,"00:08:33,054","00:08:34,474",1.42,74,He is not a stray dog.
1,5,"00:08:35,473","00:08:36,723",1.25,75,Where is your owner?
1,5,"00:08:37,558","00:08:39,518",1.96,76,"Hey, Fluffy. Go bring your owner."
1,5,"00:08:41,729","00:08:43,729",2.00,77,What a clever dog.
1,5,"00:08:45,858","00:08:47,398",1.54,78,Who could it be?
1,5,"00:08:47,485","00:08:52,278",4.79,79,"It cannot be one of Danju's men, seeing that this person is not trying to hide him or herself."
1,5,"00:08:54,951","00:08:56,041",1.09,80,There is tea.
1,5,"00:08:56,118","00:08:59,158",3.04,81,"We are guests, so it would not be rude to have a cup, right?"
1,5,"00:09:00,456","00:09:01,916",1.46,82,Watch what you eat or drink.
1,5,"00:09:02,708","00:09:04,748",2.04,83,We need to check who lives here first.
1,5,"00:09:04,835","00:09:06,625",1.79,84,Then we will decide what to do next.
1,5,"00:09:06,712","00:09:07,962",1.25,85,So you really have no idea?
1,5,"00:09:08,589","00:09:09,419",0.83,86,What?
1,5,"00:09:09,507","00:09:13,804",4.30,87,"There is a dog, a bunch of flowers, roasted chicken, and a pot of tea."
1,5,"00:09:13,886","00:09:15,176",1.29,88,I almost had the wrong idea.
1,5,"00:09:15,805","00:09:16,635",0.83,89,What do you mean?
1,5,"00:09:16,722","00:09:21,561",4.84,90,I almost misunderstood you for trying to kidnap and make me live with you on the pretense of training me.
1,5,"00:09:21,644","00:09:26,151",4.51,91,"If that dog wagged its tail at you, I would have thought that this was all part of your plan."
1,5,"00:09:26,232","00:09:28,362",2.13,92,This place is big enough for two or three kids.
1,5,"00:09:29,068","00:09:30,948",1.88,93,It was not like this when I lived here.
1,5,"00:09:31,529","00:09:35,579",4.05,94,"It was completely barren and perfect for training, which is why I brought you here."
1,5,"00:09:37,159","00:09:38,449",1.29,95,So just for training?
1,5,"00:09:39,787","00:09:41,157",1.37,96,Was that all you had in mind?
1,5,"00:09:41,872","00:09:45,495",3.62,97,Forget it! Go ahead and eat or drink whatever you wish and get yourself killed.
1,5,"00:09:47,336","00:09:48,166",0.83,98,Unbelievable.
1,5,"00:09:48,254","00:09:51,924",3.67,99,I cannot believe she would say that to me just because I made a joke.
1,5,"00:09:52,008","00:09:55,178",3.17,100,I was a fool to have followed her all the way here.
1,5,"00:09:55,761","00:09:56,721",0.96,101,Goodness.
1,5,"00:10:05,396","00:10:11,494",6.10,102,Just stay a clueless Young Master of the Jang family.
1,5,"00:10:13,362","00:10:17,368",4.01,103,I would rather live here than live that way.
1,5,"00:11:03,913","00:11:08,463",4.55,104,"Today, the leader of Jinyowon has gathered the mages of Daeho to hold a Unanimous Assembly."
1,5,"00:11:09,001","00:11:12,461",3.46,105,All 11 families have gathered aside from Jang Gang of the Jang family.
1,5,"00:11:12,546","00:11:16,466",3.92,106,Is my duel with Jang Uk that big of a deal?
1,5,"00:11:17,051","00:11:19,471",2.42,107,It is a duel between a royal family member and a mage.
1,5,"00:11:19,553","00:11:21,353",1.80,108,The last one was hundreds of years ago.
1,5,"00:11:21,430","00:11:26,138",4.71,109,I am merely trying to punish Jang Uk for having looked down on me.
1,5,"00:11:26,227","00:11:27,597",1.37,110,This is not a personal matter.
1,5,"00:11:28,479","00:11:31,229",2.75,111,"His Majesty gave his orders, and the mages have gathered."
1,5,"00:11:31,315","00:11:34,985",3.67,112,"If they agree to this duel, the fight will become official."
1,5,"00:11:36,779","00:11:42,577",5.80,113,A crack has formed and damaged the stability and peace that had existed between the royal family and mages.
1,5,"00:11:55,673","00:11:59,843",4.17,114,Did you really agree with depriving Uk's right to become the next Gwanju?
1,5,"00:12:01,053","00:12:02,433",1.38,115,"Yes, it is true."
1,5,"00:12:07,101","00:12:11,111",4.01,116,This duel is merely to resolve the misunderstanding between the Crown Prince and Uk.
1,5,"00:12:11,188","00:12:17,815",6.63,117,"As for the Gwanju position, I already have someone else in mind other than Jang Uk to recommend for it."
1,5,"00:12:17,903","00:12:19,743",1.84,118,Having it taken away is different from giving it up.
1,5,"00:12:20,948","00:12:24,118",3.17,119,I heard Jang Uk ran away before he even received the duel offer.
1,5,"00:12:26,328","00:12:27,708",1.38,120,How embarrassing.
1,5,"00:12:27,788","00:12:31,208",3.42,121,He should fight honorably and die as a mage with integrity.
1,5,"00:12:31,292","00:12:33,542",2.25,122,Uk does not have the guts to do that.
1,5,"00:12:34,962","00:12:37,882",2.92,123,Everyone here has been his master.
1,5,"00:12:37,965","00:12:40,585",2.62,124,Right.
1,5,"00:12:37,965","00:12:40,585",2.62,125,He never had any kind of potential.
1,5,"00:12:40,676","00:12:44,176",3.50,126,I do not wish for us mages to be disgraced like this.
1,5,"00:12:44,263","00:12:46,933",2.67,127,What if we disqualify Uk of his rights as a mage?
1,5,"00:12:50,227","00:12:57,032",6.81,128,"If we disqualify his rights followed by a unanimous vote, his energy flow will be cut off, and he will lose all his power."
1,5,"00:12:57,109","00:12:59,819",2.71,129,Are you suggesting we ruin the young man's life forever?
1,5,"00:12:59,904","00:13:01,744",1.84,130,"Still, it will help us stop the duel."
1,5,"00:13:02,656","00:13:06,906",4.25,131,Uk's gate of energy was closed anyway thanks to his father.
1,5,"00:13:06,994","00:13:08,914",1.92,132,He is right.
1,5,"00:13:06,994","00:13:08,914",1.92,133,He has a point.
1,5,"00:13:08,996","00:13:14,285",5.29,134,All of you here have once taught Uk as his master.
1,5,"00:13:17,421","00:13:22,261",4.84,135,How could you be so nonchalant about ruining the life of someone who once used to be your pupil?
1,5,"00:13:24,178","00:13:27,388",3.21,136,Songrim has accepted the royal family's duel.
1,5,"00:13:27,473","00:13:30,393",2.92,137,Songrim will take on the disgrace that may or may not occur.
1,5,"00:13:30,976","00:13:34,556",3.58,138,Then make sure it becomes an official duel between Songrim and the royal family.
1,5,"00:13:36,398","00:13:37,228",0.83,139,I will.
1,5,"00:13:38,651","00:13:41,701",3.05,140,I heard Uk mastered Ryusu in a very short amount of time.
1,5,"00:13:42,696","00:13:45,276",2.58,141,Was he taught by someone in Songrim?
1,5,"00:13:48,953","00:13:57,629",8.68,142,"No matter where he goes, whether it is Songrim or not, there will be no master for Uk."
1,5,"00:14:02,174","00:14:04,684",2.51,143,The water is nice and clean.
1,5,"00:14:02,174","00:14:04,684",2.51,144,My skin feels so soft.
1,5,"00:14:04,760","00:14:06,050",1.29,145,Maybe it is mineral water.
1,5,"00:14:06,720","00:14:10,390",3.67,146,"Mu-deok, the owner of this place seems like a very neat person."
1,5,"00:14:10,474","00:14:11,984",1.51,147,I do not think he will be back…
1,5,"00:14:15,479","00:14:16,519",1.04,148,Goodness.
1,5,"00:14:31,078","00:14:32,578",1.50,149,She is completely knocked out.
1,5,"00:14:33,205","00:14:34,825",1.62,150,"Of course, you are tired."
1,5,"00:14:34,915","00:14:37,535",2.62,151,"We could have taken our time, but you insisted on hurrying."
1,5,"00:14:37,626","00:14:40,586",2.96,152,"You are Mu-deok now, not Naksu."
1,5,"00:14:37,626","00:14:40,586",2.96,153,You do not have the strength.
1,5,"00:14:45,551","00:14:46,931",1.38,154,"Oh, gosh. This is…"
1,5,"00:14:47,761","00:14:48,801",1.04,155,This is heavy.
1,5,"00:14:48,888","00:14:50,428",1.54,156,What a fool.
1,5,"00:14:50,514","00:14:53,394",2.88,157,"If it was this heavy, she should have asked for help."
1,5,"00:15:01,275","00:15:02,735",1.46,158,It is so comfy.
1,5,"00:15:08,282","00:15:13,451",5.17,159,"I am a young master, and she is my maid. That is right."
1,5,"00:15:14,872","00:15:16,672",1.80,160,It is only right that I sleep here.
1,5,"00:15:29,762","00:15:32,472",2.71,161,"Gosh, this is making me feel uneasy."
1,5,"00:15:42,024","00:15:43,074",1.05,162,All right.
1,5,"00:15:56,288","00:15:57,368",1.08,163,Master.
1,5,"00:15:57,456","00:15:58,866",1.41,164,Please get a good night's rest.
1,5,"00:16:23,649","00:16:25,109",1.46,165,This is so uncomfortable.
1,5,"00:16:53,470","00:16:55,930",2.46,166,Are you saying there is a soul shifter inside?
1,5,"00:16:59,601","00:17:01,191",1.59,167,How interesting.
1,5,"00:17:29,048","00:17:32,931",3.88,168,I would not have recognized her without your help since her soul has no malice.
1,5,"00:17:37,765","00:17:41,845",4.08,169,You will be better off dying in my hands than to run wild and be petrified.
1,5,"00:18:09,755","00:18:12,465",2.71,170,A great soul has shifted into this body.
1,5,"00:18:13,801","00:18:18,181",4.38,171,"She should have run wild by now, judging by how weak this body looks."
1,5,"00:18:18,263","00:18:20,183",1.92,172,How is she still fine?
1,5,"00:18:28,148","00:18:31,858",3.71,173,I feel no energy around her.
1,5,"00:18:28,148","00:18:31,858",3.71,174,Where did it all disappear to?
1,5,"00:18:37,866","00:18:39,276",1.41,175,Who are you?
1,5,"00:18:41,370","00:18:43,160",1.79,176,And you are?
1,5,"00:18:43,247","00:18:45,247",2.00,177,Step away from Mu-deok.
1,5,"00:20:20,135","00:20:23,095",2.96,178,That sword was given to the Cheonbugwan's Gwanju by the king.
1,5,"00:20:23,680","00:20:24,970",1.29,179,Who are you?
1,5,"00:20:25,807","00:20:27,807",2.00,180,What are you doing with a girl like her?
1,5,"00:20:32,022","00:20:32,942",0.92,181,"Mu-deok, run!"
1,5,"00:22:00,152","00:22:02,612",2.46,182,"Hey, you are up."
1,5,"00:22:07,200","00:22:08,240",1.04,183,Who is he?
1,5,"00:22:08,327","00:22:09,617",1.29,184,The man you saw last night.
1,5,"00:22:10,996","00:22:12,246",1.25,185,The man I saw last night?
1,5,"00:22:12,331","00:22:13,541",1.21,186,Yes. Do you not remember?
1,5,"00:22:18,295","00:22:19,545",1.25,187,"Mu-deok, run!"
1,5,"00:22:55,791","00:22:57,581",1.79,188,I apologize about last night.
1,5,"00:22:57,667","00:23:02,586",4.92,189,"I saw someone inside the hut, and you suddenly wielded your sword at me, so I had no choice."
1,5,"00:23:02,672","00:23:04,012",1.34,190,I was startled too.
1,5,"00:23:04,091","00:23:06,681",2.59,191,I am not trained enough to control the energy in my arm.
1,5,"00:23:06,760","00:23:08,640",1.88,192,I had no intentions of harming you.
1,5,"00:23:08,720","00:23:11,724",3.00,193,Did you two… fight?
1,5,"00:23:15,644","00:23:17,854",2.21,194,Do you not remember anything from last night?
1,5,"00:23:19,106","00:23:20,316",1.21,195,No.
1,5,"00:23:20,398","00:23:22,938",2.54,196,You stood right there and watched us fight.
1,5,"00:23:23,026","00:23:24,276",1.25,197,I did?
1,5,"00:23:24,361","00:23:25,241",0.88,198,What?
1,5,"00:23:25,862","00:23:27,612",1.75,199,I guess you sleepwalk.
1,5,"00:23:27,697","00:23:31,277",3.58,200,I will get you medicinal herbs for that.
1,5,"00:23:27,697","00:23:31,277",3.58,201,Brew them and drink the tea.
1,5,"00:23:31,910","00:23:33,370",1.46,202,Are you a herbalist?
1,5,"00:23:33,453","00:23:37,252",3.80,203,"No, but he is staying here to pick some medicinal herbs that are only found in Danhyanggok."
1,5,"00:23:37,332","00:23:38,252",0.92,204,Call me Master Lee.
1,5,"00:23:38,834","00:23:42,956",4.12,205,"There is enough food and space for all of us, so make yourselves at home."
1,5,"00:23:46,341","00:23:47,881",1.54,206,"All right, Sapsali."
1,5,"00:23:50,178","00:23:51,558",1.38,207,Do you really not remember?
1,5,"00:23:51,638","00:23:53,638",2.00,208,Did I really sleepwalk last night?
1,5,"00:24:07,654","00:24:08,914",1.26,209,I swear I was on the floor…
1,5,"00:24:08,989","00:24:11,449",2.46,210,That soul shifter is special.
1,5,"00:24:11,533","00:24:14,743",3.21,211,There is a great soul dwelling inside that small body.
1,5,"00:24:17,038","00:24:18,998",1.96,212,Let us get to know her a bit.
1,5,"00:24:19,082","00:24:20,542",1.46,213,Do not lie.
1,5,"00:24:20,625","00:24:23,205",2.58,214,I am serious. I moved you so you could sleep comfortably.
1,5,"00:24:23,295","00:24:24,665",1.37,215,What is your relationship?
1,5,"00:24:26,423","00:24:27,633",1.21,216,Are you married?
1,5,"00:24:27,716","00:24:28,926",1.21,217,No.
1,5,"00:24:27,716","00:24:28,926",1.21,218,No.
1,5,"00:24:29,885","00:24:33,045",3.16,219,You did not put me on the bed.
1,5,"00:24:29,885","00:24:33,045",3.16,220,I remember sleeping on the floor.
1,5,"00:24:33,138","00:24:35,178",2.04,221,Why would I lie to you? I really--
1,5,"00:24:35,265","00:24:36,555",1.29,222,You always lie.
1,5,"00:24:35,265","00:24:36,555",1.29,223,They must be married.
1,5,"00:24:37,475","00:24:38,635",1.16,224,We are not.
1,5,"00:24:37,475","00:24:38,635",1.16,225,We are not.
1,5,"00:24:39,227","00:24:40,807",1.58,226,So did you win?
1,5,"00:24:40,896","00:24:42,436",1.54,227,"No, I lost. But…"
1,5,"00:24:43,315","00:24:44,685",1.37,228,He is very strong.
1,5,"00:24:44,774","00:24:46,994",2.22,229,He is--
1,5,"00:24:44,774","00:24:46,994",2.22,230,Good for you. I knew it.
1,5,"00:24:47,068","00:24:48,108",1.04,231,What?
1,5,"00:24:52,449","00:24:55,829",3.38,232,They even held a gathering.
1,5,"00:24:52,449","00:24:55,829",3.38,233,Things are getting out of hand.
1,5,"00:24:55,911","00:24:59,251",3.34,234,Do you think Uk and Mu-deok are all right?
1,5,"00:24:59,331","00:25:02,001",2.67,235,"They went to Sari Village, Mu-deok's hometown."
1,5,"00:25:02,083","00:25:03,253",1.17,236,She must be happy.
1,5,"00:25:05,086","00:25:06,666",1.58,237,Why would she be happy?
1,5,"00:25:06,755","00:25:07,875",1.12,238,She had to leave you.
1,5,"00:25:07,964","00:25:10,224",2.26,239,So?
1,5,"00:25:07,964","00:25:10,224",2.26,240,"Goodness, you fool."
1,5,"00:25:10,300","00:25:12,220",1.92,241,Mu-deok is in love with you.
1,5,"00:25:14,846","00:25:18,480",3.63,242,She only said that so she could help Uk.
1,5,"00:25:18,558","00:25:20,268",1.71,243,Sure. Whatever.
1,5,"00:25:23,271","00:25:26,191",2.92,244,I heard Young Master Jang ran away.
1,5,"00:25:26,274","00:25:30,404",4.13,245,He did not run away.
1,5,"00:25:26,274","00:25:30,404",4.13,246,He just fled to take refuge.
1,5,"00:25:30,487","00:25:31,947",1.46,247,What is the difference?
1,5,"00:25:32,030","00:25:34,700",2.67,248,Does that mean he went to Danhyanggok with Mu-deok?
1,5,"00:25:36,576","00:25:38,656",2.08,249,Danhyanggok?
1,5,"00:25:36,576","00:25:38,656",2.08,250,Yes.
1,5,"00:25:38,745","00:25:42,115",3.37,251,She lit firecrackers there recently under Young Master Jang's orders.
1,5,"00:25:42,207","00:25:44,787",2.58,252,I remember seeing the fireworks from the fortress.
1,5,"00:25:44,876","00:25:47,956",3.08,253,I figured that was where they went since it is not too far away.
1,5,"00:25:48,046","00:25:50,716",2.67,254,Did I guess correctly?
1,5,"00:25:48,046","00:25:50,716",2.67,255,No.
1,5,"00:25:50,799","00:25:53,679",2.88,256,"Mu-deok took him to Sari Village, her hometown."
1,5,"00:25:53,760","00:25:55,760",2.00,257,"Oh, I see. Sari Village."
1,5,"00:25:55,845","00:25:57,965",2.12,258,Do not tell anyone that Uk is there.
1,5,"00:25:58,556","00:26:00,226",1.67,259,All right. I will not.
1,5,"00:26:00,308","00:26:01,428",1.12,260,Enjoy.
1,5,"00:26:03,603","00:26:05,943",2.34,261,Mu-deok used to go to Danhyanggok?
1,5,"00:26:06,022","00:26:07,522",1.50,262,That place is pretty dangerous.
1,5,"00:26:07,607","00:26:09,937",2.33,263,Is that the place where you kept your pet bird?
1,5,"00:26:10,652","00:26:12,702",2.05,264,You hurt your leg there and worried everyone.
1,5,"00:26:13,655","00:26:15,065",1.41,265,"Yes, it was Danhyanggok."
1,5,"00:26:17,242","00:26:19,412",2.17,266,I had forgotten all about that place.
1,5,"00:26:33,091","00:26:34,221",1.13,267,The fire is weak.
1,5,"00:26:39,264","00:26:41,894",2.63,268,"His body must be filled with energy, judging by his strength."
1,5,"00:26:44,894","00:26:46,604",1.71,269,He has mastered Jipsu.
1,5,"00:26:47,230","00:26:49,610",2.38,270,Jipsu? That means he is as strong as I am.
1,5,"00:26:49,691","00:26:52,071",2.38,271,No wonder it was not easy to fight him.
1,5,"00:27:01,619","00:27:03,789",2.17,272,He is using his energy to control fire.
1,5,"00:27:03,872","00:27:07,004",3.13,273,He is far above the Ryusu level.
1,5,"00:27:07,083","00:27:09,133",2.05,274,RYUSU: THE STAGE OF EMITTING ENERGY FROM THE BODY
1,5,"00:27:09,711","00:27:10,671",0.96,275,Ryusu?
1,5,"00:27:11,796","00:27:14,416",2.62,276,He is stronger than I am.
1,5,"00:27:11,796","00:27:14,416",2.62,277,I could have gotten badly hurt.
1,5,"00:27:19,721","00:27:21,471",1.75,278,The rain has soaked my clothes.
1,5,"00:27:43,536","00:27:44,696",1.16,279,He has mastered Chisu.
1,5,"00:27:45,497","00:27:47,417",1.92,280,He dried his clothes so easily.
1,5,"00:27:47,499","00:27:50,129",2.63,281,He is a master of the higher levels of Chisu.
1,5,"00:27:56,925","00:27:58,545",1.62,282,A master of levels beyond Chisu?
1,5,"00:27:59,844","00:28:01,304",1.46,283,I could have died.
1,5,"00:28:04,933","00:28:06,483",1.55,284,It is nice and dry.
1,5,"00:28:15,485","00:28:16,815",1.33,285,Do not drink that tea.
1,5,"00:28:21,574","00:28:23,084",1.51,286,You drank the entire pot?
1,5,"00:28:23,159","00:28:24,159",1.00,287,Yes.
1,5,"00:28:24,244","00:28:26,334",2.09,288,Are you all right? Do you feel unwell?
1,5,"00:28:28,957","00:28:29,997",1.04,289,Did you brew poisonous herbs?
1,5,"00:28:30,917","00:28:32,287",1.37,290,"No, not poisonous herbs."
1,5,"00:28:32,377","00:28:33,667",1.29,291,Chaste herbs.
1,5,"00:28:33,753","00:28:35,003",1.25,292,Chaste?
1,5,"00:28:35,088","00:28:36,338",1.25,293,Chaste herbs?
1,5,"00:28:36,923","00:28:39,973",3.05,294,You mentioned picking herbs that grow only in Danhyanggok.
1,5,"00:28:40,051","00:28:41,391",1.34,295,Did you mean chaste herbs?
1,5,"00:28:43,680","00:28:45,520",1.84,296,You know about chaste herbs?
1,5,"00:28:45,598","00:28:51,983",6.38,297,I heard that there were mages who drink tea made with chaste herbs to lower their libido so they could focus on mastering their spells.
1,5,"00:28:53,398","00:28:55,068",1.67,298,Lower their libido? What is that?
1,5,"00:28:55,900","00:28:58,700",2.80,299,"Your sexual desire, one of the five desires of humans."
1,5,"00:28:58,778","00:29:00,278",1.50,300,What? Sexual desire?
1,5,"00:29:02,991","00:29:09,788",6.80,301,Chaste herbs cut off… the energy that causes humans to have sexual desires.
1,5,"00:29:12,000","00:29:17,508",5.51,302,I heard about a mage who reached a high level of sorcery by cutting off his libido and mastering spells.
1,5,"00:29:17,589","00:29:24,052",6.46,303,"They say he only wears clothes made with hemp fabric, which is why they call him, ""Hemp Master Lee."""
1,5,"00:29:24,137","00:29:27,847",3.71,304,You really do know a lot of things for a mere maid.
1,5,"00:29:30,477","00:29:33,687",3.21,305,I am honored to have met a mage who has reached such a high level.
1,5,"00:29:34,230","00:29:36,190",1.96,306,"Here is a proper greeting, Hemp Master Lee."
1,5,"00:29:44,824","00:29:45,784",0.96,307,Young Master.
1,5,"00:29:45,867","00:29:47,787",1.92,308,What are you doing? Greet him properly.
1,5,"00:29:50,914","00:29:54,214",3.30,309,Does this mean my libido has been cut off?
1,5,"00:29:55,585","00:29:56,705",1.12,310,No…
1,5,"00:29:56,795","00:29:57,795",1.00,311,No way.
1,5,"00:29:57,879","00:29:59,419",1.54,312,No…
1,5,"00:30:00,131","00:30:02,051",1.92,313,That cannot happen. Please help me.
1,5,"00:30:02,884","00:30:05,644",2.76,314,A single pot of tea is not enough to cut off your libido.
1,5,"00:30:05,720","00:30:07,560",1.84,315,Are you sure? Tell me the truth!
1,5,"00:30:07,639","00:30:09,639",2.00,316,"Yes, it is the truth."
1,5,"00:30:07,639","00:30:12,194",4.56,317,"If you are so worried, I will make you a tonic to help boost it back."
1,5,"00:30:14,145","00:30:16,765",2.62,318,Thank you.
1,5,"00:30:16,856","00:30:17,856",1.00,319,Master Lee.
1,5,"00:30:17,941","00:30:20,691",2.75,320,Can you help my young master?
1,5,"00:30:20,777","00:30:25,157",4.38,321,He is struggling to control the energy that is focused on his right arm.
1,5,"00:30:25,240","00:30:29,160",3.92,322,Can you help him control it?
1,5,"00:30:29,244","00:30:33,955",4.71,323,"Teaching him would not be hard, but if you wish to learn from me, you must do as I say."
1,5,"00:30:34,040","00:30:35,250",1.21,324,Are you ready for that?
1,5,"00:30:35,333","00:30:36,753",1.42,325,He is ready to do anything.
1,5,"00:30:36,835","00:30:37,745",0.91,326,Right?
1,5,"00:30:40,296","00:30:43,046",2.75,327,What exactly do I need to do?
1,5,"00:30:43,132","00:30:46,471",3.34,328,"Just like me, you must drink chaste herb tea."
1,5,"00:30:47,762","00:30:53,941",6.18,329,Are you willing to cut off… your libido?
1,5,"00:30:58,523","00:31:00,153",1.63,330,You drank the whole pot?
1,5,"00:31:00,650","00:31:01,650",1.00,331,Yes.
1,5,"00:31:02,610","00:31:03,820",1.21,332,"You can do it, right?"
1,5,"00:31:15,748","00:31:17,998",2.25,333,So what if he is a renowned mage?
1,5,"00:31:18,084","00:31:21,804",3.72,334,He is stuck here all by himself without a pupil for a good reason.
1,5,"00:31:22,630","00:31:24,880",2.25,335,His method will speed things up.
1,5,"00:31:25,383","00:31:28,143",2.76,336,You will quickly be able to control that energy in your arm.
1,5,"00:31:28,219","00:31:31,809",3.59,337,Listen. He wants me to drink that chaste herb tea. That is ridiculous.
1,5,"00:31:31,890","00:31:36,350",4.46,338,I am already bothered by how much I drank yesterday.
1,5,"00:31:36,436","00:31:38,856",2.42,339,I wonder if this tonic will be enough to undo it.
1,5,"00:31:38,938","00:31:40,768",1.83,340,It is not entirely ridiculous.
1,5,"00:31:41,900","00:31:47,323",5.42,341,Cutting off your libido is not a bad idea if you will not be needing it for a while.
1,5,"00:31:43,943","00:31:47,323",3.38,342,It is a good way to train.
1,5,"00:31:51,409","00:31:54,699",3.29,343,Are you saying I will not be needing it for a while?
1,5,"00:31:56,664","00:31:58,674",2.01,344,"Mu-deok, look me in the eye and tell me."
1,5,"00:31:58,750","00:32:00,250",1.50,345,Yes! Is that a problem?
1,5,"00:32:00,335","00:32:02,295",1.96,346,Think about it.
1,5,"00:32:00,335","00:32:02,295",1.96,347,This is a rare opportunity.
1,5,"00:32:02,378","00:32:04,588",2.21,348,It takes a lot of luck to meet someone like him.
1,5,"00:32:05,632","00:32:09,301",3.67,349,Just practice celibacy for a while and get rid of this.
1,5,"00:32:09,385","00:32:11,885",2.50,350,Do not make it sound like a walk in the park.
1,5,"00:32:11,971","00:32:14,021",2.05,351,Impotence is a small sacrifice for a high-level mage.
1,5,"00:32:14,098","00:32:15,888",1.79,352,See? Listen to what you just said.
1,5,"00:32:15,975","00:32:18,435",2.46,353,You do not care if my libido will be cut off forever.
1,5,"00:32:18,519","00:32:19,979",1.46,354,Stop fussing over what is useless.
1,5,"00:32:20,063","00:32:22,113",2.05,355,It is precious to me regardless of its use!
1,5,"00:32:33,326","00:32:34,866",1.54,356,Hey…
1,5,"00:32:34,953","00:32:37,663",2.71,357,"Mu-deok, are you all right?"
1,5,"00:32:38,247","00:32:40,287",2.04,358,What just happened?
1,5,"00:32:41,334","00:32:42,254",0.92,359,Ryusu.
1,5,"00:32:44,545","00:32:46,965",2.42,360,The energy within you has trickled out.
1,5,"00:32:48,466","00:32:50,886",2.42,361,A small amount of energy created immense strength.
1,5,"00:32:51,469","00:32:56,387",4.92,362,"If you took off the binding bracelet and used your full force, I would have died on the spot."
1,5,"00:33:00,144","00:33:01,604",1.46,363,"Hey, you are bleeding."
1,5,"00:33:04,023","00:33:06,033",2.01,364,"Master, you must be crazy."
1,5,"00:33:06,109","00:33:08,109",2.00,365,Do you enjoy almost dying?
1,5,"00:33:06,109","00:33:08,109",2.00,366,Yes.
1,5,"00:33:08,194","00:33:11,114",2.92,367,It means you are getting stronger.
1,5,"00:33:14,701","00:33:25,546",10.85,368,"Right now, it may seem insignificant, but your energy will soon add up, and your power will be as awe-inspiring as Lake Gyeongcheondaeho."
1,5,"00:33:27,672","00:33:30,092",2.42,369,Then I will also be able to regain my power.
1,5,"00:33:43,980","00:33:47,070",3.09,370,Wipe that blood off before it fills up Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.
1,5,"00:33:50,486","00:33:51,316",0.83,371,It must hurt.
1,5,"00:33:51,404","00:33:53,034",1.63,372,Not at all.
1,5,"00:33:53,114","00:33:54,624",1.51,373,Stop acting tough.
1,5,"00:33:59,495","00:34:01,405",1.91,374,Year one of the King Go Sun regime.
1,5,"00:34:01,497","00:34:03,877",2.38,375,The first day of April.
1,5,"00:34:10,423","00:34:11,763",1.34,376,"GO SUN, YEAR ONE FIRST DAY OF APRIL"
1,5,"00:34:11,841","00:34:15,301",3.46,377,The King's Star was in the night sky the night the baby was born.
1,5,"00:34:15,386","00:34:18,006",2.62,378,No one can find out about that star.
1,5,"00:34:18,097","00:34:20,597",2.50,379,But Cheonbugwan would have kept a record of it.
1,5,"00:34:20,683","00:34:23,023",2.34,380,I have managed to sneak out the actual plate.
1,5,"00:34:23,102","00:34:27,193",4.09,381,The one in Cheonbugwan is… a fake one without the King's Star.
1,5,"00:34:28,816","00:34:33,026",4.21,382,You must not let anyone find out the secret behind his birth.
1,5,"00:34:37,658","00:34:40,238",2.58,383,Do you see a strange constellation there?
1,5,"00:34:49,128","00:34:53,218",4.09,384,It is the day that Lady Do-hwa died and Jang Uk was born.
1,5,"00:34:55,968","00:34:57,638",1.67,385,I heard about the gathering.
1,5,"00:34:58,596","00:35:03,136",4.54,386,All you noble mages must have had to gather because of me.
1,5,"00:35:05,937","00:35:07,227",1.29,387,Assistant Gwanju.
1,5,"00:35:08,022","00:35:09,862",1.84,388,Why not start your own family line?
1,5,"00:35:10,900","00:35:18,368",7.47,389,"If you receive a unanimous vote, you can also become a noble member of the Unanimous Society yourself."
1,5,"00:35:21,077","00:35:24,497",3.42,390,I am a member of the Jin family.
1,5,"00:35:21,077","00:35:24,497",3.42,391,Jinyowon is my birthplace.
1,5,"00:35:27,542","00:35:29,422",1.88,392,What brings you to Cheonbugwan?
1,5,"00:35:29,502","00:35:33,297",3.80,393,The soul shifter found in Songrim was a constellation recorder mage in Cheonbugwan.
1,5,"00:35:34,048","00:35:38,386",4.34,394,"The Jeongjingak mages must carry out an investigation, so please cooperate."
1,5,"00:35:39,095","00:35:41,055",1.96,395,Investigate what?
1,5,"00:35:45,810","00:35:49,730",3.92,396,Why do you want to know?
1,5,"00:35:45,810","00:35:49,730",3.92,397,So you can hide things in advance?
1,5,"00:35:52,775","00:35:55,315",2.54,398,I have nothing to hide.
1,5,"00:35:55,403","00:35:57,283",1.88,399,They are welcome anytime.
1,5,"00:35:58,656","00:36:01,366",2.71,400,They are already here.
1,5,"00:36:25,850","00:36:30,687",4.84,401,That mage's job was to continuously maintain the right amount of energy in here.
1,5,"00:36:31,731","00:36:34,401",2.67,402,He was in charge of this section.
1,5,"00:36:43,159","00:36:46,369",3.21,403,What? There is a dead body in Cheonbugwan?
1,5,"00:36:46,454","00:36:49,674",3.22,404,"Eunuch Kim absorbed a man's energy, and the body is in the secret room."
1,5,"00:37:04,430","00:37:06,810",2.38,405,The soul shifter's job here was nothing important.
1,5,"00:37:06,891","00:37:09,981",3.09,406,He was also warned for secretly looking at the constellation plates.
1,5,"00:37:13,356","00:37:14,396",1.04,407,My lord.
1,5,"00:37:15,483","00:37:18,863",3.38,408,A lot of the officials seem to have suddenly disappeared.
1,5,"00:37:18,945","00:37:20,315",1.37,409,Where could they have gone?
1,5,"00:37:27,078","00:37:28,698",1.62,410,Thank you for your cooperation.
1,5,"00:37:29,372","00:37:30,792",1.42,411,Do not mention it.
1,5,"00:37:30,873","00:37:33,133",2.26,412,I have one more favor to ask.
1,5,"00:37:34,001","00:37:39,970",5.97,413,"This may be out of line, but I would like to take a look at the secret room inside Cheonbugwan."
1,5,"00:37:57,733","00:37:59,613",1.88,414,Feel free to look around.
1,5,"00:38:25,970","00:38:28,680",2.71,415,Use the underground tunnel to take the corpse out.
1,5,"00:38:40,901","00:38:43,821",2.92,416,"If they are hiding something, they will try to get rid of it."
1,5,"00:38:44,655","00:38:46,275",1.62,417,Watch and follow his men.
1,5,"00:38:50,369","00:38:51,579",1.21,418,Let us hurry.
1,5,"00:39:04,967","00:39:06,887",1.92,419,We saw this wagon exiting Cheonbugwan.
1,5,"00:39:06,969","00:39:08,759",1.79,420,Are you a mage there?
1,5,"00:39:08,846","00:39:09,966",1.12,421,Show us your face.
1,5,"00:39:10,056","00:39:11,266",1.21,422,Let us see what is inside.
1,5,"00:39:54,892","00:39:55,812",0.92,423,Go after him!
1,5,"00:40:43,899","00:40:45,439",1.54,424,The man I fought just ran away.
1,5,"00:40:46,819","00:40:48,359",1.54,425,Did you lose the wagoner?
1,5,"00:40:50,573","00:40:51,873",1.30,426,I found this inside.
1,5,"00:40:52,491","00:40:53,951",1.46,427,That is Songrim's Spirit Plaque.
1,5,"00:40:54,827","00:40:56,907",2.08,428,Were those men from Songrim?
1,5,"00:41:12,386","00:41:17,771",5.39,429,"The Spirit Plaque of Songrim was found inside the wagon, so they will not be able to raise an issue."
1,5,"00:41:18,767","00:41:21,347",2.58,430,Naksu ended up helping us even after she died.
1,5,"00:41:24,857","00:41:27,897",3.04,431,"I apologize for the trouble I have caused, Assistant Gwanju."
1,5,"00:41:32,615","00:41:35,445",2.83,432,You attacked a person in the middle of the street?
1,5,"00:41:35,534","00:41:39,834",4.30,433,"I shifted your good-for-nothing soul into a man of power, but it was not so you could act out."
1,5,"00:41:39,914","00:41:41,084",1.17,434,Forgive me.
1,5,"00:41:49,757","00:41:51,837",2.08,435,Deliver this chest.
1,5,"00:41:55,012","00:41:57,182",2.17,436,Make sure they receive it as always.
1,5,"00:41:57,264","00:42:00,524",3.26,437,I will make sure it is delivered right away.
1,5,"00:42:11,195","00:42:13,105",1.91,438,He will have to be discarded soon.
1,5,"00:42:13,197","00:42:14,907",1.71,439,Find me another eunuch.
1,5,"00:42:14,990","00:42:19,080",4.09,440,Then I will shift your soul into his body.
1,5,"00:42:22,081","00:42:23,751",1.67,441,Into the body of a eunuch?
1,5,"00:42:24,667","00:42:27,417",2.75,442,What is the matter?
1,5,"00:42:24,667","00:42:27,417",2.75,443,Is it not to your liking?
1,5,"00:42:30,256","00:42:32,546",2.29,444,I shall follow your orders.
1,5,"00:42:32,633","00:42:35,723",3.09,445,Do you still safely carry around the Soul Ejector?
1,5,"00:42:35,803","00:42:36,723",0.92,446,Yes.
1,5,"00:42:45,354","00:42:48,774",3.42,447,I was going to refrain from shifting souls because of Songrim's vigilance.
1,5,"00:42:50,526","00:42:54,696",4.17,448,But it seems to be the only way to serve Her Majesty.
1,5,"00:43:00,411","00:43:05,962",5.55,449,An item that belongs to Songrim was found in a suspicious wagon that was coming out of Cheonbugwan.
1,5,"00:43:06,041","00:43:08,921",2.88,450,So it gives us no right to raise an issue about it.
1,5,"00:43:09,003","00:43:11,883",2.88,451,Find out whose Spirit Plaque this is.
1,5,"00:43:12,464","00:43:16,434",3.97,452,"As you all know, Uk recently lost his Spirit Plaque."
1,5,"00:43:17,011","00:43:20,431",3.42,453,"And judging by that burn mark, I think it belongs to him."
1,5,"00:43:21,807","00:43:23,097",1.29,454,This is Uk's?
1,5,"00:43:23,183","00:43:27,313",4.13,455,I cannot believe him. He does not fail to cause trouble even when he is not here.
1,5,"00:43:27,396","00:43:33,151",5.75,456,I want you two to visit Uk and ask him where and how he lost this Spirit Plaque.
1,5,"00:43:33,986","00:43:35,276",1.29,457,"Yes, my lord."
1,5,"00:43:33,986","00:43:35,276",1.29,458,"Yes, my lord."
1,5,"00:44:16,111","00:44:18,411",2.30,459,"This is from Jin Mu, the Assistant Gwanju."
1,5,"00:44:28,374","00:44:31,504",3.13,460,What is it that the Assistant Gwanju always sends to you?
1,5,"00:44:32,252","00:44:35,552",3.30,461,He sends me medicinal herbs for the sake of my good health.
1,5,"00:44:38,550","00:44:40,840",2.29,462,"He may not look it, but he is a thoughtful man."
1,5,"00:44:55,818","00:44:56,738",0.92,463,Mu-deok.
1,5,"00:44:56,819","00:44:59,409",2.59,464,I am going to go with Master Lee to pick medicinal herbs.
1,5,"00:44:59,488","00:45:00,528",1.04,465,When will you train?
1,5,"00:45:00,614","00:45:03,534",2.92,466,I should earn my keep to stay here.
1,5,"00:45:00,614","00:45:03,534",2.92,467,I will see you later.
1,5,"00:45:03,617","00:45:04,987",1.37,468,Let us get going.
1,5,"00:45:03,617","00:45:04,987",1.37,469,Right.
1,5,"00:45:06,078","00:45:07,658",1.58,470,Does it really have a great view?
1,5,"00:45:07,746","00:45:10,536",2.79,471,The view is magnificent.
1,5,"00:45:07,746","00:45:10,536",2.79,472,I cannot wait to see it.
1,5,"00:45:15,879","00:45:18,259",2.38,473,"Master Lee, you are very dexterous."
1,5,"00:45:18,340","00:45:21,140",2.80,474,I buy everything and just put them together. Hold it.
1,5,"00:45:21,218","00:45:22,258",1.04,475,Like this?
1,5,"00:45:21,218","00:45:22,258",1.04,476,Yes.
1,5,"00:45:26,598","00:45:27,768",1.17,477,This is nice.
1,5,"00:45:30,352","00:45:33,062",2.71,478,"Today, we will go to a place with tons of mandarin fish."
1,5,"00:45:33,147","00:45:36,397",3.25,479,Mandarin fish? Then we should prepare ingredients for the fish stew.
1,5,"00:45:36,483","00:45:37,823",1.34,480,Do you know how to cook it?
1,5,"00:45:37,901","00:45:39,861",1.96,481,"No, but you can teach me how."
1,5,"00:45:40,779","00:45:42,609",1.83,482,"Why, you…"
1,5,"00:45:53,834","00:45:54,964",1.13,483,It is a bit salty.
1,5,"00:45:57,671","00:45:59,341",1.67,484,"Mu-deok, have a taste."
1,5,"00:45:59,923","00:46:02,803",2.88,485,"Young Master, are you here to mess around?"
1,5,"00:46:02,885","00:46:04,635",1.75,486,What are you doing?
1,5,"00:46:05,429","00:46:07,599",2.17,487,Master Lee has a lot to teach.
1,5,"00:46:07,681","00:46:09,101",1.42,488,Who told you to learn things like this?
1,5,"00:46:09,183","00:46:11,193",2.01,489,"If you wish to learn from him, do it right."
1,5,"00:46:12,019","00:46:14,559",2.54,490,"Mu-deok, I think I am fit to live in the wild."
1,5,"00:46:14,646","00:46:17,936",3.29,491,Thank you for bringing me to such a peaceful place.
1,5,"00:46:20,527","00:46:25,912",5.38,492,Are not even worried… about the duel with the Crown Prince?
1,5,"00:46:27,326","00:46:29,366",2.04,493,"If you are so worried, go find out."
1,5,"00:46:31,330","00:46:32,290",0.96,494,It is salty.
1,5,"00:46:35,459","00:46:36,379",0.92,495,Hey!
1,5,"00:46:38,253","00:46:39,253",1.00,496,My gosh!
1,5,"00:46:48,263","00:46:49,473",1.21,497,"Mu-deok, put down that knife."
1,5,"00:46:50,432","00:46:52,352",1.92,498,You better not throw it at me.
1,5,"00:46:52,935","00:46:55,055",2.12,499,I said I would kill you if you become useless.
1,5,"00:46:56,188","00:46:57,268",1.08,500,You cannot kill me.
1,5,"00:46:57,356","00:46:59,526",2.17,501,"I have mastered Jipsu, and you are just Mu-deok."
1,5,"00:47:01,443","00:47:03,153",1.71,502,You are no longer Naksu.
1,5,"00:47:05,822","00:47:07,492",1.67,503,Hey! That is dangerous!
1,5,"00:47:08,200","00:47:11,040",2.84,504,You and I have no need for peace and serenity in our lives.
1,5,"00:47:11,119","00:47:12,329",1.21,505,I will destroy it for you.
1,5,"00:47:18,835","00:47:20,205",1.37,506,What is the matter with you?
1,5,"00:47:20,295","00:47:22,415",2.12,507,Who are you to stop me from enjoying my peace?
1,5,"00:47:22,506","00:47:24,376",1.87,508,Are you satisfied with this life?
1,5,"00:47:25,634","00:47:26,514",0.88,509,"Yes, I am."
1,5,"00:47:26,593","00:47:29,513",2.92,510,I am very satisfied.
1,5,"00:47:26,593","00:47:29,513",2.92,511,"If you do not like it, then you can leave."
1,5,"00:47:29,596","00:47:34,558",4.96,512,"I am happy with my life here, but if you do not feel the same way, you may leave."
1,5,"00:47:36,895","00:47:38,225",1.33,513,You jerk.
1,5,"00:47:39,273","00:47:41,443",2.17,514,You know we are both connected by fate.
1,5,"00:47:41,984","00:47:44,244",2.26,515,And you are asking me to be the one to end it.
1,5,"00:47:46,071","00:47:47,361",1.29,516,You coward.
1,5,"00:47:54,454","00:47:55,964",1.51,517,Damn it.
1,5,"00:48:18,604","00:48:24,190",5.59,518,I have found a way for Uk to avoid a duel with the Crown Prince and still become Cheonbugwan's Gwanju.
1,5,"00:48:25,193","00:48:27,903",2.71,519,What is it? We are ready to do anything.
1,5,"00:48:29,281","00:48:33,541",4.26,520,"By having Uk marry my daughter, Cho-yeon."
1,5,"00:48:41,293","00:48:45,667",4.37,521,Our family owns a plaque that gives us the power to reject the King's orders.
1,5,"00:48:50,761","00:48:56,770",6.01,522,We even have the power to dethrone the King if all the mages in Daeho unanimously vote for it.
1,5,"00:48:57,726","00:49:06,187",8.46,523,This plaque was granted to us by the Unanimous Assembly to prevent the rare and dangerous spirits inside Jinyowon from escaping.
1,5,"00:49:06,777","00:49:13,454",6.68,524,Are you offering to go against His Majesty's order to deprive Uk of becoming the next Gwanju?
1,5,"00:49:13,533","00:49:18,500",4.97,525,"Yes, but only if he marries my daughter and becomes a member of the Jin family."
1,5,"00:49:22,292","00:49:30,010",7.72,526,But Lady Jin and Young Master Jang have already once called off their engagement.
1,5,"00:49:27,130","00:49:30,010",2.88,527,Are you all right with that?
1,5,"00:49:31,426","00:49:33,636",2.21,528,It was not because my feelings for him had faded.
1,5,"00:49:34,304","00:49:36,724",2.42,529,I still wish to marry Uk.
1,5,"00:49:41,103","00:49:43,443",2.34,530,I did not expect him to wed so soon.
1,5,"00:49:43,522","00:49:45,612",2.09,531,I am not sure if he is ready to get married.
1,5,"00:49:55,367","00:49:58,287",2.92,532,You do things pretty well for someone from a wealthy family.
1,5,"00:49:58,370","00:50:01,500",3.13,533,"Once I put my mind to something, I tend to learn very fast."
1,5,"00:50:01,581","00:50:02,791",1.21,534,I like you even more now.
1,5,"00:50:04,459","00:50:07,089",2.63,535,You should reconsider becoming my pupil.
1,5,"00:50:08,088","00:50:11,128",3.04,536,"Master Lee, do you not have any pupils?"
1,5,"00:50:12,843","00:50:16,678",3.84,537,"I had one, but he gave up on celibacy and got married."
1,5,"00:50:18,640","00:50:20,560",1.92,538,He works at an infirmary now.
1,5,"00:50:28,233","00:50:30,573",2.34,539,You can always change your mind and go back.
1,5,"00:50:30,652","00:50:31,782",1.13,540,So think about it.
1,5,"00:50:33,655","00:50:35,905",2.25,541,I did not come here to train.
1,5,"00:50:35,991","00:50:40,538",4.55,542,Do you really want to waste that energy on just fishing and picking medicinal herbs?
1,5,"00:50:45,792","00:50:48,752",2.96,543,I cannot control it anyway.
1,5,"00:50:45,792","00:50:48,752",2.96,544,Is that so?
1,5,"00:50:49,421","00:50:51,921",2.50,545,That arm will become a burden if you leave it like that.
1,5,"00:50:53,592","00:50:55,342",1.75,546,Shall I cut off your energy flow?
1,5,"00:50:57,304","00:51:00,394",3.09,547,Then you will be able to live an average and comfortable life.
1,5,"00:51:15,405","00:51:18,155",2.75,548,I need to go to the fortress.
1,5,"00:51:15,405","00:51:18,155",2.75,549,Would you like to come with me?
1,5,"00:51:18,241","00:51:21,161",2.92,550,"No, I will pass today."
1,5,"00:51:18,241","00:51:21,161",2.92,551,I need to cook for Mu-deok.
1,5,"00:51:22,370","00:51:25,420",3.05,552,She is not here.
1,5,"00:51:22,370","00:51:25,420",3.05,553,She went down the mountain earlier.
1,5,"00:51:26,625","00:51:27,745",1.12,554,What?
1,5,"00:51:27,834","00:51:33,054",5.22,555,Jang Uk is a real genius and has already mastered Ryusu.
1,5,"00:51:33,131","00:51:35,721",2.59,556,And he is training hard to get ready for the duel.
1,5,"00:51:37,844","00:51:40,264",2.42,557,"Spread that rumor around the city, word-for-word."
1,5,"00:51:40,347","00:51:41,387",1.04,558,Really?
1,5,"00:51:42,098","00:51:44,848",2.75,559,"If he still does not show up, he will completely lose face."
1,5,"00:51:45,894","00:51:49,024",3.13,560,Then at least he will feel humiliated.
1,5,"00:51:49,731","00:51:50,981",1.25,561,Give me some chicken.
1,5,"00:51:51,066","00:51:53,646",2.58,562,You should leave today.
1,5,"00:51:51,066","00:51:53,646",2.58,563,Cheonbugwan officials are here.
1,5,"00:51:53,735","00:51:55,695",1.96,564,Someone high-up came to visit us today.
1,5,"00:51:56,780","00:52:00,123",3.34,565,"It is best not to run into them, especially with the Spirit Plaque incident."
1,5,"00:52:21,096","00:52:21,966",0.87,566,Stop right there.
1,5,"00:52:27,143","00:52:29,403",2.26,567,"You are Jang Uk's maid, are you not?"
1,5,"00:52:30,480","00:52:32,270",1.79,568,"Yes, I am. Do you need something?"
1,5,"00:52:33,066","00:52:36,486",3.42,569,There is no way Naksu would have shifted her soul into a body like that.
1,5,"00:52:37,654","00:52:38,704",1.05,570,You…
1,5,"00:52:39,364","00:52:42,744",3.38,571,Do you remember seeing me at the inn by the dock?
1,5,"00:52:52,752","00:52:54,552",1.80,572,I am not sure.
1,5,"00:52:58,675","00:52:59,965",1.29,573,He is suspicious of me.
1,5,"00:53:01,094","00:53:04,064",2.97,574,I have a few questions for you.
1,5,"00:53:01,094","00:53:04,064",2.97,575,Come with me to Cheonbugwan.
1,5,"00:53:07,475","00:53:08,515",1.04,576,Follow me.
1,5,"00:53:08,602","00:53:10,692",2.09,577,Get off me!
1,5,"00:53:08,602","00:53:10,692",2.09,578,Stay still!
1,5,"00:53:10,770","00:53:12,190",1.42,579,Why are you…
1,5,"00:53:10,770","00:53:12,190",1.42,580,Stay still!
1,5,"00:53:14,608","00:53:15,728",1.12,581,She has no blue mark.
1,5,"00:53:17,277","00:53:19,147",1.87,582,Is she really not Naksu?
1,5,"00:53:21,072","00:53:24,282",3.21,583,I do not know where Young Master Jang is.
1,5,"00:53:27,829","00:53:29,039",1.21,584,Your Royal Highness!
1,5,"00:53:32,918","00:53:34,128",1.21,585,Your Royal Highness.
1,5,"00:53:35,253","00:53:36,923",1.67,586,"Your Royal Highness, it is me."
1,5,"00:53:37,005","00:53:38,375",1.37,587,"It is me, Filthy Mu-deok."
1,5,"00:53:51,019","00:53:52,439",1.42,588,You are Filthy Mu-deok.
1,5,"00:53:52,520","00:53:55,940",3.42,589,"Yes, that is me. You granted me that name."
1,5,"00:53:56,024","00:53:57,574",1.55,590,I am Filthy Mu-deok.
1,5,"00:53:59,778","00:54:02,658",2.88,591,"Your Royal Highness, please help me."
1,5,"00:54:02,739","00:54:03,869",1.13,592,Help you with what?
1,5,"00:54:04,449","00:54:07,579",3.13,593,"Your Royal Highness, you are not only intelligent but also strong."
1,5,"00:54:07,661","00:54:09,911",2.25,594,"Meanwhile, my young master is dumb and pathetic."
1,5,"00:54:09,996","00:54:11,786",1.79,595,"Because of him, my life is at stake."
1,5,"00:54:11,873","00:54:13,633",1.76,596,"Please help me, Your Royal Highness."
1,5,"00:54:20,131","00:54:22,681",2.55,597,"Thank you very much, Your Royal Highness."
1,5,"00:54:24,761","00:54:27,601",2.84,598,"What is your dumb, pathetic young master up to these days?"
1,5,"00:54:27,681","00:54:29,891",2.21,599,He spends every day crying.
1,5,"00:54:29,975","00:54:34,853",4.88,600,"He is terrified of you, so he shakes in fear and weeps in hiding."
1,5,"00:54:35,647","00:54:38,527",2.88,601,I see you are speaking ill of him just so you can please me.
1,5,"00:54:39,442","00:54:42,952",3.51,602,I can say things that are a lot worse if it pleases you.
1,5,"00:54:44,114","00:54:47,704",3.59,603,"Filthy Mu-deok, you must think I am a petty man."
1,5,"00:54:48,284","00:54:50,204",1.92,604,I am filthy for a reason.
1,5,"00:54:50,787","00:54:55,915",5.13,605,"Relieve yourself of everything you have wanted to say but could not, thinking it might make you seem petty."
1,5,"00:54:57,085","00:54:59,375",2.29,606,Are you offering to be a verbal outhouse of sorts?
1,5,"00:54:59,462","00:55:02,222",2.76,607,"Goodness, that would be too grand of a title for me."
1,5,"00:55:02,298","00:55:04,088",1.79,608,But I would be more than honored.
1,5,"00:55:06,177","00:55:08,507",2.33,609,I do not need someone like you to relieve my stress.
1,5,"00:55:10,181","00:55:16,688",6.51,610,"Your Royal Highness, I know you have done enough, but can you please tell those men not to drag me away again?"
1,5,"00:55:17,355","00:55:18,815",1.46,611,A warning will be enough.
1,5,"00:55:26,740","00:55:28,070",1.33,612,Take this.
1,5,"00:55:29,534","00:55:30,744",1.21,613,That is my sachet.
1,5,"00:55:30,827","00:55:31,997",1.17,614,SACHET: A SCENTED BAG
1,5,"00:55:32,078","00:55:35,368",3.29,615,Show them that if your pathetic master puts you in trouble again.
1,5,"00:55:36,332","00:55:38,712",2.38,616,My goodness.
1,5,"00:55:36,332","00:55:38,712",2.38,617,"Thank you, Your Royal Highness."
1,5,"00:55:44,674","00:55:46,514",1.84,618,It smells of cinnamon.
1,5,"00:55:46,593","00:55:48,393",1.80,619,Why do you look disgusted by the smell?
1,5,"00:55:48,470","00:55:50,560",2.09,620,What is the matter? Do you not like it?
1,5,"00:55:50,638","00:55:53,178",2.54,621,Nonsense. I really like it.
1,5,"00:55:53,892","00:55:55,392",1.50,622,Give it back then.
1,5,"00:55:53,892","00:55:55,392",1.50,623,No.
1,5,"00:55:55,477","00:55:57,517",2.04,624,It is already covered in my filth.
1,5,"00:55:58,855","00:56:01,565",2.71,625,I am grateful for this wonderful-smelling gift.
1,5,"00:56:03,485","00:56:06,605",3.12,626,Then let me pour you a glass of alcohol that also smells wonderful.
1,5,"00:56:16,873","00:56:19,674",2.80,627,"It is cinnamon and ginger wine, made with plenty of cinnamon."
1,5,"00:56:21,753","00:56:24,263",2.51,628,You must not like the smell.
1,5,"00:56:21,753","00:56:24,263",2.51,629,I will take it back.
1,5,"00:56:24,881","00:56:25,881",1.00,630,No.
1,5,"00:56:25,965","00:56:27,175",1.21,631,I like it.
1,5,"00:56:37,268","00:56:39,558",2.29,632,How does it taste?
1,5,"00:56:37,268","00:56:39,558",2.29,633,It tastes wonderful.
1,5,"00:56:39,646","00:56:40,606",0.96,634,Have another glass.
1,5,"00:56:48,696","00:56:51,566",2.87,635,Mu-deok probably went to Chwiseonru.
1,5,"00:56:48,696","00:56:51,566",2.87,636,She has nowhere else to go.
1,5,"00:56:52,117","00:56:53,867",1.75,637,Did she get angry and leave?
1,5,"00:56:54,953","00:56:56,543",1.59,638,What kind of maid is that?
1,5,"00:56:57,205","00:56:58,825",1.62,639,She is no ordinary maid.
1,5,"00:56:59,457","00:57:02,787",3.33,640,"If she is no ordinary maid, then what exactly is she?"
1,5,"00:57:03,711","00:57:06,131",2.42,641,Mu-deok is like a bird's egg.
1,5,"00:57:06,214","00:57:07,844",1.63,642,She needs to be embraced.
1,5,"00:57:08,842","00:57:11,432",2.59,643,Let us go and look.
1,5,"00:57:08,842","00:57:11,432",2.59,644,What is it?
1,5,"00:57:11,511","00:57:13,641",2.13,645,They found the corpse of a soul shifter.
1,5,"00:57:13,721","00:57:15,521",1.80,646,A soul shifter's corpse?
1,5,"00:57:13,721","00:57:15,521",1.80,647,Where?
1,5,"00:57:18,476","00:57:21,266",2.79,648,Let me see.
1,5,"00:57:18,476","00:57:21,266",2.79,649,What happened?
1,5,"00:57:21,354","00:57:23,154",1.80,650,My goodness.
1,5,"00:57:21,354","00:57:23,154",1.80,651,"Oh, dear."
1,5,"00:57:23,231","00:57:26,071",2.84,652,It looks horrible.
1,5,"00:57:23,231","00:57:26,071",2.84,653,Goodness gracious.
1,5,"00:57:29,988","00:57:31,988",2.00,654,That is not a soul shifter.
1,5,"00:57:32,073","00:57:33,993",1.92,655,But he died because of one.
1,5,"00:57:34,701","00:57:36,201",1.50,656,You know about soul shifters?
1,5,"00:57:36,286","00:57:38,826",2.54,657,"When soul shifters run wild, they feed off the energy of humans."
1,5,"00:57:39,414","00:57:43,838",4.42,658,That is why they banned the alchemy of souls and started capturing and killing soul shifters.
1,5,"00:57:55,388","00:57:57,308",1.92,659,Do all soul shifters run wild?
1,5,"00:57:57,390","00:57:59,640",2.25,660,Not if they master Hwansu.
1,5,"00:58:00,351","00:58:03,521",3.17,661,Is that level even possible for a human being to master?
1,5,"00:58:03,605","00:58:04,805",1.20,662,Of course.
1,5,"00:58:05,690","00:58:08,990",3.30,663,Would you like to be my pupil and reach that level?
1,5,"00:58:09,569","00:58:14,160",4.59,664,"You are not only well-built and smart, but you also have what it takes."
1,5,"00:58:15,074","00:58:18,504",3.43,665,"Thank you for the compliment, but I do not wish to be celibate."
1,5,"00:58:18,578","00:58:22,371",3.79,666,"If you become my pupil, I will teach you how to take off that binding bracelet."
1,5,"00:58:22,957","00:58:24,037",1.08,667,"""Master."""
1,5,"00:58:25,627","00:58:26,457",0.83,668,That is all it takes.
1,5,"00:58:27,378","00:58:29,298",1.92,669,Please stop trying to convince me.
1,5,"00:58:29,881","00:58:32,381",2.50,670,We are from Cheonbugwan.
1,5,"00:58:29,881","00:58:32,381",2.50,671,"Everyone, step away."
1,5,"00:58:34,511","00:58:37,391",2.88,672,I should get going.
1,5,"00:58:34,511","00:58:37,391",2.88,673,It is bad for me to run into them.
1,5,"00:58:39,098","00:58:40,268",1.17,674,Goodness.
1,5,"00:58:52,237","00:58:53,987",1.75,675,Look over there.
1,5,"00:58:54,072","00:58:55,622",1.55,676,It is a rainbow.
1,5,"00:58:54,072","00:58:55,622",1.55,677,Where?
1,5,"00:58:55,698","00:58:58,328",2.63,678,"Oh, my goodness."
1,5,"00:58:55,698","00:58:58,328",2.63,679,It is a rainbow.
1,5,"00:58:58,409","00:59:00,749",2.34,680,It really is a rainbow.
1,5,"00:58:58,409","00:59:00,749",2.34,681,Beautiful.
1,5,"00:59:00,828","00:59:03,918",3.09,682,Look at that.
1,5,"00:59:00,828","00:59:03,918",3.09,683,It has been so long.
1,5,"00:59:05,083","00:59:06,463",1.38,684,How beautiful.
1,5,"00:59:05,083","00:59:06,463",1.38,685,Look.
1,5,"00:59:06,543","00:59:08,843",2.30,686,It really is a rainbow.
1,5,"00:59:06,543","00:59:08,843",2.30,687,Where did the wagon go?
1,5,"00:59:09,837","00:59:11,417",1.58,688,It was right here a minute ago.
1,5,"00:59:11,965","00:59:14,755",2.79,689,Where did it go?
1,5,"00:59:11,965","00:59:14,755",2.79,690,Where is the wagon?
1,5,"00:59:44,289","00:59:46,869",2.58,691,I am surprised to hear my voice echo in Danhyanggok.
1,5,"00:59:48,751","00:59:49,881",1.13,692,Nice.
1,5,"00:59:52,839","00:59:55,929",3.09,693,What? Mu-deok is drunk?
1,5,"00:59:56,009","00:59:58,049",2.04,694,Are you saying she has been drinking here?
1,5,"00:59:58,136","01:00:00,306",2.17,695,She almost got dragged to Cheonbugwan today.
1,5,"01:00:01,264","01:00:04,274",3.01,696,"But fortunately, the Crown Prince saved her."
1,5,"01:00:06,603","01:00:08,063",1.46,697,The Crown Prince?
1,5,"01:00:06,603","01:00:08,063",1.46,698,Yes.
1,5,"01:00:08,146","01:00:09,856",1.71,699,She did a great job of humoring him.
1,5,"01:00:09,939","01:00:11,519",1.58,700,She knows how to flatter too.
1,5,"01:00:11,608","01:00:14,528",2.92,701,She drank every glass of alcohol that he offered to her.
1,5,"01:00:19,741","01:00:20,661",0.92,702,Where is she?
1,5,"01:00:49,479","01:00:51,399",1.92,703,She is completely wasted.
1,5,"01:00:52,523","01:00:54,573",2.05,704,"Mu-deok, are you all right?"
1,5,"01:00:58,154","01:01:01,074",2.92,705,"My pupil, you have come for me."
1,5,"01:01:02,950","01:01:05,450",2.50,706,"Yes, I am here for you, Master."
1,5,"01:01:06,746","01:01:09,496",2.75,707,I have no control over my body.
1,5,"01:01:10,083","01:01:12,173",2.09,708,I am also having trouble keeping my head up.
1,5,"01:01:12,710","01:01:15,840",3.13,709,"This has never happened to me before, no matter how much I drank."
1,5,"01:01:17,548","01:01:19,508",1.96,710,You are no longer a skilled assassin.
1,5,"01:01:20,635","01:01:21,795",1.16,711,You are just Mu-deok.
1,5,"01:01:29,060","01:01:31,650",2.59,712,I cannot even hold my liquor in this body.
1,5,"01:01:52,959","01:01:55,589",2.63,713,I want to give everything up and live a quiet life.
1,5,"01:01:58,423","01:02:00,013",1.59,714,But one thing keeps bothering me.
1,5,"01:02:26,492","01:02:29,082",2.59,715,I thought I fell from somewhere really high up.
1,5,"01:02:30,788","01:02:32,668",1.88,716,But I guess it was not that high.
1,5,"01:02:42,216","01:02:43,626",1.41,717,I think I broke my leg.
1,5,"01:02:44,218","01:02:45,428",1.21,718,Help me.
1,5,"01:02:46,179","01:02:50,019",3.84,719,I saw you using that to summon your bird a few times.
1,5,"01:02:52,435","01:02:53,725",1.29,720,I would also like to try.
1,5,"01:02:53,811","01:02:56,231",2.42,721,Can I have that?
1,5,"01:03:11,662","01:03:13,502",1.84,722,I came to give it back.
1,5,"01:03:45,613","01:03:47,203",1.59,723,Mu-deok!
1,5,"01:03:47,281","01:03:48,451",1.17,724,I saw Mu-deok.
1,5,"01:03:53,746","01:03:55,246",1.50,725,She really is here.
1,5,"01:03:56,332","01:03:57,172",0.84,726,Where is Uk?
1,5,"01:03:57,959","01:03:59,419",1.46,727,I told you not to run.
1,5,"01:04:01,420","01:04:02,760",1.34,728,What is going on?
1,5,"01:04:02,839","01:04:04,049",1.21,729,Why are you here?
1,5,"01:04:04,131","01:04:08,643",4.51,730,"We could not find you at Sari Village, so we came here to look for you just in case."
1,5,"01:04:09,220","01:04:11,310",2.09,731,Ju-wol was right. You really are here.
1,5,"01:04:11,389","01:04:13,809",2.42,732,"Mu-deok, have you been well?"
1,5,"01:04:14,767","01:04:15,937",1.17,733,Yes.
1,5,"01:04:41,502","01:04:44,462",2.96,734,"Look at you, Mu-deok."
1,5,"01:04:41,502","01:04:44,462",2.96,735,You must be really happy to see him.
1,5,"01:04:45,256","01:04:46,836",1.58,736,"Oh, my gosh."
1,5,"01:04:47,842","01:04:48,802",0.96,737,She is drunk.
1,5,"01:04:49,927","01:04:51,547",1.62,738,Did she drink?
1,5,"01:04:51,637","01:04:53,177",1.54,739,Yes.
1,5,"01:04:51,637","01:04:53,177",1.54,740,"Yes, she did."
1,5,"01:04:53,764","01:04:55,104",1.34,741,Help her climb back up.
1,5,"01:04:55,683","01:04:56,683",1.00,742,You can carry her.
1,5,"01:05:06,485","01:05:08,905",2.42,743,Mu-deok used to come to Danhyanggok to pick herbs.
1,5,"01:05:08,988","01:05:12,198",3.21,744,"A man named Master Lee lives here, and he is letting us stay with him."
1,5,"01:05:12,283","01:05:14,663",2.38,745,I cannot believe Mu-deok got drunk all by herself.
1,5,"01:05:14,744","01:05:16,084",1.34,746,She must be enjoying life.
1,5,"01:05:16,746","01:05:18,826",2.08,747,I did not know there was a place like this in Danhyanggok.
1,5,"01:05:19,457","01:05:20,827",1.37,748,You knew about Danhyanggok?
1,5,"01:05:20,917","01:05:23,087",2.17,749,He used to come here often in the past.
1,5,"01:05:23,169","01:05:26,049",2.88,750,He got in trouble for sneaking out all the time.
1,5,"01:05:26,130","01:05:27,210",1.08,751,He did?
1,5,"01:05:27,715","01:05:29,835",2.12,752,He was crazy about birds.
1,5,"01:05:29,926","01:05:32,386",2.46,753,Why would you come here all by yourself?
1,5,"01:05:32,470","01:05:33,970",1.50,754,You even broke your leg here.
1,5,"01:05:36,599","01:05:38,229",1.63,755,Because I missed them.
1,5,"01:05:42,939","01:05:44,859",1.92,756,The broken leg did not bother me.
1,5,"01:05:45,900","01:05:47,740",1.84,757,And I was not scared to get scolded.
1,5,"01:05:51,155","01:05:52,985",1.83,758,I liked them a lot.
1,5,"01:06:08,172","01:06:10,632",2.46,759,He is way too fond of birds.
1,5,"01:06:11,467","01:06:14,257",2.79,760,"By the way, what kind of tea is this?"
1,5,"01:06:14,345","01:06:17,005",2.66,761,It smells really nice.
1,5,"01:06:14,345","01:06:17,005",2.66,762,Did you drink that?
1,5,"01:06:19,433","01:06:21,563",2.13,763,Yes. Why? Is it good for you?
1,5,"01:06:22,561","01:06:23,441",0.88,764,Of course.
1,5,"01:06:23,521","01:06:28,026",4.50,765,It was made with a medicinal herb that can only be found in Danhyanggok.
1,5,"01:06:28,109","01:06:29,189",1.08,766,Really?
1,5,"01:06:29,276","01:06:31,356",2.08,767,"Yul, have some more."
1,5,"01:06:29,276","01:06:31,356",2.08,768,Do not drink…
1,5,"01:06:31,862","01:06:32,912",1.05,769,"Fine, go ahead."
1,5,"01:06:32,989","01:06:35,239",2.25,770,It really smells nice.
1,5,"01:06:32,989","01:06:35,239",2.25,771,"Yes, I know."
1,5,"01:06:37,702","01:06:39,292",1.59,772,That is chaste tea.
1,5,"01:06:40,705","01:06:41,745",1.04,773,What? Chives tea?
1,5,"01:06:41,831","01:06:44,421",2.59,774,You will all lose your…
1,5,"01:06:46,127","01:06:49,047",2.92,775,Is this made with chives?
1,5,"01:06:46,127","01:06:49,047",2.92,776,I am not sure if it was chives.
1,5,"01:06:49,714","01:06:50,764",1.05,777,Well…
1,5,"01:06:50,840","01:06:53,760",2.92,778,It was made with a lot of ingredients. Drink up.
1,5,"01:06:55,553","01:06:56,553",1.00,779,This is nice.
1,5,"01:07:00,266","01:07:01,766",1.50,780,Enjoy.
1,5,"01:07:32,965","01:07:35,175",2.21,781,A group of suspicious men had my Spirit Plaque?
1,5,"01:07:35,760","01:07:36,640",0.88,782,Yes.
1,5,"01:07:36,719","01:07:38,639",1.92,783,Did you really lose your Spirit Plaque?
1,5,"01:07:38,721","01:07:41,061",2.34,784,"Did someone steal it from you, or did you lend it?"
1,5,"01:07:41,140","01:07:43,350",2.21,785,"No, I lost it."
1,5,"01:07:43,434","01:07:45,984",2.55,786,Do you remember when and where you lost it?
1,5,"01:07:47,813","01:07:48,653",0.84,787,No.
1,5,"01:07:48,731","01:07:51,231",2.50,788,We found it while investigating the soul shifter's case.
1,5,"01:07:51,317","01:07:53,147",1.83,789,This is very important and dangerous.
1,5,"01:08:01,160","01:08:04,540",3.38,790,The marriage of Jin Cho-yeon and Jang Uk?
1,5,"01:08:05,122","01:08:07,672",2.55,791,That is a magnificent idea.
1,5,"01:08:07,750","01:08:11,960",4.21,792,"But when two people get married, they should love each other."
1,5,"01:08:12,046","01:08:15,756",3.71,793,"He cannot marry someone he does not love, just to resolve an urgent matter."
1,5,"01:08:15,841","01:08:19,721",3.88,794,Look at you babbling on about love.
1,5,"01:08:15,841","01:08:19,721",3.88,795,That is why you two are still single.
1,5,"01:08:20,596","01:08:23,306",2.71,796,Marriage is no fantasy.
1,5,"01:08:23,390","01:08:24,930",1.54,797,I know what love is.
1,5,"01:08:25,017","01:08:29,855",4.84,798,I even once turned my back on my own master for love.
1,5,"01:08:29,939","01:08:32,479",2.54,799,"However, it was all for nothing."
1,5,"01:08:32,566","01:08:35,435",2.87,800,Let us push forward with the wedding.
1,5,"01:08:40,866","01:08:42,616",1.75,801,An unknown man has broken our barrier and entered.
1,5,"01:08:47,331","01:08:50,791",3.46,802,"Heo Yeom, come outside and greet me."
1,5,"01:08:50,876","01:08:54,666",3.79,803,Who dares to call me by my name?
1,5,"01:08:59,468","01:09:00,508",1.04,804,Yeom.
1,5,"01:09:01,762","01:09:03,102",1.34,805,Have you been well?
1,5,"01:09:04,140","01:09:05,060",0.92,806,Master.
1,5,"01:09:05,891","01:09:06,931",1.04,807,Master.
1,5,"01:09:07,643","01:09:08,693",1.05,808,Master!
1,5,"01:09:10,229","01:09:11,229",1.00,809,Master.
1,5,"01:09:11,313","01:09:13,273",1.96,810,"Goodness, Master."
1,5,"01:09:15,067","01:09:16,357",1.29,811,"Oh, dear."
1,5,"01:09:16,443","01:09:18,323",1.88,812,Put down your swords! Put them away!
1,5,"01:09:41,051","01:09:42,221",1.17,813,Mu-deok.
1,5,"01:09:43,012","01:09:45,812",2.80,814,I thought you were sleeping.
1,5,"01:09:43,012","01:09:45,812",2.80,815,I looked for you everywhere.
1,5,"01:09:45,890","01:09:47,730",1.84,816,Are you still drunk?
1,5,"01:09:48,434","01:09:51,024",2.59,817,I thought I might be able to climb it when I was drunk.
1,5,"01:09:52,146","01:09:55,646",3.50,818,But it is too tall.
1,5,"01:09:52,146","01:09:55,646",3.50,819,I am starting to sober up.
1,5,"01:09:56,317","01:09:59,277",2.96,820,Is this the tree with the bird's nest on top?
1,5,"01:09:59,361","01:10:00,401",1.04,821,Yes.
1,5,"01:10:01,864","01:10:03,914",2.05,822,I want to climb up that tree again.
1,5,"01:10:05,284","01:10:08,704",3.42,823,Did you really climb all the way to the top?
1,5,"01:10:09,914","01:10:11,674",1.76,824,I was Naksu then.
1,5,"01:10:13,292","01:10:16,252",2.96,825,The moon from up there looked beautiful.
1,5,"01:10:17,504","01:10:19,804",2.30,826,But I can no longer see it with this body.
1,5,"01:10:21,926","01:10:24,006",2.08,827,I ran into one of Danju's men today.
1,5,"01:10:24,678","01:10:26,178",1.50,828,He seemed suspicious of me.
1,5,"01:10:27,097","01:10:29,807",2.71,829,"By any chance, did you give him my Spirit Plaque?"
1,5,"01:10:29,892","01:10:32,102",2.21,830,I tried to use the Spirit Plaque to go back.
1,5,"01:10:32,895","01:10:35,555",2.66,831,But he killed the person whom he thought was me.
1,5,"01:10:38,567","01:10:42,858",4.29,832,"If I ever happen to get caught by them, do not try to save me."
1,5,"01:10:44,907","01:10:46,987",2.08,833,Of course. I am too weak to help anyway.
1,5,"01:10:49,328","01:10:52,078",2.75,834,There is nothing your pupil can do for you.
1,5,"01:10:55,626","01:10:56,996",1.37,835,I expected nothing from you.
1,5,"01:11:00,714","01:11:01,804",1.09,836,Mu-deok.
1,5,"01:11:02,466","01:11:05,386",2.92,837,"I may not be able to do much, but I think I can climb that tree."
1,5,"01:11:06,262","01:11:09,062",2.80,838,There are no branches for you to stand on at the top.
1,5,"01:11:10,057","01:11:12,097",2.04,839,You must use your energy to create a foothold.
1,5,"01:11:12,726","01:11:15,186",2.46,840,You must master Chisu in order to do that.
1,5,"01:11:15,813","01:11:17,523",1.71,841,You are nowhere near that level.
1,5,"01:11:17,606","01:11:22,032",4.43,842,"I wanted to do nothing, but I feel motivated to climb this tree."
1,5,"01:11:28,450","01:11:30,240",1.79,843,You said you want to see the moon from there.
1,5,"01:11:30,327","01:11:34,500",4.17,844,"I am the only one who can take you up there, so I would like to try."
1,5,"01:11:35,541","01:11:37,131",1.59,845,Do you wish to go up there?
1,5,"01:11:39,211","01:11:42,171",2.96,846,You must master Chisu in order to be able to climb up there.
1,5,"01:11:43,882","01:11:45,432",1.55,847,Do you wish to go up there?
1,5,"01:11:50,723","01:11:52,473",1.75,848,"Then do me a favor, Uk."
1,5,"01:11:53,726","01:11:55,226",1.50,849,Take me up there.
1,5,"01:11:57,229","01:11:58,479",1.25,850,Fine.
1,5,"01:11:58,564","01:12:01,824",3.26,851,I will take you to the top of that tree.
