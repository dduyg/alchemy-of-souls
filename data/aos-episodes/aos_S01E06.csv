1,6,"00:00:56,097","00:00:58,137",2.04,1,Yul from the Seo family.
1,6,"00:00:59,851","00:01:01,441",1.59,2,Do not come back here ever again.
1,6,"00:01:07,817","00:01:12,283",4.47,3,"If we meet again, I will kill you."
1,6,"00:01:17,744","00:01:47,444",29.70,4,Wait-- I could not stop her from leaving.
1,6,"00:01:48,858","00:01:50,688",1.83,5,I could not ask her why.
1,6,"00:01:51,945","00:01:59,286",7.34,6,"The moment she sliced my sincerity in half, I could no longer cherish our memories together."
1,6,"00:02:00,578","00:02:03,208",2.63,7,It became a secret that I had to bury within my heart.
1,6,"00:02:09,546","00:02:12,966",3.42,8,You are up early. Why are you out here?
1,6,"00:02:17,262","00:02:21,016",3.75,9,Why… did you come here?
1,6,"00:02:23,768","00:02:26,098",2.33,10,I caught a bird. I will cook it for you.
1,6,"00:02:28,982","00:02:30,482",1.50,11,I do not enjoy eating.
1,6,"00:02:30,567","00:02:32,527",1.96,12,I will be cooking rice with chestnuts.
1,6,"00:02:33,653","00:02:35,913",2.26,13,The chestnuts here are very sweet.
1,6,"00:02:39,784","00:02:42,584",2.80,14,Danhyanggok has very sweet chestnuts.
1,6,"00:02:55,758","00:02:57,218",1.46,15,I do not enjoy sweet things.
1,6,"00:03:00,555","00:03:02,765",2.21,16,You could have just declined.
1,6,"00:03:02,849","00:03:05,229",2.38,17,"Given your power, you could have killed me just now."
1,6,"00:03:07,770","00:03:09,190",1.42,18,Do not overreact.
1,6,"00:03:10,148","00:03:13,478",3.33,19,"While it is true I pushed you away, it was with no intention to kill."
1,6,"00:03:13,568","00:03:15,148",1.58,20,So you did push me away.
1,6,"00:03:15,778","00:03:17,698",1.92,21,Do not bother to prepare breakfast.
1,6,"00:03:17,780","00:03:19,240",1.46,22,I will leave once Dang-gu wakes up.
1,6,"00:03:19,324","00:03:21,874",2.55,23,Be my guest if you do not wish to eat.
1,6,"00:03:38,509","00:03:39,889",1.38,24,Why are you still here?
1,6,"00:03:41,763","00:03:43,013",1.25,25,I will eat before I go.
1,6,"00:03:43,598","00:03:44,678",1.08,26,Prepare some food for me.
1,6,"00:03:44,766","00:03:46,386",1.62,27,I thought you did not wish to eat.
1,6,"00:03:46,976","00:03:49,266",2.29,28,I never said that.
1,6,"00:03:46,976","00:03:49,266",2.29,29,Do not put words in my mouth.
1,6,"00:03:51,981","00:03:56,321",4.34,30,"Since you were drunk yesterday, I thought you would still be hungover."
1,6,"00:03:56,402","00:03:58,952",2.55,31,I only declined because I did not want to burden you.
1,6,"00:04:00,031","00:04:01,241",1.21,32,I understand.
1,6,"00:04:02,033","00:04:05,874",3.84,33,"In that case, -I should rinse some more rice."
1,6,"00:04:03,284","00:04:05,874",2.59,34,Where is it?
1,6,"00:04:06,537","00:04:09,247",2.71,35,I will do it.
1,6,"00:04:06,537","00:04:09,247",2.71,36,Have you cooked rice before?
1,6,"00:04:09,332","00:04:12,632",3.30,37,"I have not, but I can do it as long as you teach me."
1,6,"00:04:13,753","00:04:15,173",1.42,38,It is quite simple.
1,6,"00:04:15,838","00:04:20,844",5.01,39,"Rinse it in water, then pour in a decent amount of water, and cook it on high heat."
1,6,"00:04:21,678","00:04:23,848",2.17,40,Then let it sit for some time.
1,6,"00:04:25,181","00:04:26,891",1.71,41,It is pretty simple.
1,6,"00:04:35,608","00:04:38,068",2.46,42,You said you could do it if I taught you.
1,6,"00:04:38,152","00:04:39,862",1.71,43,You said it was simple.
1,6,"00:04:41,406","00:04:44,486",3.08,44,I was wrong. I am sorry.
1,6,"00:04:45,243","00:04:47,703",2.46,45,Jeez. Look at this.
1,6,"00:04:47,787","00:04:49,367",1.58,46,It is all burnt.
1,6,"00:04:50,164","00:04:52,254",2.09,47,Let me make it up to you.
1,6,"00:04:53,835","00:04:55,375",1.54,48,How about those vegetables?
1,6,"00:04:55,461","00:04:56,881",1.42,49,Teach me how to chop them.
1,6,"00:05:01,718","00:05:04,468",2.75,50,"Jeez, what a waste of rice."
1,6,"00:05:01,718","00:05:04,468",2.75,51,Goodness.
1,6,"00:05:11,352","00:05:12,692",1.34,52,Dang-gu.
1,6,"00:05:13,813","00:05:14,693",0.88,53,Hey.
1,6,"00:05:15,273","00:05:16,943",1.67,54,You should bathe here before you go.
1,6,"00:05:17,025","00:05:18,895",1.87,55,The mineral water makes your skin soft.
1,6,"00:05:18,985","00:05:20,565",1.58,56,Have some breakfast too.
1,6,"00:05:20,653","00:05:21,993",1.34,57,Right.
1,6,"00:05:22,071","00:05:24,201",2.13,58,Mu-deok and Yul are making breakfast together.
1,6,"00:05:25,116","00:05:26,486",1.37,59,Together?
1,6,"00:05:25,116","00:05:26,486",1.37,60,Yes.
1,6,"00:05:26,576","00:05:28,866",2.29,61,Yul is cooking rice with Mu-deok.
1,6,"00:05:39,547","00:05:40,417",0.87,62,Goodness.
1,6,"00:05:41,299","00:05:44,929",3.63,63,I told you to cut the green onions into big pieces.
1,6,"00:05:49,932","00:05:51,022",1.09,64,This big?
1,6,"00:05:49,932","00:05:51,022",1.09,65,No.
1,6,"00:05:51,684","00:05:54,234",2.55,66,"Do you not understand what ""big pieces"" mean?"
1,6,"00:05:54,312","00:05:55,902",1.59,67,Big pieces.
1,6,"00:05:58,316","00:06:00,026",1.71,68,Big pieces…
1,6,"00:06:00,109","00:06:01,399",1.29,69,You are wrong.
1,6,"00:06:01,486","00:06:03,196",1.71,70,Those are too small.
1,6,"00:06:04,947","00:06:05,907",0.96,71,Like this.
1,6,"00:06:06,574","00:06:09,914",3.34,72,Big pieces. Like this.
1,6,"00:06:11,079","00:06:14,039",2.96,73,You should have elaborated more.
1,6,"00:06:14,123","00:06:17,043",2.92,74,"How was I to know when all you said was ""big pieces""?"
1,6,"00:06:17,126","00:06:19,456",2.33,75,I thought you were the best mage of Jeongjingak.
1,6,"00:06:19,545","00:06:23,005",3.46,76,How could you not differentiate what is big from small?
1,6,"00:06:24,217","00:06:25,127",0.91,77,Forget it.
1,6,"00:06:25,218","00:06:27,638",2.42,78,Pour a bowl of water into that soup.
1,6,"00:06:35,478","00:06:36,438",0.96,79,Wait…
1,6,"00:06:37,230","00:06:39,190",1.96,80,Which bowl are you talking about?
1,6,"00:06:41,234","00:06:42,244",1.01,81,This one?
1,6,"00:06:45,780","00:06:48,453",2.67,82,Or do you mean this one?
1,6,"00:06:51,202","00:06:52,502",1.30,83,That one.
1,6,"00:06:58,668","00:07:01,588",2.92,84,Why does it look like Mu-deok is scolding him?
1,6,"00:07:02,380","00:07:03,840",1.46,85,Are you sure she likes him?
1,6,"00:07:03,923","00:07:05,383",1.46,86,That is the type of girl she is.
1,6,"00:07:05,883","00:07:09,603",3.72,87,She does not easily like or feel shy in front of others.
1,6,"00:07:12,890","00:07:16,060",3.17,88,Goodness. Look at Yul.
1,6,"00:07:16,853","00:07:19,563",2.71,89,He is still learning well despite being scolded.
1,6,"00:07:22,358","00:07:24,068",1.71,90,Learning?
1,6,"00:07:22,358","00:07:24,068",1.71,91,Look.
1,6,"00:07:24,777","00:07:26,567",1.79,92,I said that was enough.
1,6,"00:07:27,947","00:07:29,407",1.46,93,I do not enjoy salty food.
1,6,"00:07:30,116","00:07:31,076",0.96,94,Jeez.
1,6,"00:07:33,035","00:07:34,405",1.37,95,He was never like that
1,6,"00:07:34,495","00:07:37,415",2.92,96,Taste it yourself.
1,6,"00:07:34,495","00:07:37,415",2.92,97,in front of Master Heo or my uncle.
1,6,"00:07:37,498","00:07:38,708",1.21,98,This is interesting.
1,6,"00:07:39,292","00:07:42,212",2.92,99,Does he not look like an intimidated pupil?
1,6,"00:07:42,295","00:07:43,665",1.37,100,"It is bland, right?"
1,6,"00:07:43,754","00:07:47,514",3.76,101,See? You should have stopped when I told you to.
1,6,"00:07:47,592","00:07:51,012",3.42,102,I am sorry.
1,6,"00:07:47,592","00:07:51,012",3.42,103,A cute master and her diligent pupil.
1,6,"00:07:52,138","00:07:54,428",2.29,104,That is enough. It needs to boil down.
1,6,"00:07:54,515","00:07:56,635",2.12,105,A master and her pupil?
1,6,"00:07:54,515","00:07:56,635",2.12,106,Let it sit.
1,6,"00:07:56,726","00:08:01,233",4.51,107,Why were you so stubborn when this was your first time cooking?
1,6,"00:08:08,404","00:08:09,364",0.96,108,All right.
1,6,"00:08:09,447","00:08:13,077",3.63,109,Let me see how well you taught him and how well you learned from her.
1,6,"00:08:13,618","00:08:15,158",1.54,110,Let me have a taste.
1,6,"00:08:20,541","00:08:21,831",1.29,111,It is tasty.
1,6,"00:08:21,918","00:08:23,208",1.29,112,Tasty?
1,6,"00:08:25,630","00:08:27,840",2.21,113,I seasoned it just as Mu-deok told me to.
1,6,"00:08:30,885","00:08:32,005",1.12,114,Well done.
1,6,"00:08:33,095","00:08:35,885",2.79,115,You must have been elated to be complimented by your master.
1,6,"00:08:36,474","00:08:39,774",3.30,116,I thought I was good at everything since people called me a genius.
1,6,"00:08:40,561","00:08:42,731",2.17,117,But I learned that there are things I am not good at.
1,6,"00:08:42,813","00:08:43,773",0.96,118,Mu-deok.
1,6,"00:08:43,856","00:08:45,476",1.62,119,Thank you for helping me realize this.
1,6,"00:08:45,566","00:08:49,736",4.17,120,It was frustrating since he could not understand me at all.
1,6,"00:08:49,820","00:08:52,490",2.67,121,But he was determined to keep learning.
1,6,"00:08:53,157","00:08:54,827",1.67,122,That is why I kept teaching him.
1,6,"00:08:56,369","00:08:57,749",1.38,123,Look at you exaggerating.
1,6,"00:08:58,371","00:09:00,671",2.30,124,Is this a royal meal or something?
1,6,"00:09:00,748","00:09:03,538",2.79,125,There are things you can learn from preparing a meal.
1,6,"00:09:03,626","00:09:05,206",1.58,126,You should learn as well.
1,6,"00:09:03,626","00:09:08,014",4.39,127,"Sadly, I do not have a great master like he does."
1,6,"00:09:09,924","00:09:11,934",2.01,128,"I am sorry, but the rice is a bit burnt."
1,6,"00:09:12,009","00:09:14,679",2.67,129,I see.
1,6,"00:09:12,009","00:09:14,679",2.67,130,You can learn how to do it again.
1,6,"00:09:14,762","00:09:18,222",3.46,131,"Mu-deok, do you think Yul can do better next time around?"
1,6,"00:09:18,307","00:09:20,847",2.54,132,He is not completely hopeless.
1,6,"00:09:20,935","00:09:22,595",1.66,133,Thank you for your words.
1,6,"00:09:37,577","00:09:38,997",1.42,134,Why are you washing them alone?
1,6,"00:09:39,078","00:09:41,208",2.13,135,Ask your wonderful pupil to help you.
1,6,"00:09:41,289","00:09:44,999",3.71,136,"He prepared the meal, so I ought to clean up."
1,6,"00:09:46,377","00:09:47,917",1.54,137,Were you happy to teach him?
1,6,"00:09:48,588","00:09:51,554",2.97,138,Do you want him to be your pupil?
1,6,"00:09:51,632","00:09:53,632",2.00,139,It would have been easier had he been my pupil.
1,6,"00:09:54,218","00:09:56,298",2.08,140,He is diligent and obedient.
1,6,"00:09:57,096","00:09:59,266",2.17,141,He is not lazy or reckless like you.
1,6,"00:09:59,348","00:10:01,848",2.50,142,"Master, do not cheat on me."
1,6,"00:10:03,436","00:10:04,266",0.83,143,What?
1,6,"00:10:04,353","00:10:06,653",2.30,144,I get that you like him since he is diligent and obedient.
1,6,"00:10:06,731","00:10:09,071",2.34,145,But I am your one and only pupil.
1,6,"00:10:09,150","00:10:12,610",3.46,146,A master should not have multiple pupils and vice versa.
1,6,"00:10:12,695","00:10:15,905",3.21,147,Are you upset because I taught Yul how to cook?
1,6,"00:10:15,990","00:10:20,042",4.05,148,"Yes, I am. How could you teach someone else when your pupil is standing right in front of you?"
1,6,"00:10:20,620","00:10:22,790",2.17,149,"If you are going to teach someone how to cook, it should be me."
1,6,"00:10:22,872","00:10:24,502",1.63,150,Teaching someone else is betrayal and cheating.
1,6,"00:10:25,625","00:10:28,285",2.66,151,I can try to understand the betrayal part.
1,6,"00:10:28,377","00:10:29,587",1.21,152,But cheating?
1,6,"00:10:29,670","00:10:31,130",1.46,153,I am speechless.
1,6,"00:10:34,175","00:10:38,220",4.05,154,I am certain that I sensed cheating.
1,6,"00:10:45,561","00:10:46,771",1.21,155,What was that?
1,6,"00:10:47,813","00:10:48,733",0.92,156,What is it this time?
1,6,"00:10:48,814","00:10:50,574",1.76,157,"Mu-deok, do not cheat on me."
1,6,"00:10:50,650","00:10:52,070",1.42,158,It hurts and upsets me.
1,6,"00:10:52,151","00:10:54,951",2.80,159,I did not know my pupil was this possessive.
1,6,"00:10:55,655","00:11:00,695",5.04,160,Fine. My one and only pupil will be you who spews nonsense first thing in the morning. Happy?
1,6,"00:11:00,785","00:11:02,405",1.62,161,But--
1,6,"00:11:00,785","00:11:02,405",1.62,162,Mu-deok!
1,6,"00:11:03,454","00:11:04,414",0.96,163,Mu-deok!
1,6,"00:11:06,040","00:11:06,920",0.88,164,Young Master.
1,6,"00:11:07,667","00:11:13,302",5.63,165,Would I be cheating if I addressed others as Young Masters and answered their calls?
1,6,"00:11:13,381","00:11:15,131",1.75,166,That cannot be helped.
1,6,"00:11:15,216","00:11:20,222",5.01,167,"But when you address them, be a bit indifferent."
1,6,"00:11:22,014","00:11:23,354",1.34,168,How ridiculous.
1,6,"00:11:25,726","00:11:29,356",3.63,169,Young Master Park! I am coming!
1,6,"00:11:29,438","00:11:32,478",3.04,170,"Mu-deok, you are hurting my feelings."
1,6,"00:11:29,438","00:11:32,478",3.04,171,I told you to be indifferent.
1,6,"00:11:41,158","00:11:42,908",1.75,172,That is one tall tree.
1,6,"00:11:44,912","00:11:47,372",2.46,173,"Yul, was this the tree you wanted to see?"
1,6,"00:11:48,707","00:11:49,957",1.25,174,I think so.
1,6,"00:11:51,377","00:11:53,417",2.04,175,I cannot believe it really exists.
1,6,"00:12:01,512","00:12:04,522",3.01,176,How did you know that I was injured?
1,6,"00:12:05,224","00:12:08,024",2.80,177,There is a really tall tree nearby.
1,6,"00:12:09,770","00:12:13,150",3.38,178,I can see the entirety of Danhyanggok from up there.
1,6,"00:12:18,612","00:12:21,532",2.92,179,You can see the entirety of Danhyanggok from up there.
1,6,"00:12:25,077","00:12:29,424",4.35,180,"Does that mean you have climbed up that tree before, Mu-deok?"
1,6,"00:12:33,419","00:12:36,379",2.96,181,That was just my guess since the tree was so tall.
1,6,"00:12:38,257","00:12:40,427",2.17,182,Then do you want to climb it?
1,6,"00:12:40,509","00:12:42,179",1.67,183,Should I help you get up there?
1,6,"00:12:42,845","00:12:45,465",2.62,184,"Dang-gu, you cannot climb that tree."
1,6,"00:12:45,556","00:12:48,886",3.33,185,You need to have mastered at least Chisu to go up there.
1,6,"00:12:50,144","00:12:51,154",1.01,186,Is that so?
1,6,"00:12:51,770","00:12:53,270",1.50,187,Should I try?
1,6,"00:12:53,856","00:12:54,856",1.00,188,Yes.
1,6,"00:12:54,940","00:12:56,860",1.92,189,Maybe you could do it.
1,6,"00:12:57,443","00:12:58,743",1.30,190,"Mu-deok, go with him."
1,6,"00:13:02,448","00:13:03,528",1.08,191,Do you want to go up there?
1,6,"00:13:08,829","00:13:10,119",1.29,192,"No, thank you."
1,6,"00:13:10,206","00:13:13,326",3.12,193,I do not want to climb such a special tree with just anyone.
1,6,"00:13:18,255","00:13:19,085",0.83,194,"""Just anyone""?"
1,6,"00:13:22,259","00:13:25,469",3.21,195,I guess she is too afraid to go up there.
1,6,"00:13:25,554","00:13:26,894",1.34,196,Let us go.
1,6,"00:13:38,275","00:13:40,275",2.00,197,I examined the core of his energy.
1,6,"00:13:41,529","00:13:44,319",2.79,198,"He was a commoner, not a mage."
1,6,"00:13:45,324","00:13:48,494",3.17,199,I am certain that there are more victims.
1,6,"00:13:48,577","00:13:51,957",3.38,200,There is a soul shifter among us.
1,6,"00:13:52,540","00:13:54,460",1.92,201,"What should we do, Master Lee?"
1,6,"00:13:54,542","00:13:58,961",4.42,202,Locating the origin of this sorcery is direr than catching the soul shifter.
1,6,"00:13:59,797","00:14:01,337",1.54,203,I suspect Cheonbugwan.
1,6,"00:14:03,175","00:14:09,056",5.88,204,This soul shifter who had entered Songrim recently was a constellation recorder mage there.
1,6,"00:14:10,015","00:14:17,483",7.47,205,"Also, the one who killed Naksu, who died while soul shifting, and destroyed all traces of her men was Assistant Gwanju Jin Mu."
1,6,"00:14:18,941","00:14:20,651",1.71,206,Naksu…
1,6,"00:14:27,616","00:14:30,366",2.75,207,We identified him with the possessions he had.
1,6,"00:14:30,452","00:14:31,582",1.13,208,Who was he?
1,6,"00:14:31,662","00:14:34,042",2.38,209,He was a low-ranking servant from Cheonbugwan.
1,6,"00:14:34,123","00:14:37,593",3.47,210,What? Cheonbugwan was involved once again.
1,6,"00:14:37,668","00:14:40,338",2.67,211,I will confront Jin Mu right now.
1,6,"00:14:40,421","00:14:42,011",1.59,212,Follow me.
1,6,"00:14:42,089","00:14:43,299",1.21,213,Yeom!
1,6,"00:14:43,966","00:14:44,926",0.96,214,Yes?
1,6,"00:14:45,593","00:14:46,723",1.13,215,Do not do anything.
1,6,"00:14:48,596","00:14:51,716",3.12,216,You used to ruin everything due to your recklessness back in the day.
1,6,"00:14:51,807","00:14:53,887",2.08,217,"You may have aged now, but your temper remains."
1,6,"00:14:54,810","00:14:56,480",1.67,218,"I am sorry, Master Lee."
1,6,"00:14:57,062","00:14:58,192",1.13,219,It is not the time yet.
1,6,"00:14:58,272","00:15:02,232",3.96,220,We must observe Cheonbugwan discreetly.
1,6,"00:15:02,318","00:15:03,608",1.29,221,Jin.
1,6,"00:15:04,612","00:15:06,162",1.55,222,You have grown up well.
1,6,"00:15:07,448","00:15:09,578",2.13,223,You used to wear a diaper and roam around.
1,6,"00:15:09,658","00:15:12,908",3.25,224,I cannot believe you are all grown up and leading your people.
1,6,"00:15:17,708","00:15:18,788",1.08,225,Master Lee.
1,6,"00:15:25,049","00:15:26,679",1.63,226,Who is he?
1,6,"00:15:28,135","00:15:33,307",5.17,227,"He was the pupil of Master Seo Gyeong, the founder of Songrim."
1,6,"00:15:34,350","00:15:35,810",1.46,228,But he is so young.
1,6,"00:15:36,936","00:15:38,266",1.33,229,He is not.
1,6,"00:15:39,146","00:15:44,938",5.79,230,I still remember singing… at his 100th birthday party.
1,6,"00:15:48,614","00:15:50,074",1.46,231,I even danced.
1,6,"00:15:53,827","00:15:56,707",2.88,232,Is this dog Gwigu?
1,6,"00:15:58,916","00:16:03,376",4.46,233,So it was you who took Gwigu from Jinyowon.
1,6,"00:16:04,380","00:16:06,720",2.34,234,He will find the soul shifter.
1,6,"00:16:07,508","00:16:09,968",2.46,235,"Naksu was the one who died while soul shifting, right?"
1,6,"00:16:10,052","00:16:10,892",0.84,236,"Yes, Master Lee."
1,6,"00:16:10,970","00:16:14,430",3.46,237,She was a notorious assassin who was talented in spells.
1,6,"00:16:16,809","00:16:19,349",2.54,238,Was it Naksu's soul that I sensed?
1,6,"00:16:31,740","00:16:36,454",4.71,239,"The one who has Jang Gang's sword -is his son, Jang Uk, right?"
1,6,"00:16:34,284","00:16:36,454",2.17,240,Yes.
1,6,"00:16:36,537","00:16:40,367",3.83,241,Have you seen him before?
1,6,"00:16:40,457","00:16:45,588",5.13,242,I met a boy with a binding bracelet and his maid who followed him around.
1,6,"00:16:47,339","00:16:48,629",1.29,243,It was interesting.
1,6,"00:16:55,723","00:16:58,273",2.55,244,Mu-deok packed us some chestnuts.
1,6,"00:16:58,350","00:17:00,980",2.63,245,"Yes, they are sweet."
1,6,"00:16:58,350","00:17:00,980",2.63,246,Give some to Maidservant Kim as well.
1,6,"00:17:01,061","00:17:01,941",0.88,247,Sure.
1,6,"00:17:10,946","00:17:12,486",1.54,248,Why did you bring your father's sword?
1,6,"00:17:13,115","00:17:15,365",2.25,249,"Oh, that? Mu-deok brought it."
1,6,"00:17:15,451","00:17:18,541",3.09,250,"You are not going to train, so why did you bring this precious sword?"
1,6,"00:17:19,288","00:17:20,658",1.37,251,Should I give it to Maidservant Kim?
1,6,"00:17:22,583","00:17:28,297",5.71,252,You… are not his son.
1,6,"00:17:31,800","00:17:32,930",1.13,253,Do as you wish.
1,6,"00:17:37,139","00:17:38,309",1.17,254,Let us go.
1,6,"00:17:37,139","00:17:38,309",1.17,255,Sure.
1,6,"00:17:41,018","00:17:43,648",2.63,256,Did you say you came here often to pick herbs?
1,6,"00:17:44,980","00:17:48,860",3.88,257,Have you ever encountered someone who lived here?
1,6,"00:17:48,942","00:17:51,952",3.01,258,"No, Young Master Seo."
1,6,"00:17:48,942","00:17:51,952",3.01,259,Who would live in a place like this?
1,6,"00:17:53,322","00:17:54,572",1.25,260,I see.
1,6,"00:17:59,286","00:18:00,496",1.21,261,One more thing.
1,6,"00:18:02,539","00:18:04,669",2.13,262,Did it get pretty cold during the winter?
1,6,"00:18:06,126","00:18:07,536",1.41,263,Why do you ask?
1,6,"00:18:09,671","00:18:11,421",1.75,264,I never came here during the winter.
1,6,"00:18:14,426","00:18:16,426",2.00,265,I worried whenever it started snowing.
1,6,"00:18:18,222","00:18:23,850",5.63,266,I worried if it was too cold or if things were all right amid the snow.
1,6,"00:18:34,154","00:18:38,949",4.80,267,It is actually warmer than you think.
1,6,"00:18:42,037","00:18:45,037",3.00,268,The snow quickly melts in the sunny spots.
1,6,"00:18:47,960","00:18:49,920",1.96,269,Is that so? I am relieved.
1,6,"00:18:56,051","00:19:02,099",6.05,270,There is a variety of food to eat during the winter and many places to take refuge from the snow.
1,6,"00:19:04,977","00:19:07,347",2.37,271,I bet this will be tasty.
1,6,"00:19:04,977","00:19:07,347",2.37,272,They are really sweet.
1,6,"00:19:10,315","00:19:11,725",1.41,273,Should we stay a day more?
1,6,"00:19:13,152","00:19:15,652",2.50,274,Mu-deok must really like him.
1,6,"00:19:20,200","00:19:24,408",4.21,275,She does not like him.
1,6,"00:19:24,496","00:19:26,996",2.50,276,I am telling you. She does.
1,6,"00:19:27,708","00:19:28,628",0.92,277,Look.
1,6,"00:19:28,709","00:19:32,799",4.09,278,She does not look at us the same way she looks at him.
1,6,"00:19:41,263","00:19:42,933",1.67,279,The wind keeps blowing.
1,6,"00:19:51,607","00:19:53,317",1.71,280,Is it coming from her?
1,6,"00:19:57,070","00:19:58,030",0.96,281,"Dang-gu, let us go."
1,6,"00:19:58,655","00:19:59,735",1.08,282,All right.
1,6,"00:20:04,036","00:20:05,786",1.75,283,"Goodbye, Mu-deok."
1,6,"00:20:11,251","00:20:12,291",1.04,284,Let us go.
1,6,"00:20:19,676","00:20:21,216",1.54,285,I will see them off.
1,6,"00:20:33,982","00:20:36,152",2.17,286,Bye.
1,6,"00:20:33,982","00:20:36,152",2.17,287,Bye.
1,6,"00:20:37,069","00:20:39,279",2.21,288,Try to remember where you had lost your Spirit Plaque.
1,6,"00:20:39,863","00:20:41,953",2.09,289,I will.
1,6,"00:20:39,863","00:20:41,953",2.09,290,Lie low.
1,6,"00:20:42,449","00:20:44,619",2.17,291,The Unanimous Assembly was summoned because of you.
1,6,"00:20:44,701","00:20:47,621",2.92,292,I guess all 12 of my former masters attended it.
1,6,"00:20:47,704","00:20:50,544",2.84,293,They were all so heartless to their former pupil.
1,6,"00:20:51,208","00:20:54,088",2.88,294,They even mentioned cutting off your energy flow.
1,6,"00:20:54,836","00:20:57,086",2.25,295,Why would they say that?
1,6,"00:20:54,836","00:20:57,086",2.25,296,What?
1,6,"00:20:59,591","00:21:01,341",1.75,297,Because you avoided your duel by fleeing.
1,6,"00:21:03,011","00:21:04,811",1.80,298,But it is a ridiculous duel.
1,6,"00:21:04,888","00:21:06,718",1.83,299,And you did not want it either.
1,6,"00:21:06,807","00:21:09,017",2.21,300,Nobody is expecting you to come to that duel.
1,6,"00:21:09,101","00:21:12,771",3.67,301,So just stay here and be laid-back like always.
1,6,"00:21:15,148","00:21:16,858",1.71,302,The leader wanted to know something.
1,6,"00:21:18,402","00:21:20,492",2.09,303,He asked if you were doing as you were told.
1,6,"00:21:22,739","00:21:27,291",4.55,304,You are the result of your mother's love affair.
1,6,"00:21:27,369","00:21:29,909",2.54,305,But we cannot allow you to lead Cheonbugwan after your father.
1,6,"00:21:29,997","00:21:37,495",7.50,306,So stop dreaming of becoming… like your father.
1,6,"00:21:38,088","00:21:44,218",6.13,307,Just stay a clueless Young Master of the Jang family.
1,6,"00:21:47,597","00:21:49,927",2.33,308,Can I tell him that you are?
1,6,"00:21:50,017","00:21:51,937",1.92,309,Have I ever listened to anyone?
1,6,"00:21:52,561","00:21:55,441",2.88,310,Tell him I am doing the very opposite and being reckless.
1,6,"00:21:58,692","00:21:59,862",1.17,311,"Dang-gu, leave that here."
1,6,"00:22:00,861","00:22:01,781",0.92,312,Why?
1,6,"00:22:02,654","00:22:04,954",2.30,313,I want to help Mu-deok catch a pheasant.
1,6,"00:22:09,369","00:22:10,579",1.21,314,Goodbye.
1,6,"00:22:16,043","00:22:18,633",2.59,315,Did we hurt his pride?
1,6,"00:22:18,712","00:22:19,592",0.88,316,Let him be.
1,6,"00:22:19,671","00:22:22,171",2.50,317,We cannot ask him to come and meet a dignified death.
1,6,"00:22:30,140","00:22:32,480",2.34,318,So you retrieved the sword you threw away.
1,6,"00:22:35,020","00:22:37,020",2.00,319,It hurt my pride to hear that I was a laughingstock.
1,6,"00:22:39,149","00:22:41,899",2.75,320,"In that case, let us train as if your life depended on it."
1,6,"00:22:43,236","00:22:47,873",4.64,321,You seem happy to hear that your pupil became a laughingstock.
1,6,"00:22:48,658","00:22:51,078",2.42,322,"Since we are on the topic, let me add more motivation."
1,6,"00:22:52,329","00:22:55,619",3.29,323,Your friends did not ask you to return home with them.
1,6,"00:22:55,707","00:22:58,457",2.75,324,"Had they been in your shoes, they would have fought to their deaths."
1,6,"00:22:58,543","00:23:01,463",2.92,325,But they told you to hide and run away.
1,6,"00:23:02,547","00:23:03,667",1.12,326,Can you guess why?
1,6,"00:23:06,134","00:23:08,724",2.59,327,That is because you are worthless.
1,6,"00:23:10,639","00:23:12,599",1.96,328,Your tongue is sharp like a sword.
1,6,"00:23:13,475","00:23:16,475",3.00,329,You do not hesitate to cut me with your words. How merciless.
1,6,"00:23:16,561","00:23:20,897",4.34,330,I would not hesitate to stab you with a sword if that could get you back on your feet.
1,6,"00:23:20,982","00:23:22,032",1.05,331,"Yes, Master."
1,6,"00:23:22,109","00:23:24,359",2.25,332,Keep stabbing your worthless pupil.
1,6,"00:23:27,072","00:23:29,122",2.05,333,Why are you not motivated after what I said?
1,6,"00:23:29,199","00:23:30,489",1.29,334,Why are you dispirited?
1,6,"00:23:32,994","00:23:35,214",2.22,335,Your spiteful words demotivated me.
1,6,"00:23:35,956","00:23:37,416",1.46,336,I need to bathe and cool myself down.
1,6,"00:23:39,209","00:23:41,169",1.96,337,Why does he bathe so much in one day?
1,6,"00:23:41,253","00:23:42,753",1.50,338,You worthless and lazy scumbag.
1,6,"00:23:42,838","00:23:44,168",1.33,339,I hope you burn yourself in hot water!
1,6,"00:23:45,549","00:23:49,009",3.46,340,Unbelievable. What kind of a master says such a thing to her pupil?
1,6,"00:23:54,224","00:23:58,404",4.18,341,Did Uk not know how he lost his Spirit Plaque?
1,6,"00:23:59,354","00:24:03,815",4.46,342,"Maybe someone sold it after he had dropped it, and that is how those men got hold of it."
1,6,"00:24:03,900","00:24:05,860",1.96,343,I heard there was a place where they sold such plaques.
1,6,"00:24:07,070","00:24:09,870",2.80,344,Keep tracking his Spirit Plaque.
1,6,"00:24:11,032","00:24:12,332",1.30,345,"Yes, my lord."
1,6,"00:24:11,032","00:24:12,332",1.30,346,"Yes, my lord."
1,6,"00:24:12,409","00:24:18,077",5.67,347,How… is Uk doing?
1,6,"00:24:20,709","00:24:23,249",2.54,348,He is doing well. He fishes and drinks.
1,6,"00:24:24,337","00:24:26,457",2.12,349,He has yet to unfasten the binding bracelet.
1,6,"00:24:28,800","00:24:29,890",1.09,350,You may go.
1,6,"00:24:51,156","00:24:52,616",1.46,351,It is not that heavy anymore.
1,6,"00:24:52,699","00:24:54,239",1.54,352,It does not hinder my movement either.
1,6,"00:24:54,326","00:24:59,035",4.71,353,Some mages train with an iron rod to strengthen their arms to better wield their swords.
1,6,"00:24:59,539","00:25:05,002",5.46,354,You were unknowingly strengthening yourself by wearing that heavy bracelet all day.
1,6,"00:25:05,086","00:25:08,878",3.79,355,"It was not intentional, but you found yourself an excellent training tool."
1,6,"00:25:10,175","00:25:11,715",1.54,356,You are extraordinarily lucky.
1,6,"00:25:11,801","00:25:15,181",3.38,357,"If I take this off, I will be faster and stronger."
1,6,"00:25:15,764","00:25:19,234",3.47,358,"But if you fail to control yourself, you will become even more reckless."
1,6,"00:25:20,977","00:25:22,017",1.04,359,I…
1,6,"00:25:22,687","00:25:23,687",1.00,360,Never mind.
1,6,"00:25:27,609","00:25:30,699",3.09,361,What did you and Yul talk about?
1,6,"00:25:33,114","00:25:34,624",1.51,362,About Danhyanggok.
1,6,"00:25:36,618","00:25:39,618",3.00,363,He asked how it was during the winter.
1,6,"00:25:43,792","00:25:48,089",4.30,364,You have met Naksu when you were young?
1,6,"00:25:50,048","00:25:53,088",3.04,365,I was still unsure after seeing her body.
1,6,"00:25:53,176","00:25:55,716",2.54,366,But going to Danhyanggok helped me confirm it.
1,6,"00:25:55,804","00:25:56,894",1.09,367,That is why I am telling you now.
1,6,"00:25:57,973","00:26:01,773",3.80,368,Danhyanggok is a deep and dangerous valley.
1,6,"00:26:01,851","00:26:04,521",2.67,369,A young girl cannot possibly survive there on her own.
1,6,"00:26:04,604","00:26:07,324",2.72,370,It seemed like she was living in hiding.
1,6,"00:26:08,733","00:26:13,781",5.05,371,"After she learned of my name and my family, I was not able to see her again."
1,6,"00:26:14,990","00:26:17,450",2.46,372,That must mean she recognized your name.
1,6,"00:26:18,243","00:26:21,333",3.09,373,Tell me everything you know about her.
1,6,"00:26:24,124","00:26:25,504",1.38,374,There is nothing.
1,6,"00:26:26,126","00:26:27,876",1.75,375,I do not know her name or age.
1,6,"00:26:28,545","00:26:32,165",3.62,376,"Other than the cliff where we called out for birds, I have never been to her abode."
1,6,"00:26:36,303","00:26:37,263",0.96,377,There is one thing.
1,6,"00:26:40,181","00:26:42,101",1.92,378,She once mentioned her father.
1,6,"00:26:53,153","00:26:56,913",3.76,379,My father wrote down the stars.
1,6,"00:26:58,825","00:27:01,235",2.41,380,I did not think much of it back then.
1,6,"00:27:01,328","00:27:05,619",4.29,381,But writing down the stars is what a constellation recorder from Cheonbugwan does.
1,6,"00:27:07,000","00:27:08,130",1.13,382,My lord.
1,6,"00:27:08,626","00:27:13,665",5.04,383,"Among their constellation recorder mages, do any of them have a grudge against us?"
1,6,"00:27:16,676","00:27:20,644",3.97,384,A constellation recorder from Cheonbugwan?
1,6,"00:27:22,640","00:27:23,730",1.09,385,A mage?
1,6,"00:27:28,563","00:27:35,569",7.01,386,"Twenty years ago, there was one constellation recorder mage who died in the hands of the four families."
1,6,"00:27:37,447","00:27:40,737",3.29,387,His entire family lost their lives that day.
1,6,"00:27:41,409","00:27:42,829",1.42,388,Except for one member.
1,6,"00:27:42,911","00:27:45,711",2.80,389,His one and only daughter disappeared.
1,6,"00:28:12,107","00:28:16,863",4.76,390,So our family was involved in her father's death.
1,6,"00:28:17,445","00:28:21,569",4.12,391,She must have been hostile toward you because your family was involved in her father's death.
1,6,"00:28:21,658","00:28:24,578",2.92,392,Is there anything else that you remember?
1,6,"00:28:25,161","00:28:26,831",1.67,393,This was a very long time ago.
1,6,"00:28:27,872","00:28:29,582",1.71,394,I do not remember anything else.
1,6,"00:28:52,564","00:28:54,274",1.71,395,Because I missed them.
1,6,"00:28:55,567","00:28:57,777",2.21,396,The broken leg did not bother me.
1,6,"00:28:57,861","00:28:59,651",1.79,397,And I was not scared to get scolded.
1,6,"00:29:04,075","00:29:05,905",1.83,398,I liked them a lot.
1,6,"00:29:15,128","00:29:19,258",4.13,399,I saw you using that to summon your bird a few times.
1,6,"00:29:21,176","00:29:22,426",1.25,400,I would also like to try.
1,6,"00:29:23,428","00:29:25,348",1.92,401,Can I have that?
1,6,"00:30:21,236","00:30:22,856",1.62,402,The Crown Prince is powerful.
1,6,"00:30:23,488","00:30:27,908",4.42,403,There is only one way my pupil can subdue him and stay alive.
1,6,"00:30:28,827","00:30:30,197",1.37,404,Tansu.
1,6,"00:31:04,237","00:31:05,987",1.75,405,What do you want me to do?
1,6,"00:31:07,699","00:31:09,619",1.92,406,Slice through the water drops as they fall.
1,6,"00:31:11,035","00:31:12,325",1.29,407,They are not raindrops.
1,6,"00:31:12,412","00:31:17,333",4.92,408,Even someone unskilled as you can slice through such slow-moving water drops.
1,6,"00:31:18,001","00:31:18,881",0.88,409,Go on.
1,6,"00:31:40,189","00:31:42,069",1.88,410,Only three drops in one breath.
1,6,"00:31:42,942","00:31:44,112",1.17,411,That does not matter.
1,6,"00:31:44,193","00:31:47,743",3.55,412,"Tansu, the skill you will master, will only require you to slice one."
1,6,"00:31:47,822","00:31:48,952",1.13,413,Tansu?
1,6,"00:31:50,491","00:31:51,661",1.17,414,Look here.
1,6,"00:31:52,160","00:31:57,077",4.92,415,"I understand that I am a quick study, but mastering Tansu is pushing it."
1,6,"00:31:57,165","00:31:59,745",2.58,416,I guess having 12 masters in the past has taught you something.
1,6,"00:31:59,834","00:32:00,844",1.01,417,That is correct.
1,6,"00:32:00,919","00:32:03,709",2.79,418,You can only learn that skill once you have mastered Chisu.
1,6,"00:32:04,380","00:32:09,054",4.67,419,"You barely mastered Ryusu, yet you are still struggling to control your energy."
1,6,"00:32:09,135","00:32:10,965",1.83,420,A subpar pupil like you cannot learn it.
1,6,"00:32:12,305","00:32:13,425",1.12,421,But?
1,6,"00:32:14,057","00:32:21,360",7.30,422,But that is the only way for you to fight against the Crown Prince and come out alive.
1,6,"00:32:55,848","00:32:58,938",3.09,423,Tansu is swordsmanship that involves flicking energy with your sword.
1,6,"00:32:59,018","00:33:04,111",5.09,424,"Your right arm may lack the skills, but it has become stronger thanks to the binding bracelet."
1,6,"00:33:05,233","00:33:06,113",0.88,425,Just one drop.
1,6,"00:33:07,193","00:33:10,203",3.01,426,Hit one waterdrop so you can gather and flick your energy.
1,6,"00:33:22,542","00:33:24,292",1.75,427,You will not master it that quickly.
1,6,"00:33:24,961","00:33:26,421",1.46,428,Let us eat and resume.
1,6,"00:34:14,594","00:34:15,764",1.17,429,Tansu?
1,6,"00:34:16,554","00:34:18,354",1.80,430,He will never master that skill.
1,6,"00:34:21,059","00:34:26,654",5.59,431,That is not a relationship of a maid and her young master but that of a master and her pupil.
1,6,"00:36:05,913","00:36:07,083",1.17,432,Mu-deok.
1,6,"00:36:09,167","00:36:11,337",2.17,433,So you are training him.
1,6,"00:36:14,380","00:36:16,260",1.88,434,I see he was studying Tansu.
1,6,"00:36:17,133","00:36:18,343",1.21,435,Where did you learn that?
1,6,"00:36:18,926","00:36:22,926",4.00,436,Young Master Jang is quite knowledgeable thanks to his former 12 masters.
1,6,"00:36:23,014","00:36:25,064",2.05,437,Is he trying to run before learning to walk?
1,6,"00:36:25,141","00:36:27,271",2.13,438,He has a long way to go.
1,6,"00:36:27,351","00:36:29,601",2.25,439,"In any case, he should try."
1,6,"00:36:30,188","00:36:32,898",2.71,440,His next step could lead him to his death.
1,6,"00:36:36,903","00:36:39,113",2.21,441,Is your young master aware of that?
1,6,"00:37:14,482","00:37:16,482",2.00,442,Why did you not dodge it?
1,6,"00:37:16,567","00:37:17,647",1.08,443,Seriously.
1,6,"00:37:33,501","00:37:35,751",2.25,444,That is the result of forcing your energy to come out.
1,6,"00:37:36,921","00:37:38,971",2.05,445,Your arm could burst if this continues.
1,6,"00:37:45,137","00:37:48,467",3.33,446,It looks like it could rot.
1,6,"00:37:45,137","00:37:48,467",3.33,447,Then you will have to cut it off.
1,6,"00:37:49,141","00:37:50,271",1.13,448,Are you serious?
1,6,"00:37:54,438","00:37:59,400",4.96,449,"If the rotten energy spreads throughout your body, you could die."
1,6,"00:38:19,130","00:38:21,380",2.25,450,The heat has subsided. You are fine.
1,6,"00:38:21,465","00:38:23,085",1.62,451,Rest up. That is the best remedy.
1,6,"00:38:23,884","00:38:24,894",1.01,452,What a liar.
1,6,"00:38:27,054","00:38:28,854",1.80,453,"Everything he said was true, right?"
1,6,"00:38:29,390","00:38:38,192",8.80,454,"But then again, whether I die of poison, flogging, being stabbed, or my hand exploding, this merciless master does not worry about her pupil."
1,6,"00:38:39,775","00:38:41,185",1.41,455,That is right.
1,6,"00:38:42,111","00:38:46,121",4.01,456,It is because you are extremely lucky and worthy.
1,6,"00:38:46,866","00:38:49,196",2.33,457,Lying is becoming second nature to you.
1,6,"00:38:52,371","00:38:54,461",2.09,458,I am just not trying to dispirit you.
1,6,"00:38:55,041","00:38:58,211",3.17,459,"I see. Thank you, my cruel master."
1,6,"00:38:58,294","00:39:00,884",2.59,460,But stay away when I am holding a sword from now on.
1,6,"00:39:00,963","00:39:02,553",1.59,461,You almost got stabbed back there.
1,6,"00:39:02,631","00:39:06,011",3.38,462,I only stood still because I wanted you to control it.
1,6,"00:39:06,635","00:39:07,925",1.29,463,I was not trying to hinder you.
1,6,"00:39:08,012","00:39:10,772",2.76,464,You were not hindering me.
1,6,"00:39:08,012","00:39:10,772",2.76,465,I am just worried about you.
1,6,"00:39:17,396","00:39:21,573",4.18,466,Think of me as a mother bird who is worried about her egg cracking.
1,6,"00:39:19,523","00:39:21,573",2.05,467,Can you even relate?
1,6,"00:39:21,650","00:39:24,200",2.55,468,Whatever. What you did barely made me crack.
1,6,"00:39:24,278","00:39:25,398",1.12,469,I could have dodged it.
1,6,"00:39:26,155","00:39:27,365",1.21,470,It was not dangerous?
1,6,"00:39:27,448","00:39:29,658",2.21,471,How could you have dodged it when I was so fast?
1,6,"00:39:29,742","00:39:31,412",1.67,472,You were not that fast.
1,6,"00:39:32,078","00:39:33,448",1.37,473,You little…
1,6,"00:39:35,289","00:39:36,869",1.58,474,"Could not dodge that, could you?"
1,6,"00:39:36,957","00:39:38,457",1.50,475,You attacked without warning!
1,6,"00:39:38,542","00:39:40,292",1.75,476,Really? Then I will warn you.
1,6,"00:39:40,378","00:39:41,458",1.08,477,"Mu-deok, your eyes."
1,6,"00:39:42,463","00:39:43,303",0.84,478,Jeez…
1,6,"00:39:44,090","00:39:45,130",1.04,479,You bastard.
1,6,"00:39:45,216","00:39:47,216",2.00,480,I cannot believe you fell for that again.
1,6,"00:39:52,181","00:39:53,431",1.25,481,Do that again.
1,6,"00:39:54,475","00:39:55,935",1.46,482,From this up close?
1,6,"00:39:56,018","00:39:57,598",1.58,483,Really?
1,6,"00:39:56,018","00:39:57,598",1.58,484,Try me.
1,6,"00:40:02,316","00:40:03,436",1.12,485,Mu-deok.
1,6,"00:40:04,693","00:40:06,863",2.17,486,The blue marks are barely visible now.
1,6,"00:40:07,738","00:40:09,068",1.33,487,They were quite pretty.
1,6,"00:40:12,952","00:40:16,542",3.59,488,And you should not provoke me when we are this close.
1,6,"00:40:17,206","00:40:20,002",2.80,489,Do you not think I would do something else from this distance?
1,6,"00:40:24,255","00:40:26,255",2.00,490,I guess you understood what I meant.
1,6,"00:40:27,133","00:40:29,263",2.13,491,Maybe there are things I can teach you in this field.
1,6,"00:40:33,722","00:40:34,892",1.17,492,Jang Uk.
1,6,"00:40:38,144","00:40:41,864",3.72,493,You must think I am naive for having lived alone here.
1,6,"00:40:43,274","00:40:44,574",1.30,494,"Well, I guess."
1,6,"00:40:46,527","00:40:49,527",3.00,495,I will have you know I can teach you in other ways too.
1,6,"00:40:50,739","00:40:51,869",1.13,496,Such as?
1,6,"00:40:58,998","00:41:00,288",1.29,497,Hey! You…
1,6,"00:41:00,374","00:41:05,746",5.37,498,A truly skilled individual attacks when their enemy least expects it.
1,6,"00:41:06,297","00:41:08,127",1.83,499,"Keep that in mind, my pupil."
1,6,"00:41:09,341","00:41:12,801",3.46,500,"Unlike me, you poked me really hard!"
1,6,"00:41:12,887","00:41:14,507",1.62,501,Mu-deok.
1,6,"00:41:16,182","00:41:18,522",2.34,502,Hey. Mu-deok.
1,6,"00:41:28,736","00:41:30,526",1.79,503,Is that a new concubine?
1,6,"00:41:31,363","00:41:34,453",3.09,504,He does not even bother to follow the formalities anymore.
1,6,"00:41:35,075","00:41:37,325",2.25,505,She is from a small family of mages from the east.
1,6,"00:41:37,411","00:41:40,661",3.25,506,A comet brushed past the Big Dipper the day she was born.
1,6,"00:41:40,748","00:41:44,458",3.71,507,"At this rate, he will summon every woman born with strange horoscopes."
1,6,"00:41:44,543","00:41:47,173",2.63,508,He just wants the King's Star.
1,6,"00:41:58,182","00:42:04,404",6.22,509,"When the late king ascended the throne, it was prophesized that the next king would have the energy of the King's Star."
1,6,"00:42:05,523","00:42:08,283",2.76,510,The people of Daeho were delighted.
1,6,"00:42:08,359","00:42:12,448",4.09,511,"However, your father who had an ordinary horoscope ascended the throne next."
1,6,"00:42:12,530","00:42:14,320",1.79,512,And you are no different either.
1,6,"00:42:15,115","00:42:16,655",1.54,513,So people started talking.
1,6,"00:42:17,535","00:42:19,365",1.83,514,The divination was incorrect.
1,6,"00:42:19,453","00:42:23,173",3.72,515,Gwanju Jang Gang fled after giving such a ridiculous divination.
1,6,"00:42:23,249","00:42:25,289",2.04,516,Your father believes in it.
1,6,"00:42:25,876","00:42:27,626",1.75,517,That is why you are afraid.
1,6,"00:42:30,089","00:42:31,549",1.46,518,I am not afraid.
1,6,"00:42:31,632","00:42:36,680",5.05,519,You are afraid that someone with that energy will appear or that your father may have a son like that.
1,6,"00:42:37,555","00:42:39,385",1.83,520,I am aware of that.
1,6,"00:42:42,810","00:42:45,560",2.75,521,Your duel against Jang Uk is around the corner.
1,6,"00:42:45,646","00:42:48,976",3.33,522,Eliminate the son of that man who gave such a terrifying divination.
1,6,"00:42:50,609","00:42:53,399",2.79,523,You must get rid of your fears when you can.
1,6,"00:42:56,031","00:42:59,535",3.50,524,Do you think he will even show up that day?
1,6,"00:43:00,536","00:43:01,616",1.08,525,I heard he fled.
1,6,"00:43:02,538","00:43:05,998",3.46,526,Rumor has it that he is even contemplating marriage to avoid it.
1,6,"00:43:07,167","00:43:08,457",1.29,527,Marriage?
1,6,"00:43:08,544","00:43:12,464",3.92,528,I heard he is marrying into the Jin family so he can earn the Jin family's plaque.
1,6,"00:43:18,887","00:43:20,887",2.00,529,Uk and Cho-yeon are getting married?
1,6,"00:43:21,682","00:43:23,522",1.84,530,Did they not break off their engagement before?
1,6,"00:43:24,435","00:43:26,395",1.96,531,That is why it is easier to prepare for it.
1,6,"00:43:27,187","00:43:32,652",5.47,532,She still had the marriage gifts from last time.
1,6,"00:43:35,696","00:43:36,776",1.08,533,I see.
1,6,"00:43:37,281","00:43:40,161",2.88,534,"After the marriage ceremony, Jang Uk…"
1,6,"00:43:40,242","00:43:43,202",2.96,535,"I mean, my husband will move in here."
1,6,"00:43:43,704","00:43:46,214",2.51,536,But my current room is too small for both of us.
1,6,"00:43:46,290","00:43:50,750",4.46,537,Can we use the big room in the east instead?
1,6,"00:43:51,337","00:43:54,087",2.75,538,But that is your sister's room.
1,6,"00:43:55,591","00:43:58,141",2.55,539,It is the best room we have.
1,6,"00:43:58,218","00:44:01,258",3.04,540,It is such a waste to keep it vacant for over a decade.
1,6,"00:44:02,264","00:44:03,724",1.46,541,It was never vacant.
1,6,"00:44:04,433","00:44:06,143",1.71,542,Bu-yeon will return.
1,6,"00:44:07,561","00:44:09,311",1.75,543,"I am sorry, Mother."
1,6,"00:44:12,066","00:44:13,936",1.87,544,Your father is looking for her.
1,6,"00:44:15,110","00:44:18,200",3.09,545,Your sister will return home soon.
1,6,"00:44:20,616","00:44:22,986",2.37,546,Bring me the yin-and-yang jade from Jinyowon.
1,6,"00:44:25,412","00:44:26,712",1.30,547,The yin-and-yang jade?
1,6,"00:44:26,789","00:44:28,169",1.38,548,You have been wanting that.
1,6,"00:44:29,708","00:44:34,546",4.84,549,"They say when you and your lover wear rings made of that jade, your love for each other deepens."
1,6,"00:44:36,674","00:44:39,684",3.01,550,Craft your wedding rings with it.
1,6,"00:44:41,095","00:44:42,845",1.75,551,"Thank you, Mother."
1,6,"00:45:06,370","00:45:08,750",2.38,552,What an annoying pot.
1,6,"00:45:06,370","00:45:08,750",2.38,553,"It was you, was it not?"
1,6,"00:45:09,248","00:45:10,788",1.54,554,How annoying.
1,6,"00:45:17,756","00:45:21,181",3.43,555,I guess it annoys you that I am getting married.
1,6,"00:45:21,260","00:45:22,300",1.04,556,But wait and see.
1,6,"00:45:22,386","00:45:25,814",3.43,557,I will become even more annoying once I wear a ring made of this jade.
1,6,"00:45:38,110","00:45:39,700",1.59,558,Eat up.
1,6,"00:45:40,696","00:45:41,986",1.29,559,All right.
1,6,"00:45:44,366","00:45:46,866",2.50,560,I had brought home a pheasant earlier.
1,6,"00:45:46,952","00:45:48,912",1.96,561,So why are there only greens?
1,6,"00:45:48,996","00:45:52,001",3.01,562,It is inside-- It is in the soup.
1,6,"00:45:52,082","00:45:53,832",1.75,563,The pheasant was so tiny.
1,6,"00:45:53,917","00:45:55,667",1.75,564,There was not much left after making that broth.
1,6,"00:46:06,597","00:46:08,677",2.08,565,I do get a very faint taste of it.
1,6,"00:46:13,687","00:46:16,477",2.79,566,I overheard this while selling herbs in Songrim.
1,6,"00:46:16,565","00:46:18,935",2.37,567,Two prominent families will be marrying off their kids.
1,6,"00:46:19,526","00:46:21,446",1.92,568,Who will be getting married?
1,6,"00:46:21,528","00:46:24,448",2.92,569,Lady Jin's daughter is getting married.
1,6,"00:46:25,157","00:46:28,197",3.04,570,Cho-yeon is getting married? To whom?
1,6,"00:46:28,285","00:46:30,405",2.12,571,To the son of Cheonbugwan's Gwanju.
1,6,"00:46:32,706","00:46:34,076",1.37,572,Is that not you?
1,6,"00:46:45,010","00:46:48,220",3.21,573,I was never told I was getting married.
1,6,"00:46:45,010","00:46:48,220",3.21,574,What is going on?
1,6,"00:46:48,305","00:46:49,965",1.66,575,What is up Maidservant Kim's sleeve?
1,6,"00:46:50,057","00:46:52,807",2.75,576,Most hastened weddings tend to be shotgun weddings.
1,6,"00:46:52,893","00:46:53,943",1.05,577,That is not true.
1,6,"00:46:54,520","00:46:56,100",1.58,578,You were previously engaged to her.
1,6,"00:46:56,772","00:46:58,362",1.59,579,Maybe you could not control yourself.
1,6,"00:46:58,440","00:47:01,650",3.21,580,How could she be pregnant when we were never this close?
1,6,"00:47:02,486","00:47:04,606",2.12,581,Right. You are all talk.
1,6,"00:47:04,696","00:47:05,856",1.16,582,What?
1,6,"00:47:05,948","00:47:07,818",1.87,583,Then why did you refuse the chaste herb tea?
1,6,"00:47:07,908","00:47:08,908",1.00,584,That is because…
1,6,"00:47:11,328","00:47:12,998",1.67,585,I have plans to marry later on.
1,6,"00:47:14,831","00:47:16,581",1.75,586,You must want to get married one day.
1,6,"00:47:17,876","00:47:19,416",1.54,587,"Yes, I do."
1,6,"00:47:19,503","00:47:20,633",1.13,588,I truly want to.
1,6,"00:47:21,380","00:47:23,920",2.54,589,I will get married at all costs.
1,6,"00:47:24,007","00:47:25,257",1.25,590,Wait up.
1,6,"00:47:40,482","00:47:42,192",1.71,591,Why did you want to see me?
1,6,"00:47:42,985","00:47:46,405",3.42,592,When will the mother-of-pearl cabinet that I ordered from Songrim come?
1,6,"00:47:47,030","00:47:48,280",1.25,593,It is for Uk and me.
1,6,"00:47:48,365","00:47:52,365",4.00,594,The trade from the south will arrive in two weeks.
1,6,"00:47:53,120","00:47:54,410",1.29,595,That will be too late.
1,6,"00:47:55,414","00:47:56,874",1.46,596,I should have ordered sooner.
1,6,"00:47:56,957","00:47:58,827",1.87,597,Forget about the mother-of-pearl cabinet.
1,6,"00:47:59,376","00:48:01,296",1.92,598,You should inform Uk first.
1,6,"00:48:02,629","00:48:03,959",1.33,599,He has no idea about this.
1,6,"00:48:06,049","00:48:08,679",2.63,600,That is why I have written a letter to him.
1,6,"00:48:09,469","00:48:10,929",1.46,601,Read it and share your thoughts.
1,6,"00:48:12,639","00:48:13,769",1.13,602,Sure.
1,6,"00:48:17,477","00:48:18,597",1.12,603,It is fragrant.
1,6,"00:48:18,687","00:48:20,977",2.29,604,This is a perfume that incurs the feeling of love.
1,6,"00:48:21,898","00:48:23,358",1.46,605,A treasure of Jinyowon.
1,6,"00:48:25,110","00:48:27,740",2.63,606,"Gosh, it is very fragrant."
1,6,"00:48:49,551","00:48:51,301",1.75,607,Why are you sniffing it?
1,6,"00:48:51,386","00:48:52,346",0.96,608,Stop that!
1,6,"00:48:53,472","00:48:55,392",1.92,609,Hold your nostrils shut!
1,6,"00:49:07,736","00:49:09,566",1.83,610,I almost wasted the precious perfume.
1,6,"00:49:12,783","00:49:14,493",1.71,611,Please give this to him.
1,6,"00:49:15,077","00:49:18,287",3.21,612,And make sure there are no women around him when he opens it.
1,6,"00:49:21,083","00:49:21,923",0.84,613,I will.
1,6,"00:49:27,255","00:49:28,375",1.12,614,What are you doing?
1,6,"00:49:28,465","00:49:33,135",4.67,615,"Uk's hand size is similar to yours, right?"
1,6,"00:49:35,138","00:49:36,348",1.21,616,Why do you ask?
1,6,"00:49:37,140","00:49:39,640",2.50,617,Come with me to get our wedding rings.
1,6,"00:49:39,726","00:49:41,056",1.33,618,Lend me your hand.
1,6,"00:49:41,812","00:49:44,272",2.46,619,Why would I go there with you?
1,6,"00:49:44,356","00:49:45,516",1.16,620,Go with your groom.
1,6,"00:49:46,566","00:49:50,696",4.13,621,Marriage should only happen when both sides agree to it.
1,6,"00:49:51,321","00:49:54,071",2.75,622,I pity you for being like this.
1,6,"00:49:55,367","00:49:56,197",0.83,623,Why?
1,6,"00:49:57,786","00:49:59,746",1.96,624,Do you think I am getting ahead of myself?
1,6,"00:50:00,455","00:50:02,495",2.04,625,Do you think he will break it off again?
1,6,"00:50:07,462","00:50:13,137",5.68,626,"Whether you are getting ahead of yourself or not, I will help you."
1,6,"00:50:13,969","00:50:15,139",1.17,627,Just make sure it pans out.
1,6,"00:50:20,183","00:50:21,943",1.76,628,And I will lend you my hand.
1,6,"00:50:31,111","00:50:37,580",6.47,629,"Come to think of it, Maidservant Kim was against the idea of me living with the wife's family the last time we discussed marriage with Cho-yeon."
1,6,"00:50:38,952","00:50:42,252",3.30,630,There is only one reason why this is being discussed again.
1,6,"00:50:42,748","00:50:43,958",1.21,631,She wants to save me.
1,6,"00:50:44,541","00:50:49,207",4.67,632,She must have made a deal with the Jin family to avoid your duel with the Crown Prince.
1,6,"00:50:49,296","00:50:51,296",2.00,633,She probably needed Lady Jin's help.
1,6,"00:50:52,758","00:50:56,847",4.09,634,"If that were the case, will you get married?"
1,6,"00:50:58,597","00:51:01,597",3.00,635,"What should I do, Master?"
1,6,"00:50:58,597","00:51:01,597",3.00,636,Should I get married?
1,6,"00:51:03,977","00:51:05,097",1.12,637,Can I?
1,6,"00:51:06,938","00:51:10,648",3.71,638,"If you do, we can no longer stay in Danghyanggok."
1,6,"00:51:11,234","00:51:13,154",1.92,639,Right. I should return home.
1,6,"00:51:13,236","00:51:15,446",2.21,640,"Even still, we cannot have this relationship."
1,6,"00:51:15,530","00:51:18,410",2.88,641,Why not? I can still keep you by my side as my maid.
1,6,"00:51:20,619","00:51:23,289",2.67,642,I have no plans to stay by your side as just a maid.
1,6,"00:51:41,515","00:51:43,135",1.62,643,You can go ahead alone.
1,6,"00:51:43,225","00:51:44,725",1.50,644,I will be at Chwiseonru.
1,6,"00:51:46,061","00:51:49,151",3.09,645,"If you do not pick me up, I will go back alone."
1,6,"00:52:03,870","00:52:05,620",1.75,646,CHWISEONRU
1,6,"00:52:11,086","00:52:12,086",1.00,647,What is going on?
1,6,"00:52:12,170","00:52:13,840",1.67,648,We are from Cheonbugwan.
1,6,"00:52:13,922","00:52:15,802",1.88,649,We were told to escort you.
1,6,"00:52:15,882","00:52:16,722",0.84,650,Let us go.
1,6,"00:52:20,136","00:52:22,056",1.92,651,This is the Crown Prince's sachet.
1,6,"00:52:22,138","00:52:25,808",3.67,652,I have His Royal Highness' protection.
1,6,"00:52:22,138","00:52:25,808",3.67,653,You cannot touch me.
1,6,"00:52:29,020","00:52:31,480",2.46,654,What are you doing? Let me go!
1,6,"00:52:31,565","00:52:33,435",1.87,655,This is the Crown Prince's sachet.
1,6,"00:52:45,453","00:52:47,663",2.21,656,We brought her from Chwiseonru like he wanted.
1,6,"00:52:48,290","00:52:50,080",1.79,657,Chwiseonru?
1,6,"00:52:58,884","00:53:01,304",2.42,658,"The girl you wanted is here, Your Royal Highness."
1,6,"00:53:01,928","00:53:03,048",1.12,659,Where?
1,6,"00:53:06,766","00:53:07,846",1.08,660,Over here.
1,6,"00:53:10,186","00:53:11,146",0.96,661,Her?
1,6,"00:53:11,688","00:53:13,268",1.58,662,Lift your head up.
1,6,"00:53:29,623","00:53:31,253",1.63,663,Why are you dressed like that?
1,6,"00:53:31,833","00:53:33,343",1.51,664,I do not know.
1,6,"00:53:33,877","00:53:37,087",3.21,665,She did this to me after I was dragged here.
1,6,"00:53:38,048","00:53:40,218",2.17,666,Did you do that?
1,6,"00:53:40,300","00:53:44,511",4.21,667,Is she not the gisaeng from Chwiseonru?
1,6,"00:53:45,680","00:53:46,850",1.17,668,"No, she is not."
1,6,"00:53:48,391","00:53:50,811",2.42,669,She is Filthy Mu-deok.
1,6,"00:53:48,391","00:53:50,811",2.42,670,Filthy?
1,6,"00:53:52,896","00:53:54,146",1.25,671,Get out.
1,6,"00:53:55,065","00:53:56,315",1.25,672,Go.
1,6,"00:53:59,444","00:54:00,704",1.26,673,Look at you.
1,6,"00:54:04,908","00:54:06,908",2.00,674,Why did you want to see me?
1,6,"00:54:06,993","00:54:10,833",3.84,675,"I had something to tell you, so I told them to get you."
1,6,"00:54:10,914","00:54:12,924",2.01,676,But you are not Filthy Mu-deok right now.
1,6,"00:54:12,999","00:54:14,629",1.63,677,Filth and silk do not go hand in hand.
1,6,"00:54:15,335","00:54:17,915",2.58,678,"Maybe in your dictionary, it does."
1,6,"00:54:18,964","00:54:20,344",1.38,679,Did you just snap at me?
1,6,"00:54:20,423","00:54:21,973",1.55,680,"No, Your Royal Highness."
1,6,"00:54:22,050","00:54:25,010",2.96,681,I am grateful that you dressed someone as filthy as me in silk.
1,6,"00:54:26,638","00:54:33,138",6.50,682,All right. This new look… does not suit you.
1,6,"00:54:35,939","00:54:40,744",4.81,683,"Since you do not like it and I am uncomfortable in this, let me go get changed."
1,6,"00:54:40,819","00:54:41,899",1.08,684,No.
1,6,"00:54:43,071","00:54:45,661",2.59,685,It is all right. Just keep it on.
1,6,"00:54:48,118","00:54:52,208",4.09,686,"Tell me what you want, and I will do it."
1,6,"00:54:52,288","00:54:56,498",4.21,687,Tell your young master not to show up that day.
1,6,"00:54:57,669","00:55:02,257",4.59,688,I do not want to kill him and become enemies with Songrim or the Jang family.
1,6,"00:55:02,966","00:55:05,256",2.29,689,"It is best that he fled, and let us keep it that way."
1,6,"00:55:06,803","00:55:09,263",2.46,690,So he just needs to be the laughingstock.
1,6,"00:55:09,931","00:55:10,971",1.04,691,That is right.
1,6,"00:55:11,599","00:55:14,889",3.29,692,"If he becomes stubborn, dissuade him."
1,6,"00:55:14,978","00:55:16,898",1.92,693,He will die if he fights me.
1,6,"00:55:19,482","00:55:22,612",3.13,694,"Tell him to stay hidden, then get married to the Jin family."
1,6,"00:55:23,903","00:55:26,993",3.09,695,So it is true that getting married will save his life.
1,6,"00:55:29,743","00:55:32,043",2.30,696,What will happen to you if he gets married?
1,6,"00:55:32,120","00:55:33,250",1.13,697,Will you go with him?
1,6,"00:55:33,913","00:55:35,213",1.30,698,"No, I will not."
1,6,"00:55:35,832","00:55:38,502",2.67,699,Why not? Did he refuse?
1,6,"00:55:40,920","00:55:43,800",2.88,700,You were even willing to drink filthy chamber pot water for him.
1,6,"00:55:43,882","00:55:46,973",3.09,701,He knows neither loyalty nor duty.
1,6,"00:55:48,178","00:55:52,388",4.21,702,"He does know a bit, Your Royal Highness."
1,6,"00:55:52,474","00:55:54,894",2.42,703,Are you taking his side?
1,6,"00:55:52,474","00:55:54,894",2.42,704,You were always bad-mouthing him.
1,6,"00:55:54,976","00:55:56,766",1.79,705,"I am sorry, Your Royal Highness."
1,6,"00:55:57,729","00:56:00,019",2.29,706,It would please you if I bad-mouthed him.
1,6,"00:56:00,857","00:56:04,607",3.75,707,But I have no energy to run my mouth right now.
1,6,"00:56:06,154","00:56:08,784",2.63,708,You are a filthy mutt who will be abandoned by its owner.
1,6,"00:56:20,126","00:56:21,166",1.04,709,Should I take you in?
1,6,"00:56:23,296","00:56:24,546",1.25,710,I can do that.
1,6,"00:56:25,131","00:56:27,431",2.30,711,There must be things you can do here too.
1,6,"00:56:28,760","00:56:29,640",0.88,712,"No, thank you."
1,6,"00:56:31,054","00:56:37,306",6.25,713,"I may be a filthy girl whom everyone avoids, but I refuse to serve just anyone."
1,6,"00:56:40,814","00:56:43,444",2.63,714,Forget it. I do not want someone filthy by my side either.
1,6,"00:56:44,067","00:56:46,107",2.04,715,You may leave.
1,6,"00:56:44,067","00:56:46,107",2.04,716,"Yes, Your Royal Highness."
1,6,"00:56:51,658","00:56:55,035",3.38,717,"I will go now, Your Royal Highness."
1,6,"00:57:04,587","00:57:05,957",1.37,718,"""Just anyone""?"
1,6,"00:57:07,298","00:57:08,588",1.29,719,But I am the Crown Prince.
1,6,"00:57:08,675","00:57:12,300",3.62,720,Filthy Mu-deok does not know to whom she is speaking.
1,6,"00:57:29,779","00:57:32,529",2.75,721,Be gentle. Take your time.
1,6,"00:57:29,779","00:57:32,529",2.75,722,"Yes, ma'am."
1,6,"00:57:34,659","00:57:35,489",0.83,723,Maidservant Kim.
1,6,"00:57:36,911","00:57:37,791",0.88,724,How have you been?
1,6,"00:57:39,038","00:57:40,118",1.08,725,Young Master!
1,6,"00:57:40,748","00:57:42,248",1.50,726,My dear Young Master!
1,6,"00:57:44,252","00:57:46,132",1.88,727,Young Master!
1,6,"00:57:44,252","00:57:46,132",1.88,728,Were you worried?
1,6,"00:57:46,212","00:57:47,422",1.21,729,Have you been eating well?
1,6,"00:57:47,505","00:57:49,125",1.62,730,"Yes, I have. I have been well."
1,6,"00:57:49,215","00:57:50,675",1.46,731,Goodness.
1,6,"00:57:50,758","00:57:52,258",1.50,732,Your skin is radiating.
1,6,"00:57:52,343","00:57:53,473",1.13,733,"Oh, please."
1,6,"00:57:53,553","00:57:54,853",1.30,734,Let us go inside.
1,6,"00:57:58,516","00:58:00,346",1.83,735,Was she the one who tried to sell…
1,6,"00:58:03,021","00:58:04,401",1.38,736,Songrim's Spirit Plaque?
1,6,"00:58:12,322","00:58:14,412",2.09,737,It was not me. It was Mu-deok.
1,6,"00:58:15,200","00:58:17,410",2.21,738,Mu-deok tried to sell Uk's Spirit Plaque?
1,6,"00:58:17,494","00:58:19,754",2.26,739,I just introduced her to the seller.
1,6,"00:58:19,829","00:58:21,829",2.00,740,"In the end, Ae-hyang snatched it herself."
1,6,"00:58:21,915","00:58:23,875",1.96,741,So Mu-deok and I are innocent.
1,6,"00:58:41,601","00:58:42,891",1.29,742,What is this?
1,6,"00:58:44,270","00:58:46,520",2.25,743,Why are you dressed like that?
1,6,"00:58:47,273","00:58:48,983",1.71,744,It is a long story.
1,6,"00:58:49,067","00:58:51,817",2.75,745,Have you returned to Chwiseonru?
1,6,"00:58:52,695","00:58:54,945",2.25,746,Did Uk send you back since he is getting married?
1,6,"00:58:55,031","00:58:56,321",1.29,747,"No, Young Master Seo."
1,6,"00:58:56,407","00:59:00,327",3.92,748,"Even if that was the case, I would never come back here."
1,6,"00:59:00,411","00:59:04,207",3.80,749,Ju-wol finally caved in and told me that you tried to sell Uk's Spirit Plaque.
1,6,"00:59:07,544","00:59:09,384",1.84,750,"Yes, I did."
1,6,"00:59:10,255","00:59:11,165",0.91,751,Why?
1,6,"00:59:12,298","00:59:14,048",1.75,752,Because I needed money.
1,6,"00:59:14,133","00:59:19,428",5.30,753,"I wanted to wear pretty clothes, have good food, and have fun at places like this."
1,6,"00:59:19,514","00:59:23,024",3.51,754,Was that the case when you were drunk last time?
1,6,"00:59:23,935","00:59:27,185",3.25,755,That is correct. I stole Young Master Jang's money and drank.
1,6,"00:59:31,776","00:59:33,816",2.04,756,I am just so puzzled by you.
1,6,"00:59:35,530","00:59:38,030",2.50,757,I cannot understand you.
1,6,"00:59:41,452","00:59:43,752",2.30,758,You do not need to.
1,6,"00:59:43,830","00:59:45,620",1.79,759,Just stay that way.
1,6,"00:59:47,709","00:59:49,339",1.63,760,I am going inside.
1,6,"00:59:49,419","00:59:51,089",1.67,761,Would you like to come with me?
1,6,"00:59:51,879","00:59:52,799",0.92,762,That is all right.
1,6,"00:59:54,048","00:59:55,168",1.12,763,"Goodbye, then."
1,6,"01:00:00,847","01:00:04,477",3.63,764,CHWISEONRU
1,6,"01:00:08,354","01:00:09,814",1.46,765,The Spirit Plaque…
1,6,"01:00:11,190","01:00:14,360",3.17,766,"So it was you, Naksu."
1,6,"01:00:24,495","01:00:25,615",1.12,767,Young Master.
1,6,"01:00:27,415","01:00:29,415",2.00,768,Why do you not want to get married?
1,6,"01:00:31,252","01:00:32,802",1.55,769,Do you dislike Young Lady Jin?
1,6,"01:00:32,879","01:00:35,209",2.33,770,It is not that I dislike her.
1,6,"01:00:36,257","01:00:38,127",1.87,771,I am just not interested.
1,6,"01:00:38,760","01:00:40,890",2.13,772,"You have feelings for someone else, do you not?"
1,6,"01:00:42,263","01:00:43,473",1.21,773,Who is it?
1,6,"01:00:44,057","01:00:45,557",1.50,774,Do I know her?
1,6,"01:00:46,559","01:00:48,599",2.04,775,"No, you do not."
1,6,"01:00:49,187","01:00:50,397",1.21,776,So there is one.
1,6,"01:00:50,480","01:00:51,730",1.25,777,I knew it.
1,6,"01:00:51,814","01:00:52,864",1.05,778,Who is she?
1,6,"01:00:54,400","01:00:55,440",1.04,779,Well…
1,6,"01:00:55,526","01:00:58,446",2.92,780,She is like a single bird egg on top of a tree.
1,6,"01:00:59,072","01:01:02,622",3.55,781,"I am the only one she has, so how could I possibly get married?"
1,6,"01:01:02,700","01:01:05,620",2.92,782,Those kinds of girls are the most dangerous!
1,6,"01:01:05,703","01:01:07,963",2.26,783,Those who have nothing to brag about but are just clingy!
1,6,"01:01:08,039","01:01:09,539",1.50,784,She is not like that.
1,6,"01:01:09,624","01:01:12,094",2.47,785,Who is she? Tell me this instant.
1,6,"01:01:12,168","01:01:13,458",1.29,786,I will take care of it.
1,6,"01:01:13,544","01:01:14,714",1.17,787,Exactly how?
1,6,"01:01:14,796","01:01:19,930",5.13,788,"Once I give her a silk pouch full of money, she will crack out of her egg and fly away."
1,6,"01:01:20,009","01:01:23,429",3.42,789,She cannot fly anywhere.
1,6,"01:01:20,009","01:01:23,429",3.42,790,It is not that easy.
1,6,"01:01:24,722","01:01:26,852",2.13,791,"In any case, I cannot get married."
1,6,"01:01:26,933","01:01:28,143",1.21,792,So take care of it for me.
1,6,"01:01:29,102","01:01:31,272",2.17,793,"You better take care of it, got that?"
1,6,"01:01:32,063","01:01:33,403",1.34,794,Young Master.
1,6,"01:01:35,900","01:01:38,610",2.71,795,What is wrong? Are you hurt?
1,6,"01:01:38,695","01:01:39,945",1.25,796,Let me see.
1,6,"01:01:42,115","01:01:44,025",1.91,797,What happened to your arm?
1,6,"01:01:45,827","01:01:47,497",1.67,798,Did it get out of control again?
1,6,"01:01:54,711","01:01:56,341",1.63,799,Please sell that dress.
1,6,"01:01:56,421","01:02:00,051",3.63,800,"It is made of silk, so make it worth it."
1,6,"01:01:56,421","01:02:00,051",3.63,801,All right.
1,6,"01:02:00,633","01:02:03,093",2.46,802,Our madam is tending to a customer at the moment.
1,6,"01:02:03,177","01:02:04,887",1.71,803,Young Lady Jin from Jinyowon is here.
1,6,"01:02:05,638","01:02:09,178",3.54,804,She is looking for someone who can craft her wedding rings.
1,6,"01:02:09,267","01:02:11,097",1.83,805,She is marrying a young master from Songrim.
1,6,"01:02:15,064","01:02:17,324",2.26,806,Then how about this one?
1,6,"01:02:20,319","01:02:24,029",3.71,807,These are the works of Daeho's best craftsmen?
1,6,"01:02:25,825","01:02:28,695",2.87,808,They are stylish but a bit tacky.
1,6,"01:02:30,329","01:02:32,579",2.25,809,Then may I see the yin-and-yang jade?
1,6,"01:02:32,665","01:02:35,325",2.66,810,Seeing it for myself will help me give you better recommendations.
1,6,"01:02:40,173","01:02:44,758",4.59,811,"They say when you and your lover wear rings made of that, your love for each other deepens."
1,6,"01:02:58,983","01:03:00,693",1.71,812,Why did the jade break?
1,6,"01:03:01,527","01:03:03,907",2.38,813,It was fine when I took it with me.
1,6,"01:03:09,702","01:03:12,412",2.71,814,I see. That is when it broke.
1,6,"01:03:15,416","01:03:16,496",1.08,815,Mu-deok.
1,6,"01:03:23,174","01:03:24,434",1.26,816,Young Lady Jin.
1,6,"01:03:25,009","01:03:27,299",2.29,817,Why are you suddenly leaving?
1,6,"01:03:27,386","01:03:30,466",3.08,818,That is Mu-deok. Is Uk here as well?
1,6,"01:03:30,556","01:03:31,766",1.21,819,No.
1,6,"01:03:33,100","01:03:35,730",2.63,820,I see.
1,6,"01:03:33,100","01:03:37,612",4.51,821,"Since they are attached at the hip, he must be somewhere in the fortress."
1,6,"01:03:37,688","01:03:39,478",1.79,822,Attached at the hip?
1,6,"01:03:39,565","01:03:41,275",1.71,823,"As his maid, she is serving him."
1,6,"01:03:42,401","01:03:43,821",1.42,824,Watch what you say.
1,6,"01:03:45,279","01:03:48,869",3.59,825,Mu-deok is not just any ordinary maid to him.
1,6,"01:03:50,034","01:03:53,504",3.47,826,He came by to pick Mu-deok up when she was drunk recently.
1,6,"01:03:54,163","01:03:55,963",1.80,827,He adores her so much.
1,6,"01:03:56,040","01:03:58,540",2.50,828,He even carried her on his back.
1,6,"01:03:59,210","01:04:03,921",4.71,829,It is obvious that he picked her from the get-go because she won his heart.
1,6,"01:04:04,465","01:04:07,755",3.29,830,Is Mu-deok from here? Was she a gisaeng?
1,6,"01:04:07,844","01:04:09,304",1.46,831,She is one poor girl.
1,6,"01:04:09,971","01:04:13,271",3.30,832,No wonder he cares about her so much.
1,6,"01:04:27,613","01:04:28,663",1.05,833,Hey.
1,6,"01:04:29,282","01:04:31,082",1.80,834,"You know who I am, right?"
1,6,"01:04:32,451","01:04:34,581",2.13,835,"Of course, I do."
1,6,"01:04:34,662","01:04:37,122",2.46,836,You are Young Lady Jin from Jinyowon.
1,6,"01:04:39,125","01:04:42,245",3.12,837,"You will have to address me as ""Lady"" soon."
1,6,"01:04:43,462","01:04:47,132",3.67,838,Because I will marry your young master soon.
1,6,"01:04:48,676","01:04:51,386",2.71,839,"Goodness. Congratulations, my lady."
1,6,"01:04:51,470","01:04:54,680",3.21,840,"As your master's wife, you will serve me too."
1,6,"01:04:56,100","01:04:57,640",1.54,841,There is something you must do.
1,6,"01:04:59,896","01:05:01,606",1.71,842,"First, carry this."
1,6,"01:05:02,648","01:05:04,278",1.63,843,What is this?
1,6,"01:05:11,115","01:05:12,405",1.29,844,What was that?
1,6,"01:05:13,576","01:05:15,236",1.66,845,A broken stone?
1,6,"01:05:17,830","01:05:20,250",2.42,846,It is a precious object.
1,6,"01:05:20,333","01:05:24,593",4.26,847,"If it breaks or cracks, you will have to take responsibility."
1,6,"01:05:25,713","01:05:28,383",2.67,848,Is she saying that when it is already broken?
1,6,"01:05:29,300","01:05:30,340",1.04,849,Take that and follow me.
1,6,"01:05:31,594","01:05:32,724",1.13,850,My lady.
1,6,"01:05:33,471","01:05:35,311",1.84,851,You are not someone I must serve yet.
1,6,"01:05:35,932","01:05:38,642",2.71,852,I must go to Young Master Jang now. Goodbye.
1,6,"01:05:42,939","01:05:45,479",2.54,853,Is she looking down on me?
1,6,"01:05:53,240","01:05:55,790",2.55,854,Was that real back there?
1,6,"01:06:06,379","01:06:08,759",2.38,855,It is best that I do not cross paths with him.
1,6,"01:06:10,883","01:06:12,933",2.05,856,Hey! You!
1,6,"01:06:15,012","01:06:15,932",0.92,857,The dangerous man?
1,6,"01:06:17,765","01:06:19,225",1.46,858,Or this mean brat?
1,6,"01:06:20,810","01:06:21,890",1.08,859,My lady.
1,6,"01:06:22,687","01:06:25,057",2.37,860,Give that to me. I will carry it.
1,6,"01:06:28,275","01:06:29,395",1.12,861,Sure.
1,6,"01:06:29,485","01:06:32,025",2.54,862,Make sure you do not break it.
1,6,"01:06:36,617","01:06:38,117",1.50,863,So it is broken.
1,6,"01:06:38,703","01:06:40,913",2.21,864,She is going to put the blame on me.
1,6,"01:07:09,817","01:07:11,817",2.00,865,Is this the Jin family's abode?
1,6,"01:07:44,602","01:07:46,062",1.46,866,Why are you not coming?
1,6,"01:07:58,324","01:07:59,374",1.05,867,Mother.
1,6,"01:08:21,055","01:08:22,675",1.62,868,You cannot leave like this.
1,6,"01:08:23,974","01:08:27,354",3.38,869,Say that you will marry her in front of your late mother's portrait.
1,6,"01:08:27,436","01:08:29,976",2.54,870,That is the only way to protect your father's position.
1,6,"01:08:32,399","01:08:33,729",1.33,871,Maidservant Kim.
1,6,"01:08:33,818","01:08:38,200",4.38,872,Do you think I really am my father's son?
1,6,"01:08:41,742","01:08:46,081",4.34,873,Do you know who my real father is?
1,6,"01:08:47,748","01:08:49,418",1.67,874,What do you mean?
1,6,"01:08:50,334","01:08:52,554",2.22,875,You are Gwanju Jang Gang's son.
1,6,"01:08:54,463","01:08:56,673",2.21,876,Yes. That is what I believed all my life.
1,6,"01:08:56,757","01:08:58,587",1.83,877,I do not want to deny it now.
1,6,"01:08:58,676","01:08:59,636",0.96,878,So…
1,6,"01:09:01,720","01:09:03,720",2.00,879,I will not sit still.
1,6,"01:09:05,182","01:09:09,015",3.83,880,Do not stop me no matter what I do.
1,6,"01:09:17,027","01:09:20,157",3.13,881,"Maidservant Kim, the Jin family sent someone."
1,6,"01:09:20,739","01:09:23,079",2.34,882,From Jinyowon? What is it about?
1,6,"01:09:23,159","01:09:24,619",1.46,883,Something happened there.
1,6,"01:09:25,494","01:09:28,584",3.09,884,They want Young Master Jang to hurry over.
1,6,"01:10:09,455","01:10:10,745",1.29,885,You were looking for me?
1,6,"01:10:10,831","01:10:12,121",1.29,886,What is this about?
1,6,"01:10:12,708","01:10:15,418",2.71,887,A precious treasure of ours has disappeared.
1,6,"01:10:16,212","01:10:20,802",4.59,888,And an individual has disappeared with it.
1,6,"01:10:28,140","01:10:30,890",2.75,889,So this is Jinyowon.
1,6,"01:10:39,360","01:10:40,440",1.08,890,Hey.
1,6,"01:10:47,701","01:10:49,201",1.50,891,So it is you.
1,6,"01:10:53,332","01:10:54,922",1.59,892,It has been a long time.
1,6,"01:11:25,197","01:11:30,036",4.84,893,You are saying Mu-deok -disappeared here?
1,6,"01:11:27,366","01:11:30,036",2.67,894,Yes.
1,6,"01:11:30,619","01:11:35,166",4.55,895,"Your maid, Mu-deok, stole our yin-and-yang jade and ran away."
