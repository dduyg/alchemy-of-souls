1,2,"00:00:36,619","00:00:39,709",3.09,1,20 YEARS AGO
1,2,"00:00:41,468","00:00:43,138",1.67,2,My lady…
1,2,"00:00:45,628","00:00:47,508",1.88,3,My lady…
1,2,"00:00:56,181","00:00:57,721",1.54,4,My lady…
1,2,"00:01:01,644","00:01:03,774",2.13,5,I shall make Do-hwa mine.
1,2,"00:01:03,855","00:01:06,475",2.62,6,"If she bears a child, know that it is mine."
1,2,"00:01:12,530","00:01:14,280",1.75,7,My lady…
1,2,"00:01:15,200","00:01:16,530",1.33,8,My lord.
1,2,"00:01:16,618","00:01:18,198",1.58,9,"Where are you going, my lord?"
1,2,"00:01:28,880","00:01:30,590",1.71,10,I heard about Do-hwa.
1,2,"00:01:31,174","00:01:32,804",1.63,11,We were just about to head over.
1,2,"00:01:32,884","00:01:36,814",3.93,12,Why are you here when you should be mourning her?
1,2,"00:01:37,514","00:01:40,564",3.05,13,I came here because this was the only way to change his fate.
1,2,"00:02:00,120","00:02:01,120",1.00,14,What are you doing?
1,2,"00:02:27,230","00:02:29,150",1.92,15,What have you done?
1,2,"00:02:29,232","00:02:31,282",2.05,16,I have blocked his gate of energy.
1,2,"00:02:32,110","00:02:34,570",2.46,17,He will not be able to learn any spells while he is alive.
1,2,"00:02:37,740","00:02:41,160",3.42,18,I forbid anyone from opening his gate of energy!
1,2,"00:02:41,911","00:02:45,921",4.01,19,How could you do this to your son?
1,2,"00:02:47,834","00:02:49,044",1.21,20,My son?
1,2,"00:02:58,344","00:03:00,514",2.17,21,Why would he decide my own fate?
1,2,"00:03:01,806","00:03:04,016",2.21,22,No one even considers him as my true father anyway!
1,2,"00:03:04,809","00:03:05,979",1.17,23,I will find someone.
1,2,"00:03:06,603","00:03:10,521",3.92,24,A master who will open my gate of energy and teach me how to practice spells.
1,2,"00:03:11,482","00:03:13,322",1.84,25,I will find someone myself.
1,2,"00:03:14,569","00:03:17,029",2.46,26,Then I will take out that sword and break it in two.
1,2,"00:03:22,201","00:03:26,041",3.84,27,I have met a total of 12 masters and have been kicked out every time.
1,2,"00:03:27,832","00:03:31,252",3.42,28,"And finally, I have met the master who will change my fate."
1,2,"00:03:42,889","00:03:44,719",1.83,29,I knew the moment I saw you.
1,2,"00:03:46,476","00:03:47,846",1.37,30,You are my master.
1,2,"00:03:58,738","00:04:03,407",4.67,31,"Did you find something special about me, Young Master?"
1,2,"00:04:06,371","00:04:08,251",1.88,32,I told you that you have beautiful eyes.
1,2,"00:04:08,331","00:04:10,671",2.34,33,"Right, sorry."
1,2,"00:04:08,331","00:04:10,671",2.34,34,Only your eyes are beautiful.
1,2,"00:04:12,335","00:04:14,835",2.50,35,The soul shifter's blue mark has bloomed inside them.
1,2,"00:04:16,589","00:04:18,509",1.92,36,So the mark was inside my eyes.
1,2,"00:04:22,887","00:04:24,177",1.29,37,You are going to fight me?
1,2,"00:04:24,264","00:04:25,974",1.71,38,Killing you would be a breeze.
1,2,"00:04:26,557","00:04:27,847",1.29,39,But this is Songrim.
1,2,"00:04:28,601","00:04:30,021",1.42,40,You will get caught.
1,2,"00:04:42,532","00:04:44,622",2.09,41,I am planning to save you.
1,2,"00:04:44,701","00:04:47,751",3.05,42,You will not get caught if you stay by my side.
1,2,"00:05:01,718","00:05:03,928",2.21,43,How should you address me if you want to lie low?
1,2,"00:05:06,431","00:05:21,903",15.47,44,"""Young Master."" Jang Uk?"
1,2,"00:05:22,572","00:05:23,782",1.21,45,"Yes, it is me."
1,2,"00:05:24,282","00:05:25,742",1.46,46,Why are you here?
1,2,"00:05:29,495","00:05:30,535",1.04,47,And who is she?
1,2,"00:05:31,914","00:05:32,754",0.84,48,Right.
1,2,"00:05:34,042","00:05:36,002",1.96,49,"She is Mu-deok, my maid."
1,2,"00:05:38,629","00:05:39,839",1.21,50,Mu-deok?
1,2,"00:05:42,508","00:05:46,758",4.25,51,"Yul, you startled her."
1,2,"00:05:42,508","00:05:46,758",4.25,52,Can you put your blade down?
1,2,"00:05:47,638","00:05:48,768",1.13,53,Right.
1,2,"00:05:51,601","00:05:53,521",1.92,54,"Mu-deok, are you all right?"
1,2,"00:05:56,397","00:05:57,437",1.04,55,Mu-deok.
1,2,"00:05:59,901","00:06:01,821",1.92,56,"I am fine, Young Master."
1,2,"00:06:02,403","00:06:03,323",0.92,57,Good.
1,2,"00:06:04,280","00:06:05,360",1.08,58,Uk?
1,2,"00:06:06,157","00:06:07,077",0.92,59,Hey.
1,2,"00:06:08,409","00:06:10,999",2.59,60,Hold on. Why are you here?
1,2,"00:06:11,079","00:06:14,619",3.54,61,I came to visit the leader.
1,2,"00:06:11,079","00:06:14,619",3.54,62,We took refuge here after hearing a fight.
1,2,"00:06:15,333","00:06:18,133",2.80,63,There were intruders.
1,2,"00:06:15,333","00:06:18,133",2.80,64,You cannot even fight.
1,2,"00:06:18,211","00:06:21,091",2.88,65,Jeez. Thank goodness they did not spot you.
1,2,"00:06:21,172","00:06:22,632",1.46,66,No.
1,2,"00:06:22,715","00:06:25,045",2.33,67,It was wise of you to hide here.
1,2,"00:06:25,134","00:06:28,354",3.22,68,"My maid ran away, so I just followed her, you…"
1,2,"00:06:28,429","00:06:29,679",1.25,69,"Gosh, that hurts…"
1,2,"00:06:30,431","00:06:32,141",1.71,70,Who is she?
1,2,"00:06:37,188","00:06:38,518",1.33,71,What is with that blade?
1,2,"00:06:45,238","00:06:46,068",0.83,72,You…
1,2,"00:06:49,283","00:06:51,203",1.92,73,Were you trying to protect him with that?
1,2,"00:06:52,161","00:06:53,961",1.80,74,I am proud of you.
1,2,"00:06:54,038","00:06:59,336",5.30,75,"That is right. Your young master is extremely weak, so you need to protect him."
1,2,"00:07:01,504","00:07:02,674",1.17,76,Of course.
1,2,"00:07:02,755","00:07:04,965",2.21,77,I ought to protect my young master.
1,2,"00:07:06,008","00:07:08,298",2.29,78,"No, that is not true."
1,2,"00:07:09,554","00:07:12,354",2.80,79,I should protect you instead.
1,2,"00:07:13,808","00:07:15,138",1.33,80,What is with the strong grip?
1,2,"00:07:15,893","00:07:16,983",1.09,81,Let go.
1,2,"00:07:25,027","00:07:28,567",3.54,82,Mudeoki! You should not glare like that!
1,2,"00:07:29,282","00:07:30,492",1.21,83,You should look down.
1,2,"00:07:32,994","00:07:35,374",2.38,84,"Yes, Young Master."
1,2,"00:07:36,664","00:07:38,924",2.26,85,So you were the one who ran away from me.
1,2,"00:07:39,000","00:07:40,330",1.33,86,"Mu-deok, was it?"
1,2,"00:07:41,294","00:07:42,804",1.51,87,I am sorry to have startled you.
1,2,"00:07:55,099","00:07:56,679",1.58,88,Are you injured?
1,2,"00:08:09,530","00:08:10,570",1.04,89,Mu-deok.
1,2,"00:08:11,449","00:08:13,949",2.50,90,"I am fine, Young Master."
1,2,"00:08:16,954","00:08:19,044",2.09,91,Has the dust settled?
1,2,"00:08:16,954","00:08:19,044",2.09,92,No.
1,2,"00:08:19,123","00:08:20,293",1.17,93,It is still chaotic.
1,2,"00:08:20,875","00:08:22,835",1.96,94,Soul Shifter Naksu's body has gone missing.
1,2,"00:08:24,170","00:08:26,800",2.63,95,I knew it. They were the Danju's men.
1,2,"00:08:26,881","00:08:29,511",2.63,96,"Now, I just need to get out of here safely."
1,2,"00:08:30,218","00:08:31,968",1.75,97,What a pity.
1,2,"00:08:32,720","00:08:33,970",1.25,98,The soul shifter.
1,2,"00:08:34,055","00:08:36,095",2.04,99,"Naksu, the Shadow Assassin."
1,2,"00:08:37,350","00:08:40,900",3.55,100,I was always curious about how she looked.
1,2,"00:08:43,022","00:08:45,322",2.30,101,He knows who I am.
1,2,"00:08:45,399","00:08:47,649",2.25,102,I must kill him before I leave.
1,2,"00:08:52,281","00:08:55,371",3.09,103,They must have broken the pine forest barrier and gone out.
1,2,"00:09:08,673","00:09:10,473",1.80,104,So they broke the barrier.
1,2,"00:09:10,550","00:09:12,890",2.34,105,We will go after them.
1,2,"00:09:10,550","00:09:12,890",2.34,106,It is too late.
1,2,"00:09:14,428","00:09:16,928",2.50,107,Only those of Songrim can break the barrier.
1,2,"00:09:18,057","00:09:19,807",1.75,108,There is a spy among us.
1,2,"00:09:21,519","00:09:23,729",2.21,109,We must ask the Jin family for help.
1,2,"00:09:30,403","00:09:33,493",3.09,110,Naksu's body was in this secret room.
1,2,"00:09:34,574","00:09:37,994",3.42,111,"Uk, did you notice anything suspicious while hiding in Jeongjingak?"
1,2,"00:09:38,077","00:09:39,617",1.54,112,Suspicious?
1,2,"00:09:39,704","00:09:42,464",2.76,113,No. I was only watching Mu-deok.
1,2,"00:09:46,919","00:09:51,968",5.05,114,Do you think Naksu shifted her soul into another woman's body and came to retrieve her body?
1,2,"00:09:55,845","00:09:58,255",2.41,115,Can women only shift souls to the same gender?
1,2,"00:09:58,347","00:09:59,467",1.12,116,Not really.
1,2,"00:09:59,557","00:10:03,137",3.58,117,"But for everything to go smoothly, I heard they should pick someone similar."
1,2,"00:10:03,227","00:10:06,017",2.79,118,"Gender, age, and build."
1,2,"00:10:03,227","00:10:06,017",2.79,119,They all need to be similar.
1,2,"00:10:07,940","00:10:09,530",1.59,120,I am only asking because I have not seen her.
1,2,"00:10:09,609","00:10:13,649",4.04,121,Was Naksu thin with short limbs?
1,2,"00:10:13,738","00:10:16,408",2.67,122,Did she have a round face like Mu-deok right here?
1,2,"00:10:16,490","00:10:18,330",1.84,123,What the hell is his problem?
1,2,"00:10:20,911","00:10:24,461",3.55,124,"If that was the case, she would not have been nicknamed ""Naksu""."
1,2,"00:10:24,540","00:10:25,420",0.88,125,Look at her.
1,2,"00:10:26,208","00:10:28,958",2.75,126,What kind of an assassin looks this adorable?
1,2,"00:10:29,837","00:10:30,837",1.00,127,You are right.
1,2,"00:10:30,921","00:10:33,171",2.25,128,I bet she was a monster.
1,2,"00:10:33,257","00:10:35,427",2.17,129,"No, she was human."
1,2,"00:10:37,303","00:10:40,353",3.05,130,"Let us not belittle the dead, even if she was an assassin."
1,2,"00:10:46,270","00:10:48,310",2.04,131,Master Heo Yeom wants to see you.
1,2,"00:10:48,397","00:10:50,357",1.96,132,Go without me. He dislikes me anyway.
1,2,"00:10:50,441","00:10:52,151",1.71,133,Right. Being here would be safer.
1,2,"00:10:52,234","00:10:53,404",1.17,134,Let us go.
1,2,"00:11:04,872","00:11:06,622",1.75,135,The body was frozen here.
1,2,"00:11:06,707","00:11:10,497",3.79,136,"Seeing how there is no rotting smell, your body must still be fine."
1,2,"00:11:12,463","00:11:13,513",1.05,137,Naksu.
1,2,"00:11:15,132","00:11:16,302",1.17,138,That is right.
1,2,"00:11:17,134","00:11:19,474",2.34,139,I am the Shadow Assassin.
1,2,"00:11:22,181","00:11:23,471",1.29,140,Naksu.
1,2,"00:11:28,187","00:11:30,397",2.21,141,I thought long and hard about why you helped me.
1,2,"00:11:32,650","00:11:34,490",1.84,142,Did the Danju send you too?
1,2,"00:11:34,568","00:11:36,988",2.42,143,No. No one sent me here.
1,2,"00:11:37,071","00:11:38,991",1.92,144,Then why did you help me?
1,2,"00:11:39,073","00:11:42,453",3.38,145,"I already told you, but I guess you did not get the message."
1,2,"00:11:45,204","00:11:46,544",1.34,146,You have beautiful eyes.
1,2,"00:11:47,289","00:11:51,094",3.81,147,Do not tell me you really fell for me.
1,2,"00:11:53,379","00:11:54,419",1.04,148,Do not laugh.
1,2,"00:11:55,005","00:11:57,165",2.16,149,That is the only thing that makes sense.
1,2,"00:11:57,258","00:11:59,178",1.92,150,I do admit repeatedly calling you pretty.
1,2,"00:12:00,177","00:12:02,007",1.83,151,But it was because I desired something.
1,2,"00:12:02,638","00:12:03,808",1.17,152,Which was?
1,2,"00:12:04,473","00:12:08,773",4.30,153,I have been searching for someone who can break this spell to call my master.
1,2,"00:12:09,562","00:12:11,022",1.46,154,"And then, I found you."
1,2,"00:12:13,023","00:12:14,113",1.09,155,Naksu.
1,2,"00:12:14,900","00:12:16,860",1.96,156,I want you to be my master.
1,2,"00:12:32,793","00:12:33,923",1.13,157,I heard.
1,2,"00:12:34,003","00:12:36,053",2.05,158,You borrowed the Jin family's ghost Sapsali?
1,2,"00:12:36,130","00:12:37,090",0.96,159,"Yes, my lord."
1,2,"00:12:37,673","00:12:41,143",3.47,160,Are you certain that thing is in Songrim?
1,2,"00:12:41,218","00:12:42,298",1.08,161,I am.
1,2,"00:12:43,345","00:12:47,055",3.71,162,A soul shifter is lurking within Songrim.
1,2,"00:12:51,520","00:12:56,066",4.55,163,"The son of Jang Gang of Songrim is asking me, an assassin, to be his master?"
1,2,"00:12:57,735","00:12:59,485",1.75,164,What original nonsense.
1,2,"00:13:01,155","00:13:04,615",3.46,165,You will open your pupil's gate of energy and help him master spells.
1,2,"00:13:05,201","00:13:08,041",2.84,166,"As your pupil, I will keep you safe and hidden."
1,2,"00:13:08,120","00:13:11,460",3.34,167,We could form a beautiful relationship where we benefit from each other.
1,2,"00:13:11,540","00:13:13,420",1.88,168,Not interested.
1,2,"00:13:11,540","00:13:15,211",3.67,169,"If you do not want to be my master, you could be my wife instead."
1,2,"00:13:15,294","00:13:16,594",1.30,170,Would you like that?
1,2,"00:13:15,294","00:13:16,594",1.30,171,Shut it.
1,2,"00:13:17,254","00:13:20,224",2.97,172,I heard you visited many masters and got kicked out every time.
1,2,"00:13:20,299","00:13:22,259",1.96,173,Was it because you were this stubborn?
1,2,"00:13:26,222","00:13:29,562",3.34,174,I could not threaten my former masters since they had no weakness.
1,2,"00:13:30,184","00:13:33,904",3.72,175,But you have a pretty big one.
1,2,"00:13:37,107","00:13:39,437",2.33,176,You cannot get out of here alive without my help.
1,2,"00:13:40,194","00:13:42,114",1.92,177,You will die if they find out who you are.
1,2,"00:13:43,030","00:13:44,160",1.13,178,Is that so?
1,2,"00:13:44,990","00:13:51,210",6.22,179,"In that case, I will just kill you."
1,2,"00:13:53,666","00:13:56,586",2.92,180,"How merciless. After all, I helped you."
1,2,"00:13:56,669","00:13:59,629",2.96,181,Sorry that I am so merciless for such a cute face.
1,2,"00:14:08,847","00:14:13,849",5.00,182,I brought you to our house with the Jade Plaque and to Songrim with the Spirit Plaque.
1,2,"00:14:14,645","00:14:16,725",2.08,183,"And now, look where we are."
1,2,"00:14:24,530","00:14:26,120",1.59,184,This is Songrim's secret room.
1,2,"00:14:27,074","00:14:30,544",3.47,185,"Once that door closes, we can only get out if someone opens from the outside."
1,2,"00:14:31,787","00:14:33,367",1.58,186,We are locked in here together.
1,2,"00:14:35,624","00:14:36,794",1.17,187,Do not move!
1,2,"00:14:37,293","00:14:39,883",2.59,188,"Step on the wrong spot, and the ground will cave in."
1,2,"00:14:43,173","00:14:47,303",4.13,189,"Kill me, and you will be killed by the Songrim mages who will enter."
1,2,"00:14:47,386","00:14:50,756",3.37,190,"But if you agree to be my master, we will get out of this unscathed."
1,2,"00:14:54,184","00:14:57,274",3.09,191,I do not have the strength to break his gate of energy right now.
1,2,"00:14:57,771","00:14:59,651",1.88,192,He will catch wind of it if I stay here.
1,2,"00:15:00,232","00:15:01,282",1.05,193,I need my sword.
1,2,"00:15:02,651","00:15:04,611",1.96,194,I have become weak due to shifting souls.
1,2,"00:15:04,695","00:15:07,525",2.83,195,I need my sword's energy to open your gate of energy.
1,2,"00:15:08,073","00:15:12,537",4.46,196,"Without that, there is nothing I can do in here."
1,2,"00:15:13,662","00:15:17,708",4.05,197,"To retrieve my sword, I need to go out there."
1,2,"00:15:17,791","00:15:18,921",1.13,198,So stop that.
1,2,"00:15:21,170","00:15:22,460",1.29,199,Did you not hear me?
1,2,"00:15:22,546","00:15:25,626",3.08,200,I cannot do that. I need to wait until it fully closes first.
1,2,"00:15:27,301","00:15:29,471",2.17,201,"You! You lied, did you not?"
1,2,"00:15:32,598","00:15:33,808",1.21,202,Do not move!
1,2,"00:15:33,891","00:15:36,061",2.17,203,"If you do, the ground will cave in!"
1,2,"00:15:33,891","00:15:36,061",2.17,204,Wait!
1,2,"00:15:39,146","00:15:40,766",1.62,205,Grab tightly! You are slipping!
1,2,"00:15:41,649","00:15:44,279",2.63,206,Where is your face touching?
1,2,"00:15:41,649","00:15:44,279",2.63,207,Shut it!
1,2,"00:15:44,360","00:15:46,070",1.71,208,Hey!
1,2,"00:15:44,360","00:15:46,070",1.71,209,Hey!
1,2,"00:15:46,153","00:15:47,113",0.96,210,You little…
1,2,"00:15:47,863","00:15:50,533",2.67,211,That hurts!
1,2,"00:15:47,863","00:15:50,533",2.67,212,It was not intentional.
1,2,"00:15:50,616","00:15:52,736",2.12,213,It hurts!
1,2,"00:15:50,616","00:15:52,736",2.12,214,Just wait.
1,2,"00:15:53,327","00:15:54,197",0.87,215,Let me go.
1,2,"00:16:00,000","00:16:02,250",2.25,216,"By the way, how will we find your sword?"
1,2,"00:16:03,128","00:16:05,128",2.00,217,I know who took it. I can find it.
1,2,"00:16:06,423","00:16:08,343",1.92,218,It is too dangerous to get out of Songrim.
1,2,"00:16:08,425","00:16:10,045",1.62,219,We need to stay inside.
1,2,"00:16:11,345","00:16:13,255",1.91,220,Does it have to be that specific sword?
1,2,"00:16:13,347","00:16:15,137",1.79,221,Get another sword with that energy and do it here.
1,2,"00:16:15,224","00:16:17,354",2.13,222,I cannot. It has to be mine.
1,2,"00:16:18,602","00:16:20,102",1.50,223,Let us go out and find it.
1,2,"00:16:21,063","00:16:24,193",3.13,224,I will lure him out and then kill him.
1,2,"00:16:25,526","00:16:27,276",1.75,225,You said you became weak.
1,2,"00:16:30,280","00:16:32,530",2.25,226,I thought you were pretending to be clumsy.
1,2,"00:16:33,909","00:16:35,079",1.17,227,How weak have you become?
1,2,"00:16:38,163","00:16:39,583",1.42,228,The mages are coming.
1,2,"00:16:39,665","00:16:40,705",1.04,229,Stay alert.
1,2,"00:16:43,585","00:16:46,545",2.96,230,Why would I? They are on my side.
1,2,"00:16:48,048","00:16:50,548",2.50,231,Taking sides?
1,2,"00:16:48,048","00:16:50,548",2.50,232,Are you seriously that childish?
1,2,"00:16:50,634","00:16:52,474",1.84,233,Why are you talking casually in this situation?
1,2,"00:16:52,553","00:16:53,763",1.21,234,"Fine, Young Master."
1,2,"00:16:53,846","00:16:55,096",1.25,235,I will look down.
1,2,"00:16:55,806","00:16:56,966",1.16,236,Look at you.
1,2,"00:17:04,231","00:17:05,271",1.04,237,Who is she?
1,2,"00:17:06,066","00:17:09,106",3.04,238,"I am Mu-deok, his maid."
1,2,"00:17:11,613","00:17:13,623",2.01,239,"You heard her, right? She is my maid."
1,2,"00:17:14,199","00:17:15,909",1.71,240,"You all seem busy. Go on, then."
1,2,"00:17:15,993","00:17:18,413",2.42,241,"Let us go, Mu-deok."
1,2,"00:17:15,993","00:17:18,413",2.42,242,You may not leave.
1,2,"00:17:21,081","00:17:24,081",3.00,243,The leader ordered everyone to gather at the Training Center.
1,2,"00:17:26,420","00:17:27,840",1.42,244,I am not a member of Songrim.
1,2,"00:17:27,921","00:17:33,049",5.13,245,He wants every living thing within these walls to gather there.
1,2,"00:17:41,643","00:17:43,153",1.51,246,Uk.
1,2,"00:17:41,643","00:17:43,153",1.51,247,Hey.
1,2,"00:17:45,064","00:17:47,484",2.42,248,What is going on?
1,2,"00:17:45,064","00:17:47,484",2.42,249,Why are we gathered here?
1,2,"00:17:48,025","00:17:50,645",2.62,250,They are going to catch Naksu's men who are in here.
1,2,"00:17:52,821","00:17:54,071",1.25,251,Naksu?
1,2,"00:18:04,833","00:18:08,996",4.16,252,One of you has helped Naksu's men who sneaked in here today.
1,2,"00:18:09,838","00:18:10,838",1.00,253,My lord.
1,2,"00:18:10,923","00:18:14,093",3.17,254,Everyone here knows each other.
1,2,"00:18:14,176","00:18:17,806",3.63,255,"On the outside, you all look like those of Songrim."
1,2,"00:18:20,057","00:18:21,977",1.92,256,That is why I asked someone for help.
1,2,"00:18:23,185","00:18:26,435",3.25,257,Lady Jin Cho-yeon of the Jin family has brought Gwigu.
1,2,"00:19:02,099","00:19:03,139",1.04,258,"Hello, my lady."
1,2,"00:19:17,114","00:19:19,244",2.13,259,Why is Jang Uk here?
1,2,"00:19:20,325","00:19:21,365",1.04,260,I am not sure.
1,2,"00:19:32,004","00:19:34,974",2.97,261,"That must be Gwigu, the Jin family's heirloom."
1,2,"00:19:35,048","00:19:36,088",1.04,262,Gwigu?
1,2,"00:19:36,675","00:19:37,965",1.29,263,As in a dog?
1,2,"00:19:36,675","00:19:37,965",1.29,264,Yes.
1,2,"00:19:38,051","00:19:40,761",2.71,265,It is a ghost Sapsali that detects sorcery.
1,2,"00:19:45,350","00:19:48,811",3.46,266,There is a soul shifter among us.
1,2,"00:19:50,272","00:19:54,362",4.09,267,And Gwigu will find that individual.
1,2,"00:19:55,027","00:19:57,647",2.62,268,They look like one of us on the outside.
1,2,"00:19:57,738","00:20:01,118",3.38,269,But Gwigu will find the one who has a different soul within them.
1,2,"00:20:07,289","00:20:09,039",1.75,270,Close all the doors.
1,2,"00:20:09,124","00:20:10,004",0.88,271,"Yes, my lord!"
1,2,"00:20:09,124","00:20:10,004",0.88,272,"Yes, my lord!"
1,2,"00:20:14,796","00:20:22,468",7.67,273,Whoever tries to leave this building will be considered a spy and killed.
1,2,"00:20:23,931","00:20:25,061",1.13,274,You may begin.
1,2,"00:21:26,326","00:21:29,826",3.50,275,"The alchemy of souls, a type of sorcery, has one weakness."
1,2,"00:21:29,913","00:21:31,873",1.96,276,There is a gap between the body and the soul.
1,2,"00:21:31,957","00:21:34,377",2.42,277,The evil energy seeps out from it.
1,2,"00:21:34,459","00:21:36,839",2.38,278,And Gwigu can detect that.
1,2,"00:22:05,574","00:22:08,584",3.01,279,"Uk, feign ignorance even if I get caught."
1,2,"00:22:10,996","00:22:13,116",2.12,280,Is this loyalty?
1,2,"00:22:10,996","00:22:13,116",2.12,281,It is my duty.
1,2,"00:22:19,296","00:22:24,384",5.09,282,I do not want to become a laughingstock once they find out I asked you for help.
1,2,"00:22:24,468","00:22:25,968",1.50,283,Stay right by my side.
1,2,"00:22:27,137","00:22:30,807",3.67,284,No one here will let that thing attack me.
1,2,"00:23:01,922","00:23:03,302",1.38,285,He is a soul shifter! Get him!
1,2,"00:24:31,928","00:24:35,018",3.09,286,I heard soul shifters get petrified when they run wild and lose their energy.
1,2,"00:24:35,098","00:24:36,308",1.21,287,It was true.
1,2,"00:25:04,878","00:25:07,338",2.46,288,We thank you for your great help.
1,2,"00:25:08,715","00:25:10,965",2.25,289,I am sure one day we will ask you for help too.
1,2,"00:25:12,135","00:25:16,715",4.58,290,I see that Daeho's four families have all gathered here.
1,2,"00:25:16,806","00:25:18,886",2.08,291,I heard you are called the Four Seasons.
1,2,"00:25:19,476","00:25:22,646",3.17,292,Seeing you all together makes me happy.
1,2,"00:25:23,396","00:25:28,400",5.00,293,"We used to gather often, but it is our first time after Uk and Cho-yeon called off their wedding."
1,2,"00:25:29,903","00:25:31,283",1.38,294,You little…
1,2,"00:25:31,863","00:25:34,323",2.46,295,I told them to prepare some tea in the reception room.
1,2,"00:25:34,407","00:25:35,617",1.21,296,Please come.
1,2,"00:25:42,290","00:25:44,080",1.79,297,You were here as well.
1,2,"00:25:44,793","00:25:46,883",2.09,298,I heard you were kicked out of Gisan.
1,2,"00:25:46,962","00:25:48,512",1.55,299,Right.
1,2,"00:25:49,422","00:25:52,222",2.80,300,You should stop keeping track of what I am doing.
1,2,"00:25:54,970","00:25:57,890",2.92,301,Everyone was talking about how you got kicked out yet again.
1,2,"00:25:57,973","00:25:59,523",1.55,302,I just happened to hear it.
1,2,"00:25:59,599","00:26:00,929",1.33,303,I see.
1,2,"00:26:01,977","00:26:06,308",4.33,304,"Our precious guest here seems uncomfortable around me, so let me excuse myself."
1,2,"00:26:09,776","00:26:11,026",1.25,305,What a scumbag.
1,2,"00:26:12,904","00:26:13,954",1.05,306,Let us go.
1,2,"00:26:16,157","00:26:17,237",1.08,307,Let us go.
1,2,"00:26:29,254","00:26:31,674",2.42,308,"Hey, excuse me."
1,2,"00:26:32,757","00:26:34,717",1.96,309,Did you see my maid?
1,2,"00:26:35,302","00:26:37,932",2.63,310,"She is short, thin, and has a round face."
1,2,"00:26:38,013","00:26:39,313",1.30,311,Darn it.
1,2,"00:26:40,181","00:26:41,811",1.63,312,Where did she go?
1,2,"00:26:43,560","00:26:46,650",3.09,313,The spy the Danju had sent here was a soul shifter.
1,2,"00:26:48,315","00:26:49,975",1.66,314,I must find the Danju.
1,2,"00:27:01,119","00:27:03,539",2.42,315,"You were not loyal, but you said you knew your duties."
1,2,"00:27:04,122","00:27:06,042",1.92,316,Can you say the same thing about this?
1,2,"00:27:07,125","00:27:09,535",2.41,317,That is exactly why I am leaving you behind.
1,2,"00:27:09,627","00:27:12,047",2.42,318,My original plan was to take you with me and kill you.
1,2,"00:27:12,130","00:27:13,090",0.96,319,I see.
1,2,"00:27:13,882","00:27:15,262",1.38,320,How evil.
1,2,"00:27:15,342","00:27:19,012",3.67,321,"I am not the round-faced Mu-deok, your loyal maid."
1,2,"00:27:19,929","00:27:22,889",2.96,322,You are Naksu. The merciless assassin.
1,2,"00:27:25,560","00:27:28,310",2.75,323,You had the chance to kill me when I was bathing.
1,2,"00:27:28,396","00:27:30,606",2.21,324,I even risked my life bringing you here with me.
1,2,"00:27:31,858","00:27:37,029",5.17,325,It is up to you whether to still kill me now or become my master after opening my gate of energy.
1,2,"00:27:42,452","00:27:46,622",4.17,326,"By the way, you have the habit of glaring at others."
1,2,"00:27:46,706","00:27:48,956",2.25,327,"Keep doing that, and you will get caught."
1,2,"00:27:50,085","00:27:52,245",2.16,328,Can you see the mark from where you are at?
1,2,"00:27:53,671","00:27:54,711",1.04,329,No.
1,2,"00:27:57,634","00:27:58,594",0.96,330,What about now?
1,2,"00:28:01,429","00:28:02,849",1.42,331,I can see it since I know already.
1,2,"00:28:04,849","00:28:05,979",1.13,332,And now?
1,2,"00:28:13,400","00:28:15,110",1.71,333,I can definitely see it.
1,2,"00:28:15,193","00:28:17,863",2.67,334,But I doubt you will be this up-close with someone often.
1,2,"00:28:18,530","00:28:20,410",1.88,335,Just be careful when you kiss someone.
1,2,"00:28:22,742","00:28:24,622",1.88,336,Come on. I am just helping you out.
1,2,"00:28:24,702","00:28:27,162",2.46,337,Anyone who came that close to me died in my hands.
1,2,"00:28:29,666","00:28:31,036",1.37,338,You could die tonight.
1,2,"00:28:32,419","00:28:33,629",1.21,339,It is the ghost Sapsali.
1,2,"00:28:41,136","00:28:44,469",3.33,340,"If that thing attacks you, will you turn to stone like that guy?"
1,2,"00:28:46,391","00:28:47,521",1.13,341,Run.
1,2,"00:28:49,644","00:28:50,734",1.09,342,I will try to save you.
1,2,"00:30:13,561","00:30:15,191",1.63,343,Gwigu's pottery.
1,2,"00:30:15,271","00:30:17,401",2.13,344,It was our family heirloom.
1,2,"00:30:18,691","00:30:21,611",2.92,345,I just wanted to take a look at it.
1,2,"00:30:21,694","00:30:24,784",3.09,346,But what kind of an heirloom is this fragile?
1,2,"00:30:24,864","00:30:26,204",1.34,347,Jang Uk!
1,2,"00:30:29,911","00:30:31,661",1.75,348,We need to talk. Come here.
1,2,"00:30:32,330","00:30:33,410",1.08,349,Uk.
1,2,"00:30:35,458","00:30:36,578",1.12,350,Uk.
1,2,"00:30:38,419","00:30:41,629",3.21,351,"Hey, Uk. Jang Uk!"
1,2,"00:30:46,344","00:30:47,434",1.09,352,Uk!
1,2,"00:30:48,763","00:30:49,853",1.09,353,Uk!
1,2,"00:30:50,473","00:30:51,813",1.34,354,Jang Uk!
1,2,"00:30:52,392","00:30:53,772",1.38,355,Darn it!
1,2,"00:30:55,103","00:30:56,063",0.96,356,Uk!
1,2,"00:30:57,272","00:31:00,608",3.34,357,Gather all the pieces since I will have to put them back together.
1,2,"00:31:00,692","00:31:01,992",1.30,358,"Yes, my lady."
1,2,"00:31:00,692","00:31:01,992",1.30,359,"Yes, my lady."
1,2,"00:31:17,208","00:31:18,498",1.29,360,Jeez.
1,2,"00:31:19,127","00:31:20,957",1.83,361,That is the work of your young master.
1,2,"00:31:22,672","00:31:25,342",2.67,362,So that is how he saved me.
1,2,"00:31:25,425","00:31:26,505",1.08,363,"Gosh, that kid."
1,2,"00:31:26,593","00:31:29,143",2.55,364,"Last year, he broke off the engagement with the Jin family."
1,2,"00:31:29,220","00:31:31,640",2.42,365,"This time, he broke their heirloom."
1,2,"00:31:31,723","00:31:33,983",2.26,366,Engagement?
1,2,"00:31:31,723","00:31:33,983",2.26,367,Yes.
1,2,"00:31:35,184","00:31:37,064",1.88,368,He called off the wedding with her.
1,2,"00:31:37,729","00:31:41,269",3.54,369,"He got kicked out 12 times, broke off a wedding, and now, an heirloom."
1,2,"00:31:41,357","00:31:42,817",1.46,370,What a disaster.
1,2,"00:31:45,570","00:31:47,280",1.71,371,What will you do about him?
1,2,"00:31:48,197","00:31:49,367",1.17,372,Where is he?
1,2,"00:31:50,366","00:31:51,276",0.91,373,He got dragged away.
1,2,"00:31:51,951","00:31:55,291",3.34,374,I am afraid he will face severe punishment this time.
1,2,"00:32:02,712","00:32:05,212",2.50,375,I sent you to Gisan.
1,2,"00:32:06,299","00:32:08,509",2.21,376,Then you were kicked out in less than six months.
1,2,"00:32:09,344","00:32:11,104",1.76,377,Why did you come here tonight?
1,2,"00:32:11,179","00:32:14,219",3.04,378,"I heard you were troubled by the news, so I came to apologize."
1,2,"00:32:14,807","00:32:16,177",1.37,379,Is this how you apologize?
1,2,"00:32:18,811","00:32:21,691",2.88,380,Why did you break the pottery?
1,2,"00:32:21,773","00:32:26,737",4.96,381,"I was fascinated by it and wanted to take a look, but it slipped out of my hands."
1,2,"00:32:26,819","00:32:29,359",2.54,382,"Had I learned spells, that would not have happened."
1,2,"00:32:29,447","00:32:30,907",1.46,383,I guess I lack the teachings.
1,2,"00:32:30,990","00:32:32,580",1.59,384,Jang Uk!
1,2,"00:32:34,243","00:32:38,332",4.09,385,He also tampered with the door of the secret room and damaged it.
1,2,"00:32:38,831","00:32:41,961",3.13,386,He definitely did that on purpose.
1,2,"00:32:38,831","00:32:41,961",3.13,387,He is just jealous.
1,2,"00:32:42,752","00:32:45,842",3.09,388,I will not let it slide this time around.
1,2,"00:32:46,798","00:32:53,721",6.92,389,"Until I say so, I forbid Jang Uk from moving or talking."
1,2,"00:32:55,056","00:32:56,346",1.29,390,Repent.
1,2,"00:33:15,576","00:33:16,576",1.00,391,Do not worry.
1,2,"00:33:18,037","00:33:19,907",1.87,392,He will not punish him for too long.
1,2,"00:33:21,457","00:33:25,173",3.72,393,He almost died of a cold after he was punished all night long one day.
1,2,"00:33:26,087","00:33:29,377",3.29,394,Uk's gate of energy is opened just enough to keep him alive.
1,2,"00:33:29,465","00:33:32,045",2.58,395,So extreme cold or heat can be life-threatening.
1,2,"00:33:32,844","00:33:34,054",1.21,396,He cannot recover when he falls ill.
1,2,"00:33:34,637","00:33:38,517",3.88,397,Then open his gate of energy for him.
1,2,"00:33:34,637","00:33:38,517",3.88,398,He desperately wants it.
1,2,"00:33:39,142","00:33:40,852",1.71,399,You are his friends.
1,2,"00:33:41,894","00:33:43,774",1.88,400,We are still too weak to do that.
1,2,"00:33:45,106","00:33:46,566",1.46,401,But no one in Songrim…
1,2,"00:33:46,649","00:33:50,279",3.63,402,No. No one in Daeho is allowed to do that.
1,2,"00:33:55,491","00:33:58,621",3.13,403,Then he is already being punished for his entire lifetime.
1,2,"00:34:33,321","00:34:35,361",2.04,404,You are allowed to have a hot cup of tea.
1,2,"00:34:38,910","00:34:40,040",1.13,405,Young Master.
1,2,"00:34:40,661","00:34:43,581",2.92,406,I will go first and leave you behind.
1,2,"00:34:45,166","00:34:46,536",1.37,407,You are leaving without me?
1,2,"00:34:54,008","00:34:56,388",2.38,408,You are loyal and know your duties.
1,2,"00:34:57,261","00:35:02,893",5.63,409,"That is why you took me in, brought me here, and protected me."
1,2,"00:35:03,976","00:35:07,266",3.29,410,You must know very well that you cannot tell that to anyone.
1,2,"00:35:20,159","00:35:22,659",2.50,411,I will be safe thanks to you.
1,2,"00:35:33,673","00:35:36,683",3.01,412,The people I have met so far only wanted me dead.
1,2,"00:35:37,969","00:35:42,852",4.88,413,You are the first person who tried to save me.
1,2,"00:35:49,188","00:35:53,991",4.80,414,"Even if we meet again and come this close to each other, I will spare you."
1,2,"00:36:51,083","00:36:58,215",7.13,415,I will send a gift of apology to Gisan and pay the Jin family a hefty sum for what he did.
1,2,"00:36:58,799","00:37:02,219",3.42,416,Uk made too many mistakes this time.
1,2,"00:37:03,763","00:37:05,473",1.71,417,I had no choice but to punish him.
1,2,"00:37:05,556","00:37:07,386",1.83,418,I am glad you punished him.
1,2,"00:37:08,476","00:37:11,766",3.29,419,"Since you have done enough, I will take him home now."
1,2,"00:37:12,521","00:37:13,691",1.17,420,Sure.
1,2,"00:37:15,399","00:37:16,529",1.13,421,Thank you.
1,2,"00:37:22,448","00:37:25,528",3.08,422,Are you all right?
1,2,"00:37:22,448","00:37:25,528",3.08,423,"No, I am not."
1,2,"00:37:27,536","00:37:29,746",2.21,424,Did Mudeoki stop by our place?
1,2,"00:37:30,331","00:37:32,331",2.00,425,Why would she?
1,2,"00:37:33,209","00:37:36,879",3.67,426,"Speaking of which, where did she go while you were being punished?"
1,2,"00:37:37,505","00:37:38,585",1.08,427,Forget it.
1,2,"00:37:41,884","00:37:44,764",2.88,428,"By the way, why did you tamper with the secret room?"
1,2,"00:37:45,846","00:37:47,426",1.58,429,The stone door will not close.
1,2,"00:37:48,099","00:37:49,429",1.33,430,I do not know.
1,2,"00:37:52,311","00:37:54,811",2.50,431,Why did you break the pottery?
1,2,"00:37:52,311","00:37:54,811",2.50,432,I do not…
1,2,"00:37:56,816","00:37:58,396",1.58,433,I said I do not know.
1,2,"00:37:59,026","00:38:00,356",1.33,434,Stop asking me.
1,2,"00:38:10,454","00:38:12,374",1.92,435,Here are the firecrackers you wanted.
1,2,"00:38:12,456","00:38:14,496",2.04,436,They will be able to see them from miles away.
1,2,"00:38:17,545","00:38:18,665",1.12,437,All right.
1,2,"00:38:19,672","00:38:22,632",2.96,438,Why does Young Master Jang want them?
1,2,"00:38:22,717","00:38:25,087",2.37,439,Rumor has it that he was punished severely.
1,2,"00:38:25,177","00:38:26,677",1.50,440,So what is he scheming this time?
1,2,"00:38:28,681","00:38:29,681",1.00,441,It is a secret.
1,2,"00:38:30,558","00:38:32,348",1.79,442,"Do not tell anyone about this, okay?"
1,2,"00:38:34,145","00:38:35,395",1.25,443,Ju-wol.
1,2,"00:38:37,273","00:38:39,323",2.05,444,He should lie low for now.
1,2,"00:38:46,073","00:38:47,453",1.38,445,This is Songrim's Spirit Plaque.
1,2,"00:38:48,034","00:38:49,914",1.88,446,Are you free to enter there?
1,2,"00:38:49,994","00:38:52,164",2.17,447,Your young master must really trust you.
1,2,"00:38:52,913","00:38:55,003",2.09,448,This is such a precious item.
1,2,"00:38:56,083","00:38:57,633",1.55,449,He wants me to sell it.
1,2,"00:38:58,544","00:39:01,214",2.67,450,You cannot sell something like this that easily.
1,2,"00:39:01,297","00:39:02,297",1.00,451,Is that so?
1,2,"00:39:02,840","00:39:05,130",2.29,452,He said I would be able to sell it somewhere.
1,2,"00:39:05,718","00:39:10,224",4.51,453,"But then again, there is a merchant who purchases black market goods."
1,2,"00:39:11,807","00:39:14,227",2.42,454,But it will not be easy to hook you up.
1,2,"00:39:20,733","00:39:22,863",2.13,455,You will be getting a hefty sum.
1,2,"00:39:22,943","00:39:24,863",1.92,456,Can I have another chicken?
1,2,"00:39:24,945","00:39:27,525",2.58,457,Sure. I will put it on your young master's tab.
1,2,"00:39:27,615","00:39:29,525",1.91,458,Eat up. Eat lots.
1,2,"00:39:36,791","00:39:41,091",4.30,459,"Naksu's body may be here, but her soul lives on in another body."
1,2,"00:39:41,962","00:39:45,882",3.92,460,You will also be given new bodies through the alchemy of souls.
1,2,"00:39:45,966","00:39:50,346",4.38,461,So do not be afraid to sacrifice yourselves for me.
1,2,"00:39:50,429","00:39:51,599",1.17,462,"Yes, sir."
1,2,"00:39:50,429","00:39:51,599",1.17,463,"Yes, sir."
1,2,"00:40:11,742","00:40:12,662",0.92,464,Fire!
1,2,"00:40:31,345","00:40:32,845",1.50,465,I need my sword.
1,2,"00:40:32,930","00:40:34,970",2.04,466,I have become weak due to shifting souls.
1,2,"00:40:35,683","00:40:38,603",2.92,467,I need my sword's energy to open your gate of energy.
1,2,"00:40:38,686","00:40:43,397",4.71,468,"Even if we meet again and come this close to each other, I will spare you."
1,2,"00:40:48,195","00:40:50,655",2.46,469,I have no appetite.
1,2,"00:40:48,195","00:40:50,655",2.46,470,Young Master Jang.
1,2,"00:40:52,867","00:40:54,657",1.79,471,"Young Master Jang, they caught them."
1,2,"00:40:55,244","00:40:57,914",2.67,472,Mudeoki?
1,2,"00:40:55,244","00:40:57,914",2.67,473,Why would anyone catch her?
1,2,"00:40:58,914","00:41:01,044",2.13,474,Never mind.
1,2,"00:41:01,125","00:41:05,338",4.21,475,"Jin Mu, the Assistant Gwanju of Cheonbugwan, caught Naksu's men who raided Songrim."
1,2,"00:41:05,963","00:41:06,963",1.00,476,Really?
1,2,"00:41:09,550","00:41:13,430",3.88,477,Jin Mu brought the bodies of Naksu's men into the palace.
1,2,"00:41:13,512","00:41:15,642",2.13,478,We were the ones who caught Naksu.
1,2,"00:41:15,723","00:41:18,523",2.80,479,So I am worried we will become a laughingstock.
1,2,"00:41:18,601","00:41:23,806",5.20,480,Is it true that he spared none of the men?
1,2,"00:41:23,898","00:41:25,398",1.50,481,He killed them all.
1,2,"00:41:26,901","00:41:29,741",2.84,482,We have no way to track the source of the alchemy of souls.
1,2,"00:41:31,864","00:41:34,204",2.34,483,Jin Ho-gyeong of Jinyowon is here too.
1,2,"00:41:39,330","00:41:44,340",5.01,484,"I heard Jin Mu, the Assistant Gwanju of Cheonbugwan, caught the assassins that Songrim could not."
1,2,"00:41:45,169","00:41:48,169",3.00,485,How did they break Songrim's barrier twice?
1,2,"00:41:53,010","00:41:55,260",2.25,486,There was a soul shifter spy inside Songrim.
1,2,"00:41:55,346","00:41:58,636",3.29,487,"Thankfully, the Jin family's Gwigu caught him."
1,2,"00:41:59,600","00:42:00,890",1.29,488,Gwigu?
1,2,"00:42:00,976","00:42:02,846",1.87,489,I would like to see it too.
1,2,"00:42:02,937","00:42:05,227",2.29,490,I am afraid I cannot show you right now.
1,2,"00:42:05,314","00:42:08,154",2.84,491,They made the mistake of accidentally breaking it.
1,2,"00:42:09,235","00:42:11,485",2.25,492,How could you make such a foolish mistake?
1,2,"00:42:12,947","00:42:14,197",1.25,493,"My apologies, Your Majesty."
1,2,"00:42:15,241","00:42:21,745",6.50,494,"Since Jin Mu made this contribution, I summoned you all to tell you that I am considering promoting him to Gwanju."
1,2,"00:42:22,957","00:42:24,207",1.25,495,That is not right.
1,2,"00:42:24,291","00:42:27,001",2.71,496,Jang Gang is still the current Gwanju.
1,2,"00:42:27,086","00:42:32,052",4.97,497,"For he was given the robe and the sword by the late king, Jang Gang is the Gwanju of Cheonbugwan."
1,2,"00:42:32,633","00:42:35,303",2.67,498,"Furthermore, he has a son, Jang Uk."
1,2,"00:42:35,386","00:42:40,144",4.76,499,Jang Gang… has been away for decades using his training as an excuse.
1,2,"00:42:40,224","00:42:43,274",3.05,500,"His son, Jang Uk, physically cannot learn spells."
1,2,"00:42:43,352","00:42:47,612",4.26,501,Assistant Gwanju Jin Mu has been the one to fill in for him.
1,2,"00:42:49,441","00:42:55,199",5.76,502,"Your Majesty, the dark soul-related spell is forbidden sorcery among mages."
1,2,"00:42:55,281","00:42:59,790",4.51,503,And Songrim has always been the one to keep this under control.
1,2,"00:43:00,369","00:43:05,416",5.05,504,Songrim could have gotten to the bottom of this soul shifter incident and gotten rid of it all.
1,2,"00:43:07,042","00:43:10,922",3.88,505,But Jin Mu killed every single one of them.
1,2,"00:43:12,047","00:43:14,507",2.46,506,He actually ruined everything.
1,2,"00:43:14,592","00:43:19,892",5.30,507,Are you unhappy that Cheonbugwan took the credit?
1,2,"00:43:19,972","00:43:22,102",2.13,508,Songrim was the one who caught Naksu!
1,2,"00:43:22,182","00:43:24,062",1.88,509,And you took credit for it!
1,2,"00:43:26,395","00:43:28,305",1.91,510,We are not here to discuss that.
1,2,"00:43:30,816","00:43:37,570",6.75,511,"As for the Gwanju position, we will hold a mage meeting and make a decision once Jang Gang returns."
1,2,"00:43:38,574","00:43:41,704",3.13,512,Please grant him a different reward.
1,2,"00:43:45,205","00:43:46,455",1.25,513,Jin Mu.
1,2,"00:43:48,417","00:43:50,207",1.79,514,Tell me what you desire.
1,2,"00:43:53,088","00:43:55,008",1.92,515,The people are troubled by this sorcery.
1,2,"00:43:55,090","00:43:57,510",2.42,516,Allow me to burn Naksu's body in front of Cheonbugwan.
1,2,"00:43:57,593","00:43:58,763",1.17,517,As for Naksu's sword…
1,2,"00:43:59,845","00:44:03,175",3.33,518,Allow us to keep it since Songrim has lost it once already.
1,2,"00:44:06,602","00:44:08,312",1.71,519,You may do that.
1,2,"00:44:17,529","00:44:24,544",7.01,520,The best swords of the mages have always been stored in the Sword Room of Jeongjingak.
1,2,"00:44:25,663","00:44:28,083",2.42,521,But things have changed after that incident.
1,2,"00:44:29,541","00:44:31,711",2.17,522,Jin Mu of Cheonbugwan took Naksu's sword?
1,2,"00:44:31,794","00:44:35,384",3.59,523,Yes. He will burn Naksu's body there too.
1,2,"00:44:35,464","00:44:38,054",2.59,524,She will be there to witness her body getting burned.
1,2,"00:44:38,133","00:44:39,183",1.05,525,Who?
1,2,"00:44:39,259","00:44:40,179",0.92,526,Naksu?
1,2,"00:44:40,928","00:44:43,138",2.21,527,Do you still think Naksu has switched souls?
1,2,"00:44:44,306","00:44:46,806",2.50,528,Are you serious about accepting Naksu as your master?
1,2,"00:44:47,976","00:44:49,096",1.12,529,Forget it.
1,2,"00:44:50,020","00:44:51,360",1.34,530,Pour me some more tea.
1,2,"00:44:54,358","00:44:58,901",4.54,531,"You can do that yourself, lazybones."
1,2,"00:45:01,740","00:45:04,280",2.54,532,"Where is your maid, Mudeoki?"
1,2,"00:45:05,661","00:45:09,461",3.80,533,I will find her.
1,2,"00:45:05,661","00:45:09,461",3.80,534,"But first, I need that sword."
1,2,"00:45:16,547","00:45:22,223",5.68,535,"Seeing how he got rid of everything that was mine, he must think I failed to switch souls and died."
1,2,"00:45:23,762","00:45:26,642",2.88,536,I cannot look for the Danju since I do not know who he is.
1,2,"00:45:35,274","00:45:39,530",4.26,537,"Find the merchant who is selling a drawn Spirit Plaque, and you will find me."
1,2,"00:45:40,112","00:45:41,412",1.30,538,I will be waiting.
1,2,"00:46:04,136","00:46:05,596",1.46,539,That is Danhyanggok.
1,2,"00:46:08,724","00:46:12,234",3.51,540,CHEONBUGWAN
1,2,"00:46:12,311","00:46:14,021",1.71,541,I am here for Naksu's sword.
1,2,"00:46:14,730","00:46:16,020",1.29,542,Why would you?
1,2,"00:46:16,106","00:46:19,146",3.04,543,I heard His Majesty allowed Cheonbugwan to keep it.
1,2,"00:46:19,234","00:46:22,744",3.51,544,"Since Jang Gang is the Gwanju, it is right for his family to keep it."
1,2,"00:46:22,821","00:46:26,486",3.66,545,"Since your father is not here, it is only right that the Assistant Gwanju keeps it."
1,2,"00:46:29,953","00:46:33,543",3.59,546,"Since my father is not here, I, his son, should keep it."
1,2,"00:46:38,253","00:46:40,673",2.42,547,I heard you are searching everywhere for your master.
1,2,"00:46:41,423","00:46:43,133",1.71,548,I would like to take you in myself.
1,2,"00:46:43,800","00:46:46,510",2.71,549,But I cannot defy your father's commands since he was my master once.
1,2,"00:46:48,180","00:46:51,270",3.09,550,Why did he close his own son's gate of energy?
1,2,"00:46:52,309","00:46:54,189",1.88,551,I just cannot fathom it.
1,2,"00:46:58,857","00:47:01,277",2.42,552,The mage's energy flows through this sword.
1,2,"00:47:01,360","00:47:05,450",4.09,553,Someone as ordinary as you will not be able to unsheathe it.
1,2,"00:47:29,179","00:47:30,969",1.79,554,Are you afraid I will do it?
1,2,"00:47:33,892","00:47:39,442",5.55,555,"If I unsheathe it, I will be qualified as the next Gwanju. meaning you will be disqualified from getting that position."
1,2,"00:47:44,861","00:47:45,901",1.04,556,Do not worry.
1,2,"00:47:46,697","00:47:48,067",1.37,557,I cannot unsheathe it for now.
1,2,"00:48:00,002","00:48:01,212",1.21,558,"""For now""?"
1,2,"00:48:05,090","00:48:07,760",2.67,559,I saw firecrackers coming from Danhyanggok.
1,2,"00:48:07,843","00:48:09,683",1.84,560,Are you sure it was Danhyanggok?
1,2,"00:48:09,761","00:48:10,601",0.84,561,"Yes, my lord."
1,2,"00:48:10,679","00:48:13,219",2.54,562,"They came from the valley, Naksu's former home."
1,2,"00:48:33,102","00:48:35,063",1.96,563,I am looking for the one with the Spirit Plaque.
1,2,"00:48:44,338","00:48:46,128",1.79,564,"Ma'am, they are here."
1,2,"00:48:50,927","00:48:52,677",1.75,565,I guess someone wants to buy it.
1,2,"00:48:58,268","00:49:00,098",1.83,566,"The very last room, please."
1,2,"00:49:06,026","00:49:07,816",1.79,567,How could you lose it?
1,2,"00:49:07,903","00:49:10,283",2.38,568,I did not lose it. Someone stole it.
1,2,"00:49:10,364","00:49:11,874",1.51,569,I am certain it was Ae-hyang.
1,2,"00:49:14,326","00:49:16,326",2.00,570,Are you the one who brought this?
1,2,"00:49:18,830","00:49:21,080",2.25,571,I am here to buy the Spirit Plaque.
1,2,"00:49:21,917","00:49:23,457",1.54,572,You have come to the right person.
1,2,"00:49:30,717","00:49:32,507",1.79,573,She is no longer useful.
1,2,"00:49:32,594","00:49:34,434",1.84,574,Kill her to avoid further problems.
1,2,"00:49:46,729","00:49:47,778",1.05,575,"You know me, right?"
1,2,"00:49:47,859","00:49:50,580",2.72,576,I told you to let me know if someone brought that drawing.
1,2,"00:49:50,737","00:49:51,815",1.08,577,And I did.
1,2,"00:49:52,322","00:49:54,532",2.21,578,She is meeting them upstairs.
1,2,"00:49:55,409","00:49:57,659",2.25,579,So it was Ae-hyang.
1,2,"00:50:02,916","00:50:04,456",1.54,580,We are mages from Cheonbugwan.
1,2,"00:50:05,043","00:50:08,263",3.22,581,We just caught a thief.
1,2,"00:50:05,043","00:50:08,263",3.22,582,You can mind your own business.
1,2,"00:50:14,469","00:50:15,639",1.17,583,He killed her.
1,2,"00:50:16,680","00:50:18,220",1.54,584,He thought it was me.
1,2,"00:50:47,419","00:50:49,589",2.17,585,The Danju has cut me off.
1,2,"00:51:16,948","00:51:19,238",2.29,586,Is that truly you?
1,2,"00:51:23,955","00:51:26,035",2.08,587,Begin.
1,2,"00:51:23,955","00:51:26,035",2.08,588,"Yes, my lord."
1,2,"00:51:52,359","00:51:55,029",2.67,589,Cheonbugwan caught Naksu when Songrim failed?
1,2,"00:51:55,111","00:51:57,491",2.38,590,Songrim was pretty much humiliated.
1,2,"00:51:57,572","00:52:00,992",3.42,591,The Assistant Gwanju is over there.
1,2,"00:52:01,076","00:52:02,365",1.29,592,You are right.
1,2,"00:52:18,218","00:52:23,973",5.76,593,"So the Danju was Jin Mu, the Assistant Gwanju of the royal Cheonbugwan."
1,2,"00:52:36,278","00:52:38,108",1.83,594,I am burning.
1,2,"00:52:39,614","00:52:43,954",4.34,595,Just like how my house and parents burned on that day.
1,2,"00:52:50,250","00:52:52,040",1.79,596,I will give you power.
1,2,"00:52:52,127","00:52:53,837",1.71,597,Will you come with me?
1,2,"00:53:32,000","00:53:33,210",1.21,598,Young Master Jang.
1,2,"00:53:34,169","00:53:39,717",5.55,599,"As you can see, there is nothing I can do but watch my body burn."
1,2,"00:53:41,551","00:53:43,511",1.96,600,There is nothing I can do for you either.
1,2,"00:53:50,810","00:53:52,150",1.34,601,I found your sword.
1,2,"00:53:59,653","00:54:01,993",2.34,602,You said you could retrieve your power with this.
1,2,"00:54:08,995","00:54:12,035",3.04,603,Why are you standing still?
1,2,"00:54:08,995","00:54:12,035",3.04,604,Pick it up and unsheathe it.
1,2,"00:54:29,975","00:54:32,515",2.54,605,An excellent blade recognizes its owner.
1,2,"00:54:42,654","00:54:45,374",2.72,606,"Now, I just need to receive its energy."
1,2,"00:55:21,943","00:55:26,740",4.80,607,You are too weak to handle and unsheathe your own sword.
1,2,"00:55:29,117","00:55:30,947",1.83,608,You are just as powerless as me.
1,2,"00:55:31,953","00:55:33,253",1.30,609,We are useless.
1,2,"00:55:38,543","00:55:41,093",2.55,610,That is enough. Forget it.
1,2,"00:55:41,796","00:55:42,916",1.12,611,Just go.
1,2,"00:55:48,636","00:55:52,466",3.83,612,"I doubt you will be a threat to Songrim, and Naksu is already gone."
1,2,"00:55:53,808","00:55:55,938",2.13,613,Just live as Mu-deok.
1,2,"00:56:00,815","00:56:08,074",7.26,614,I would rather die… than live like this.
1,2,"00:56:10,617","00:56:12,287",1.67,615,Then be my guest.
1,2,"00:57:04,462","00:57:06,422",1.96,616,This is the grave of the Soul Shifters.
1,2,"00:57:07,507","00:57:12,643",5.14,617,The one who taught me this spell also disposed of their bodies here.
1,2,"00:57:23,565","00:57:27,939",4.37,618,So this will be my grave as well.
1,2,"00:57:55,680","00:57:59,390",3.71,619,"Young Master Jang, how long should we keep this place closed?"
1,2,"00:58:00,768","00:58:02,098",1.33,620,I am done now.
1,2,"00:58:02,770","00:58:04,480",1.71,621,What is wrong with Mudeoki?
1,2,"00:58:04,564","00:58:06,234",1.67,622,She seemed out of it.
1,2,"00:58:10,445","00:58:11,695",1.25,623,I am just worried.
1,2,"00:58:12,614","00:58:14,914",2.30,624,She was heading toward Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.
1,2,"00:58:17,660","00:58:18,830",1.17,625,Lake Gyeongcheondaeho?
1,2,"00:58:22,123","00:58:26,785",4.66,626,I would rather die… than live like this.
1,2,"00:58:26,878","00:58:28,338",1.46,627,Then be my guest.
1,2,"00:59:41,995","00:59:43,115",1.12,628,Mu-deok!
1,2,"00:59:44,080","00:59:45,160",1.08,629,Mu-deok!
1,2,"00:59:49,836","00:59:50,916",1.08,630,Darn it…
1,2,"01:00:49,187","01:00:52,647",3.46,631,"SEJUKWON, SONGRIM"
1,2,"01:01:03,117","01:01:04,577",1.46,632,You are in Sejukwon.
1,2,"01:01:05,536","01:01:07,326",1.79,633,Master Heo Yeom's infirmary in Songrim.
1,2,"01:01:08,456","01:01:11,416",2.96,634,"Thanks to you, I could come here even though I was once forbidden."
1,2,"01:01:14,128","01:01:17,508",3.38,635,Your eyes are probably sore.
1,2,"01:01:14,128","01:01:17,508",3.38,636,I put in some eye drops.
1,2,"01:01:18,383","01:01:21,343",2.96,637,He said the blue marks in your eyes were like bruises.
1,2,"01:01:21,427","01:01:23,967",2.54,638,These eye drops will lighten their color.
1,2,"01:01:24,597","01:01:25,677",1.08,639,Put them in regularly.
1,2,"01:01:33,564","01:01:35,194",1.63,640,I unsheathed this before.
1,2,"01:01:36,943","01:01:38,073",1.13,641,I definitely did.
1,2,"01:01:38,152","01:01:39,652",1.50,642,I know. I saw it.
1,2,"01:01:40,405","01:01:42,195",1.79,643,But you are still too weak.
1,2,"01:01:42,281","01:01:44,531",2.25,644,You could only do it thanks to that lake's energy.
1,2,"01:01:45,910","01:01:47,950",2.04,645,I had regained my power inside that lake.
1,2,"01:01:49,580","01:01:50,870",1.29,646,I should go back there.
1,2,"01:01:50,957","01:01:54,417",3.46,647,Then what?
1,2,"01:01:50,957","01:01:54,417",3.46,648,Will you live underwater like a fish?
1,2,"01:01:59,882","01:02:03,012",3.13,649,I felt a surge of energy underwater.
1,2,"01:02:03,094","01:02:04,724",1.63,650,That is how I regained my power.
1,2,"01:02:05,304","01:02:06,474",1.17,651,That is it.
1,2,"01:02:07,557","01:02:13,435",5.88,652,Someone who has energy as powerful as that lake should push out the energy within me.
1,2,"01:02:13,521","01:02:16,361",2.84,653,And who exactly?
1,2,"01:02:13,521","01:02:16,361",2.84,654,Will you be searching for a master too?
1,2,"01:02:17,024","01:02:20,194",3.17,655,"Do you think there is anyone that powerful, to begin with?"
1,2,"01:02:20,278","01:02:23,238",2.96,656,"Even if there was, would they want to help you?"
1,2,"01:02:24,407","01:02:26,422",2.01,657,"You are Naksu, an assassin who shifted her soul."
1,2,"01:02:29,579","01:02:30,499",0.92,658,What?
1,2,"01:02:30,580","01:02:33,170",2.59,659,Uk came to Sejukwon?
1,2,"01:02:33,750","01:02:35,920",2.17,660,He came to treat his maid who was injured.
1,2,"01:02:36,002","01:02:37,672",1.67,661,He barged in.
1,2,"01:02:37,754","01:02:38,884",1.13,662,His maid?
1,2,"01:02:40,298","01:02:41,718",1.42,663,"Mu-deok, was it?"
1,2,"01:02:41,799","01:02:46,721",4.92,664,How bad were her injuries that he would come all the way here himself?
1,2,"01:03:02,862","01:03:04,992",2.13,665,I have only heard of Sejukwon.
1,2,"01:03:05,823","01:03:07,453",1.63,666,It sure is an incredible infirmary.
1,2,"01:03:08,618","01:03:10,448",1.83,667,There are all sorts of medicinal herbs.
1,2,"01:03:11,078","01:03:12,498",1.42,668,And poisonous ones too.
1,2,"01:03:18,252","01:03:22,012",3.76,669,I am sure these eye drops will make your eye color faint.
1,2,"01:03:22,089","01:03:23,629",1.54,670,Lie low and live as Mu-deok.
1,2,"01:03:24,509","01:03:26,009",1.50,671,This is all I can do for you.
1,2,"01:03:26,093","01:03:27,393",1.30,672,You are wrong.
1,2,"01:03:28,554","01:03:31,104",2.55,673,I want you to be my Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.
1,2,"01:03:34,519","01:03:37,189",2.67,674,You said you risked your life many times for me.
1,2,"01:03:38,439","01:03:40,149",1.71,675,Do it one more time.
1,2,"01:03:46,614","01:03:47,914",1.30,676,It will be pretty painful.
1,2,"01:03:55,289","01:03:56,669",1.38,677,What did you put in here?
1,2,"01:03:59,001","01:04:01,001",2.00,678,One of the poisonous herbs.
1,2,"01:04:07,802","01:04:09,602",1.80,679,I am betting everything on you.
1,2,"01:04:11,681","01:04:14,641",2.96,680,So I hope you will survive.
1,2,"01:04:31,117","01:04:37,706",6.59,681,"If you do, I will be your master."
1,2,"01:04:47,550","01:04:49,180",1.63,682,Uk!
1,2,"01:04:50,136","01:04:52,176",2.04,683,What is wrong? Uk!
1,2,"01:04:52,263","01:04:53,353",1.09,684,Uk!
1,2,"01:04:53,431","01:04:54,721",1.29,685,What is wrong with him?
1,2,"01:04:55,349","01:04:56,479",1.13,686,He ingested poison.
1,2,"01:04:58,185","01:04:59,685",1.50,687,Poison?
1,2,"01:04:58,185","01:04:59,685",1.50,688,What poison?
1,2,"01:04:59,770","01:05:03,320",3.55,689,His heart will stop in six hours.
1,2,"01:05:03,399","01:05:04,569",1.17,690,What poison was it?
1,2,"01:05:04,650","01:05:08,913",4.26,691,It will be too late by the time you find out and concoct an antidote.
1,2,"01:05:08,988","01:05:11,528",2.54,692,There is only one way to save him.
1,2,"01:05:11,616","01:05:16,624",5.01,693,Open his gate of energy and remove the poison with both of your energy.
1,2,"01:05:16,704","01:05:17,914",1.21,694,What?
1,2,"01:05:16,704","01:05:17,914",1.21,695,What?
1,2,"01:05:19,415","01:05:21,075",1.66,696,Open his gate of energy.
1,2,"01:05:21,709","01:05:23,289",1.58,697,"Or else, he will die."
1,2,"01:05:26,964","01:05:28,764",1.80,698,Yul…
1,2,"01:05:29,508","01:05:31,258",1.75,699,Uk ingested poison.
1,2,"01:05:32,094","01:05:33,354",1.26,700,They say he's going to die.
1,2,"01:05:33,429","01:05:36,269",2.84,701,What?
1,2,"01:05:33,429","01:05:36,269",2.84,702,Mu-deok was the one who gave it to him.
1,2,"01:05:36,349","01:05:41,599",5.25,703,"But she will not say what kind of poison it was, so my uncle is torturing her right now."
1,2,"01:05:47,276","01:05:48,856",1.58,704,What was the poison?
1,2,"01:05:53,199","01:05:54,949",1.75,705,Keep going.
1,2,"01:05:55,034","01:05:57,414",2.38,706,"She could die, my lord."
1,2,"01:05:55,034","01:05:57,414",2.38,707,Uk is dying.
1,2,"01:05:58,162","01:06:01,832",3.67,708,We must find out what it is in the next two hours.
1,2,"01:06:08,255","01:06:09,335",1.08,709,Young Master Jang.
1,2,"01:06:10,174","01:06:11,304",1.13,710,Young Master Jang…
1,2,"01:06:13,386","01:06:14,596",1.21,711,Open his gate of energy.
1,2,"01:06:15,805","01:06:17,675",1.87,712,That is the only way.
1,2,"01:06:20,142","01:06:21,562",1.42,713,We are running out of time!
1,2,"01:06:22,186","01:06:23,306",1.12,714,Please…
1,2,"01:06:24,313","01:06:26,403",2.09,715,Please save Young Master Jang!
1,2,"01:06:41,122","01:06:42,582",1.46,716,My lord.
1,2,"01:06:41,122","01:06:42,582",1.46,717,How is Uk?
1,2,"01:06:42,665","01:06:44,285",1.62,718,Did something happen to him?
1,2,"01:06:44,375","01:06:46,285",1.91,719,Master Heo Yeom removed the poison.
1,2,"01:06:46,919","01:06:48,419",1.50,720,Young Master Jang is safe.
1,2,"01:06:49,005","01:06:51,585",2.58,721,Did he concoct the antidote?
1,2,"01:06:49,005","01:06:51,585",2.58,722,"No, my lord."
1,2,"01:06:52,341","01:06:55,431",3.09,723,He opened the young master's gate of energy.
1,2,"01:07:20,995","01:07:23,785",2.79,724,"Young Master Jang, are you awake?"
1,2,"01:07:35,926","01:07:37,846",1.92,725,Am I alive or dead?
1,2,"01:07:39,096","01:07:40,806",1.71,726,You barely made it out alive.
1,2,"01:07:40,890","01:07:45,809",4.92,727,Master Heo saved you by opening your gate of energy.
1,2,"01:07:48,230","01:07:49,900",1.67,728,He opened it?
1,2,"01:07:49,982","01:07:55,151",5.17,729,Mu-deok that lunatic would not tell us what kind of poison you took.
1,2,"01:07:55,237","01:07:59,027",3.79,730,So he had no choice but to do that to remove the poison.
1,2,"01:08:03,120","01:08:05,370",2.25,731,I am betting everything on you.
1,2,"01:08:05,998","01:08:09,168",3.17,732,So I hope you will survive.
1,2,"01:08:12,171","01:08:13,591",1.42,733,Where is Mu-deok?
1,2,"01:08:32,608","01:08:33,728",1.12,734,Mu-deok…
1,2,"01:08:40,407","01:08:41,657",1.25,735,Mu-deok!
1,2,"01:08:52,211","01:08:53,328",1.12,736,Mu-deok.
1,2,"01:08:56,674","01:08:57,844",1.17,737,Mu-deok.
1,2,"01:09:02,346","01:09:03,426",1.08,738,Mu-deok.
1,2,"01:09:18,028","01:09:19,738",1.71,739,Both of us could have died.
1,2,"01:09:20,614","01:09:21,744",1.13,740,You are…
1,2,"01:09:23,075","01:09:24,405",1.33,741,You are really crazy.
1,2,"01:09:27,580","01:09:32,213",4.63,742,So you survived… my pupil.
1,2,"01:09:38,507","01:09:39,757",1.25,743,That is right.
1,2,"01:09:41,677","01:09:43,467",1.79,744,I almost died thanks to you.
1,2,"01:09:50,019","01:09:51,769",1.75,745,My crazy master.
