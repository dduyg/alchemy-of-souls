1,3,"00:00:49,382","00:00:52,512",3.13,1,I forbid anyone from opening his gate of energy!
1,3,"00:00:59,684","00:01:00,694",1.01,2,Wait!
1,3,"00:01:03,063","00:01:05,113",2.05,3,You cannot just leave like this.
1,3,"00:01:05,690","00:01:07,400",1.71,4,What about this child?
1,3,"00:01:07,942","00:01:11,282",3.34,5,Think about what people will say about Do-hwa and this baby.
1,3,"00:01:11,821","00:01:13,661",1.84,6,They will say he is not your son
1,3,"00:01:14,532","00:01:16,992",2.46,7,and call him an illegitimate child.
1,3,"00:01:17,744","00:01:21,464",3.72,8,He will be raised by the Jang family since my wife gave birth to him.
1,3,"00:01:22,082","00:01:24,502",2.42,9,I will send someone over after his mother's funeral.
1,3,"00:01:24,584","00:01:26,044",1.46,10,Are you abandoning this child?
1,3,"00:01:27,420","00:01:28,590",1.17,11,Is he really
1,3,"00:01:29,380","00:01:30,880",1.50,12,not your son?
1,3,"00:01:33,301","00:01:35,471",2.17,13,Believe what you wish to believe.
1,3,"00:01:38,264","00:01:40,484",2.22,14,"If this child is only going to cause trouble,"
1,3,"00:01:40,558","00:01:42,308",1.75,15,let us just end his life here and now.
1,3,"00:01:52,028","00:01:54,488",2.46,16,See? He is your son.
1,3,"00:01:54,572","00:01:59,412",4.84,17,A son you are willing to protect even at the risk of your own life.
1,3,"00:01:59,994","00:02:01,754",1.76,18,I am merely trying to keep him safe.
1,3,"00:02:03,456","00:02:06,786",3.33,19,"If his gate of energy remains closed and he lives as my son, he will live."
1,3,"00:02:07,293","00:02:10,423",3.13,20,"However, if he chooses to discover his fate instead,"
1,3,"00:02:12,006","00:02:13,676",1.67,21,he will not survive.
1,3,"00:02:15,760","00:02:18,260",2.50,22,Who is the father
1,3,"00:02:19,722","00:02:20,852",1.13,23,of that child?
1,3,"00:02:25,395","00:02:27,515",2.12,24,He is the son of a dead man.
1,3,"00:02:31,025","00:02:33,105",2.08,25,"Not only does his birth make no sense,"
1,3,"00:02:33,903","00:02:35,953",2.05,26,but it never should have happened either.
1,3,"00:02:41,452","00:02:43,712",2.26,27,"Young Master, are you all right?"
1,3,"00:02:44,455","00:02:46,825",2.37,28,Why did you bring her out?
1,3,"00:02:46,916","00:02:48,166",1.25,29,Let her go.
1,3,"00:03:17,071","00:03:19,161",2.09,30,I apologize for causing trouble.
1,3,"00:03:19,240","00:03:21,410",2.17,31,Why did you bring her out?
1,3,"00:03:24,287","00:03:27,117",2.83,32,She tried to poison you.
1,3,"00:03:27,707","00:03:29,707",2.00,33,She did not poison me.
1,3,"00:03:30,919","00:03:32,379",1.46,34,I poisoned myself.
1,3,"00:03:34,964","00:03:38,724",3.76,35,I did it because I hated that I was incapable of casting spells.
1,3,"00:03:39,469","00:03:42,349",2.88,36,My maid only risked her life by doing what she was told to do.
1,3,"00:03:43,640","00:03:45,430",1.79,37,It was all my doing.
1,3,"00:03:53,983","00:03:57,033",3.05,38,"-Jang Uk, how could you? -Please save it for another time."
1,3,"00:03:57,111","00:04:00,911",3.80,39,He still has not recovered from the poison.
1,3,"00:04:00,990","00:04:04,490",3.50,40,"Punish him all you want, but wait until he has fully recovered."
1,3,"00:04:04,577","00:04:06,367",1.79,41,Uk almost died just now.
1,3,"00:04:06,454","00:04:08,714",2.26,42,Please do not scold him like that.
1,3,"00:04:08,790","00:04:10,460",1.67,43,Look at how pale he is.
1,3,"00:04:12,460","00:04:13,920",1.46,44,Take him home for now.
1,3,"00:04:14,003","00:04:16,133",2.13,45,"Young Master, let us go."
1,3,"00:04:16,214","00:04:18,014",1.80,46,Go to Sejukwon and receive treatment.
1,3,"00:04:18,091","00:04:19,631",1.54,47,Mu-deok needs to go too.
1,3,"00:04:20,218","00:04:21,798",1.58,48,Now is not the time.
1,3,"00:04:21,886","00:04:23,806",1.92,49,Mu-deok needs to get treatment too.
1,3,"00:04:23,888","00:04:25,468",1.58,50,"Otherwise, I will not go."
1,3,"00:04:25,556","00:04:26,766",1.21,51,Young Master.
1,3,"00:04:26,849","00:04:28,939",2.09,52,Fine. Go ahead and die!
1,3,"00:04:29,018","00:04:31,898",2.88,53,"-Lock them back up! -Calm down, Uncle."
1,3,"00:04:31,980","00:04:34,070",2.09,54,"If Uk is right, that maid did nothing wrong."
1,3,"00:04:34,899","00:04:36,029",1.13,55,She is severely injured.
1,3,"00:04:36,693","00:04:38,283",1.59,56,"Without treatment, she could die."
1,3,"00:04:38,361","00:04:41,611",3.25,57,I am surprised she is still alive even after all those beatings.
1,3,"00:04:42,198","00:04:44,908",2.71,58,"If she dies, I will allow you to hold a funeral for her."
1,3,"00:05:02,468","00:05:03,798",1.33,59,Please help.
1,3,"00:05:05,388","00:05:08,428",3.04,60,Mu-deok risked her life to do what I asked.
1,3,"00:05:08,516","00:05:11,096",2.58,61,We need to treat her at Sejukwon to save her life.
1,3,"00:05:12,854","00:05:14,154",1.30,62,Please help her.
1,3,"00:05:25,158","00:05:26,658",1.50,63,I want them out of my sight.
1,3,"00:05:27,452","00:05:29,622",2.17,64,Take them both to Sejukwon.
1,3,"00:05:32,623","00:05:33,543",0.92,65,Uk.
1,3,"00:05:36,210","00:05:39,210",3.00,66,"Young Master, go on ahead. I will take Mu-deok there."
1,3,"00:05:39,881","00:05:40,721",0.84,67,Mu-deok.
1,3,"00:05:41,758","00:05:43,378",1.62,68,"Mu-deok, wake up."
1,3,"00:06:04,030","00:06:05,530",1.50,69,-I will take her. -No.
1,3,"00:06:06,991","00:06:08,411",1.42,70,I will do it myself.
1,3,"00:06:08,493","00:06:09,953",1.46,71,You cannot even walk properly.
1,3,"00:06:10,828","00:06:13,708",2.88,72,"I can do it. She is my maid, so I will take her."
1,3,"00:06:13,790","00:06:15,420",1.63,73,But you are not well either.
1,3,"00:06:15,500","00:06:17,170",1.67,74,You cannot take her there.
1,3,"00:06:19,128","00:06:21,168",2.04,75,Do you think so? Then…
1,3,"00:06:22,340","00:06:24,840",2.50,76,-You carry her on your back. -Pardon?
1,3,"00:06:24,926","00:06:26,216",1.29,77,Carry her on your back.
1,3,"00:06:26,844","00:06:28,814",1.97,78,-You want me to carry her? -Yes.
1,3,"00:06:29,388","00:06:31,098",1.71,79,Why should I carry her?
1,3,"00:06:31,182","00:06:32,682",1.50,80,-Come here. -Young Master.
1,3,"00:06:33,184","00:06:35,354",2.17,81,"No, but wait. My goodness."
1,3,"00:06:35,937","00:06:37,057",1.12,82,"Oh, my goodness."
1,3,"00:06:37,146","00:06:40,396",3.25,83,"Hey, Yul. All right."
1,3,"00:06:40,483","00:06:42,073",1.59,84,Help me instead of Mu-deok.
1,3,"00:06:44,195","00:06:46,735",2.54,85,I do not have the strength to walk. Take me to Sejukwon.
1,3,"00:06:48,491","00:06:49,991",1.50,86,Do you want me to carry him?
1,3,"00:06:51,744","00:06:54,294",2.55,87,-No. -All right. Thank you.
1,3,"00:06:54,372","00:06:56,122",1.75,88,"Maidservant Kim, be careful!"
1,3,"00:06:56,207","00:06:57,747",1.54,89,-Be careful with her! -All right.
1,3,"00:06:57,834","00:06:58,714",0.88,90,-Goodness. -What…
1,3,"00:06:59,460","00:07:00,800",1.34,91,Be careful.
1,3,"00:07:01,629","00:07:02,629",1.00,92,"Oh, dear."
1,3,"00:07:04,090","00:07:05,630",1.54,93,Uk has opened
1,3,"00:07:07,093","00:07:09,643",2.55,94,his gate of energy in the end.
1,3,"00:07:10,847","00:07:11,927",1.08,95,Right.
1,3,"00:07:13,266","00:07:17,846",4.58,96,He was even willing to end his life. I could not just sit back and watch.
1,3,"00:07:18,646","00:07:21,436",2.79,97,I guess he knew that
1,3,"00:07:21,524","00:07:25,074",3.55,98,we would never just let him kill himself.
1,3,"00:07:25,945","00:07:28,525",2.58,99,He probably poisoned himself
1,3,"00:07:28,614","00:07:30,284",1.67,100,knowing he would get saved.
1,3,"00:07:34,328","00:07:35,618",1.29,101,Are you all right?
1,3,"00:07:37,874","00:07:40,794",2.92,102,Opening Uk's gate of energy and treating him
1,3,"00:07:40,877","00:07:43,627",2.75,103,has probably cost me ten years' worth of energy.
1,3,"00:07:44,672","00:07:48,802",4.13,104,"So you not only opened his gate of energy, but you even gave him extra energy?"
1,3,"00:07:48,885","00:07:52,425",3.54,105,What good would it be for an old man to keep his energy saved up?
1,3,"00:07:53,139","00:07:55,139",2.00,106,"He was poisoned,"
1,3,"00:07:55,224","00:07:57,854",2.63,107,so I gave him some energy to speed up his recovery.
1,3,"00:07:57,935","00:08:01,855",3.92,108,"Once Uk recovers, you must retrieve it no matter what."
1,3,"00:08:02,815","00:08:06,145",3.33,109,Is that really necessary now that his gate of energy is open?
1,3,"00:08:06,736","00:08:10,406",3.67,110,He is at least 20 years behind when it comes to knowing spells.
1,3,"00:08:10,490","00:08:12,910",2.42,111,"Even if he begins training himself now,"
1,3,"00:08:13,409","00:08:17,749",4.34,112,he will at least have to be 60 to do anything impressive.
1,3,"00:08:17,830","00:08:20,670",2.84,113,That is the fate he was given.
1,3,"00:08:22,543","00:08:24,053",1.51,114,We must make sure of it.
1,3,"00:08:25,796","00:08:29,086",3.29,115,"If that is what you wish, then I will retrieve it."
1,3,"00:08:29,175","00:08:30,295",1.12,116,You know what?
1,3,"00:08:31,177","00:08:33,887",2.71,117,I am too exhausted. I need a break.
1,3,"00:08:34,639","00:08:36,849",2.21,118,Bring me some wine.
1,3,"00:08:40,645","00:08:41,935",1.29,119,Wine?
1,3,"00:08:44,065","00:08:45,105",1.04,120,I mean…
1,3,"00:08:45,942","00:08:49,492",3.55,121,Why would there be wine in the room of a practitioner?
1,3,"00:08:49,570","00:08:50,820",1.25,122,I saw it.
1,3,"00:08:51,822","00:08:54,122",2.30,123,I saw it hidden in your room.
1,3,"00:08:54,700","00:08:57,540",2.84,124,Come on. The wine you drink whenever you get lonely.
1,3,"00:08:58,120","00:09:00,540",2.42,125,-I am not lonely! -My gosh.
1,3,"00:09:02,875","00:09:03,825",0.95,126,I am merely…
1,3,"00:09:03,918","00:09:05,128",1.21,127,"Gosh, I have a headache."
1,3,"00:09:06,003","00:09:07,053",1.05,128,It is because of…
1,3,"00:09:07,129","00:09:08,709",1.58,129,What was it called again?
1,3,"00:09:08,798","00:09:10,298",1.50,130,Right. Insomnia.
1,3,"00:09:10,925","00:09:12,715",1.79,131,I have very bad insomnia.
1,3,"00:09:14,971","00:09:16,681",1.71,132,I merely take it for that.
1,3,"00:09:22,895","00:09:26,475",3.58,133,Loneliness prevents you from falling asleep.
1,3,"00:09:26,566","00:09:28,856",2.29,134,You should have gotten married when you were young.
1,3,"00:09:29,652","00:09:34,572",4.92,135,Are you still not over Do-hwa? Is that why you are alone?
1,3,"00:09:46,335","00:09:47,415",1.08,136,It is empty.
1,3,"00:09:48,296","00:09:49,456",1.16,137,-What? -You finished it.
1,3,"00:09:50,881","00:09:53,261",2.38,138,That is not possible. What?
1,3,"00:09:57,346","00:09:58,506",1.16,139,What in the world…
1,3,"00:09:58,598","00:10:01,228",2.63,140,I guess you were unbelievably lonely.
1,3,"00:10:01,309","00:10:04,349",3.04,141,I only had a glass every time I could not sleep.
1,3,"00:10:04,979","00:10:06,559",1.58,142,I only had one glass each time…
1,3,"00:10:13,321","00:10:16,781",3.46,143,This is the wine that my uncle hides in his room.
1,3,"00:10:16,866","00:10:18,486",1.62,144,It tastes quite nice.
1,3,"00:10:19,243","00:10:22,713",3.47,145,"Anyway, Uk's life-long dream has finally come true."
1,3,"00:10:22,788","00:10:24,038",1.25,146,So let us celebrate.
1,3,"00:10:24,540","00:10:26,210",1.67,147,"That girl, Mu-deok…"
1,3,"00:10:26,292","00:10:28,342",2.05,148,"He recently brought her from a brothel, right?"
1,3,"00:10:30,129","00:10:33,339",3.21,149,She risked her life for him even though they only just met.
1,3,"00:10:35,593","00:10:36,643",1.05,150,It is strange.
1,3,"00:10:36,719","00:10:39,559",2.84,151,Uk saved her from having to become a gisaeng.
1,3,"00:10:39,639","00:10:42,929",3.29,152,She hated it so much that she even pretended to be blind.
1,3,"00:10:43,017","00:10:44,687",1.67,153,Have a drink.
1,3,"00:10:44,769","00:10:45,979",1.21,154,"""Blind""?"
1,3,"00:10:46,646","00:10:50,106",3.46,155,"Yes. According to Ju-wol, she was blind when she came"
1,3,"00:10:50,191","00:10:52,071",1.88,156,but could see just fine when she left.
1,3,"00:10:52,151","00:10:54,071",1.92,157,The wine tastes great.
1,3,"00:10:55,946","00:10:57,366",1.42,158,She easily deceives people.
1,3,"00:10:58,407","00:11:01,617",3.21,159,She lied about being blind and even said she poisoned Uk.
1,3,"00:11:02,953","00:11:05,253",2.30,160,She did not speak even though she was tortured.
1,3,"00:11:05,790","00:11:07,460",1.67,161,There is more to her than meets the eye.
1,3,"00:11:07,541","00:11:10,091",2.55,162,"On the outside, she just looks cute and naive."
1,3,"00:11:10,169","00:11:12,419",2.25,163,She seems to be hiding something.
1,3,"00:11:19,178","00:11:21,808",2.63,164,-You finished it. -What? What about it?
1,3,"00:11:23,182","00:11:25,562",2.38,165,"Your uncle is on his way here,"
1,3,"00:11:25,643","00:11:27,143",1.50,166,so I am guessing you are doomed.
1,3,"00:11:28,229","00:11:30,769",2.54,167,-I did not drink any. -Wait. Yul.
1,3,"00:11:30,856","00:11:31,936",1.08,168,Yul!
1,3,"00:11:34,693","00:11:36,073",1.38,169,"-Oh, gosh. -Dang-gu."
1,3,"00:11:38,155","00:11:39,485",1.33,170,I am dead.
1,3,"00:11:41,409","00:11:42,539",1.13,171,Dang-gu.
1,3,"00:11:44,495","00:11:45,615",1.12,172,"It was you, right?"
1,3,"00:11:46,330","00:11:47,250",0.92,173,No.
1,3,"00:11:52,545","00:11:53,915",1.37,174,Come here.
1,3,"00:11:54,672","00:11:56,552",1.88,175,"-Dang-gu. -Yes, Uncle?"
1,3,"00:12:06,183","00:12:07,563",1.38,176,Is she breathing?
1,3,"00:12:13,607","00:12:14,727",1.12,177,You are awake.
1,3,"00:12:15,526","00:12:17,896",2.37,178,"You kept passing out, so I thought you might die."
1,3,"00:12:21,574","00:12:22,664",1.09,179,Gosh.
1,3,"00:12:24,827","00:12:26,077",1.25,180,Does it hurt a lot?
1,3,"00:12:27,121","00:12:29,251",2.13,181,I think I broke my bones.
1,3,"00:12:29,832","00:12:31,082",1.25,182,They said you were fine.
1,3,"00:12:32,126","00:12:33,706",1.58,183,-Really? -Yes.
1,3,"00:12:34,253","00:12:36,633",2.38,184,Then why does it hurt so much?
1,3,"00:12:36,714","00:12:38,224",1.51,185,What a useless body.
1,3,"00:12:40,092","00:12:41,222",1.13,186,Hey.
1,3,"00:12:43,304","00:12:45,184",1.88,187,Why did you say you poisoned me?
1,3,"00:12:46,307","00:12:48,637",2.33,188,"If you pretended like you did not know anything,"
1,3,"00:12:48,726","00:12:50,476",1.75,189,they would not have tortured you.
1,3,"00:12:52,021","00:12:54,401",2.38,190,I had to make them believe that you were dying.
1,3,"00:12:54,940","00:12:57,530",2.59,191,"Otherwise, they would not have opened your gate of energy."
1,3,"00:12:58,194","00:13:00,034",1.84,192,They just would have made an antidote.
1,3,"00:13:01,572","00:13:03,622",2.05,193,So you really did risk your life.
1,3,"00:13:06,869","00:13:09,499",2.63,194,I thought I might lose at least an arm or a leg.
1,3,"00:13:10,289","00:13:11,959",1.67,195,But I am surprisingly fine.
1,3,"00:13:12,041","00:13:14,461",2.42,196,The people of Songrim are too nice.
1,3,"00:13:14,543","00:13:16,343",1.80,197,If this is how they torture people…
1,3,"00:13:19,340","00:13:20,420",1.08,198,"By the way,"
1,3,"00:13:21,258","00:13:23,718",2.46,199,you still seem pretty sick yourself.
1,3,"00:13:24,220","00:13:25,550",1.33,200,Why are you here?
1,3,"00:13:26,805","00:13:29,095",2.29,201,Obviously to take care of you.
1,3,"00:13:29,975","00:13:32,185",2.21,202,All the practitioners here are mages.
1,3,"00:13:32,269","00:13:33,849",1.58,203,They cannot find out about you.
1,3,"00:13:34,438","00:13:38,028",3.59,204,"So I closed the door when no one was looking,"
1,3,"00:13:38,108","00:13:41,608",3.50,205,"changed your clothes for you, applied ointment on your wounds,"
1,3,"00:13:41,695","00:13:44,195",2.50,206,and gave you a massage whenever you passed out.
1,3,"00:13:45,449","00:13:47,739",2.29,207,-You did? -Yes.
1,3,"00:13:52,164","00:13:55,964",3.80,208,I am the only person who is safe enough to come this close to you.
1,3,"00:14:27,074","00:14:28,334",1.26,209,"All my life,"
1,3,"00:14:29,201","00:14:32,081",2.88,210,no one ever seemed to know how desperate I was.
1,3,"00:14:34,957","00:14:36,917",1.96,211,No one has ever risked their lives for me
1,3,"00:14:38,085","00:14:39,415",1.33,212,like you did.
1,3,"00:14:52,766","00:14:55,936",3.17,213,"Since I survived as promised,"
1,3,"00:14:56,020","00:14:58,190",2.17,214,I will serve you as my master.
1,3,"00:15:06,322","00:15:08,742",2.42,215,"Up until now, I have served 12 masters."
1,3,"00:15:09,450","00:15:12,750",3.30,216,"People think I got kicked out every time, but I was the one who left."
1,3,"00:15:15,122","00:15:17,882",2.76,217,"But now, I have finally found my true master."
1,3,"00:15:18,459","00:15:20,879",2.42,218,So I shall kneel before you
1,3,"00:15:20,961","00:15:23,211",2.25,219,and swear to serve you as my master forever.
1,3,"00:15:25,341","00:15:26,721",1.38,220,On one condition.
1,3,"00:15:29,428","00:15:32,008",2.58,221,Do not tell anyone about our relationship.
1,3,"00:15:33,015","00:15:34,975",1.96,222,"You will continue to be my owner,"
1,3,"00:15:36,268","00:15:38,228",1.96,223,and I will continue to be your maid.
1,3,"00:15:41,815","00:15:42,895",1.08,224,"Also,"
1,3,"00:15:43,651","00:15:47,741",4.09,225,our relationship as master and pupil will only last until you become the best
1,3,"00:15:47,821","00:15:50,201",2.38,226,and help me get my energy back.
1,3,"00:15:52,284","00:15:53,544",1.26,227,Only until then.
1,3,"00:15:55,037","00:15:57,997",2.96,228,"The moment I get my energy back and become Naksu again,"
1,3,"00:16:00,000","00:16:02,540",2.54,229,we will no longer be master and pupil.
1,3,"00:16:03,587","00:16:05,417",1.83,230,Can you tell me why?
1,3,"00:16:08,842","00:16:10,092",1.25,231,"Because then,"
1,3,"00:16:11,095","00:16:13,465",2.37,232,"you should no longer have a reason to protect me,"
1,3,"00:16:14,515","00:16:16,345",1.83,233,nor should I have a reason…
1,3,"00:16:19,645","00:16:21,055",1.41,234,to go easy on you.
1,3,"00:16:30,072","00:16:32,702",2.63,235,So you want to part ways once our business is done?
1,3,"00:16:33,367","00:16:34,407",1.04,236,I see.
1,3,"00:16:37,329","00:16:38,409",1.08,237,All right.
1,3,"00:16:39,039","00:16:41,879",2.84,238,"Once I am no longer of use to you, you may abandon me."
1,3,"00:16:41,959","00:16:44,589",2.63,239,Then I will respect your decision and let you leave.
1,3,"00:16:51,093","00:16:53,553",2.46,240,"Now, kneel before your master."
1,3,"00:17:00,769","00:17:02,099",1.33,241,"I, Jang Uk, your pupil,"
1,3,"00:17:02,813","00:17:05,693",2.88,242,"will serve and protect my master, Mu-deok, with all my heart."
1,3,"00:18:25,395","00:18:27,515",2.12,243,You have returned to your true self.
1,3,"00:18:35,155","00:18:37,405",2.25,244,You will not run wild for a while.
1,3,"00:18:37,950","00:18:41,290",3.34,245,Then I shall meet you in the royal palace.
1,3,"00:18:50,462","00:18:53,052",2.59,246,Feeding human souls to soul shifters who run wild
1,3,"00:18:53,132","00:18:55,132",2.00,247,allow them to continue to be of use.
1,3,"00:18:57,302","00:19:00,222",2.92,248,Did you kill the gisaeng that Naksu's soul has shifted into?
1,3,"00:19:00,305","00:19:02,765",2.46,249,"Yes, we threw the body away in Lake Gyeongcheondaeho."
1,3,"00:19:02,850","00:19:04,850",2.00,250,Did you check for the blue mark?
1,3,"00:19:10,232","00:19:11,782",1.55,251,There is no blue mark.
1,3,"00:19:13,152","00:19:14,572",1.42,252,She is not Naksu.
1,3,"00:19:16,530","00:19:18,700",2.17,253,"Yes, I checked."
1,3,"00:19:18,782","00:19:22,242",3.46,254,"The Naksu I used to know would not have lost to you,"
1,3,"00:19:22,911","00:19:25,621",2.71,255,but she must have lost her energy due to the body she is in.
1,3,"00:19:26,165","00:19:29,455",3.29,256,Do soul shifters sometimes lose energy?
1,3,"00:19:30,586","00:19:31,876",1.29,257,"If a soul is too strong,"
1,3,"00:19:31,962","00:19:36,432",4.47,258,it enters an unbefitting body and cannot access its energy.
1,3,"00:19:36,508","00:19:38,258",1.75,259,Have you seen that before?
1,3,"00:19:47,269","00:19:48,439",1.17,260,Your Majesty.
1,3,"00:19:48,520","00:19:50,270",1.75,261,"I am Master Jang's pupil, Jin Mu."
1,3,"00:19:50,355","00:19:52,185",1.83,262,I heard you asked for me.
1,3,"00:20:02,576","00:20:03,576",1.00,263,Jin Mu.
1,3,"00:20:04,494","00:20:05,584",1.09,264,"Yes, Your Majesty."
1,3,"00:20:05,662","00:20:08,792",3.13,265,"I am not the king. I am your master, Jang Gang."
1,3,"00:20:09,499","00:20:12,289",2.79,266,"Right now, my soul has shifted into the king's body."
1,3,"00:20:22,387","00:20:25,017",2.63,267,"Master, is that you?"
1,3,"00:20:25,098","00:20:28,558",3.46,268,"Yes, the king and I have switched bodies."
1,3,"00:20:29,186","00:20:31,016",1.83,269,Then where is His Majesty?
1,3,"00:20:31,104","00:20:32,904",1.80,270,His soul is inside my body.
1,3,"00:20:33,482","00:20:35,572",2.09,271,I must get my body back.
1,3,"00:20:36,151","00:20:38,651",2.50,272,But I cannot seem to retrieve my energy.
1,3,"00:20:38,737","00:20:41,487",2.75,273,I need you to help me.
1,3,"00:20:43,200","00:20:44,280",1.08,274,Master.
1,3,"00:20:44,826","00:20:47,746",2.92,275,I do not know how the alchemy of souls works.
1,3,"00:20:48,580","00:20:52,580",4.00,276,Go to the Cheonbugwan Secret Room and bring me the Soul Ejector.
1,3,"00:20:53,085","00:20:56,205",3.12,277,I shall teach you the alchemy of souls.
1,3,"00:20:58,924","00:21:02,014",3.09,278,"He could not retrieve his energy due to the weak body he was in,"
1,3,"00:21:02,094","00:21:04,104",2.01,279,which was why I was given a chance.
1,3,"00:21:05,555","00:21:07,055",1.50,280,I was lucky.
1,3,"00:21:09,476","00:21:11,476",2.00,281,Burn these bodies.
1,3,"00:21:30,289","00:21:35,129",4.84,282,Search the brothel that the dead gisaeng used to work at.
1,3,"00:21:35,711","00:21:38,131",2.42,283,"Find the owner of the Spirit Plaque,"
1,3,"00:21:39,214","00:21:40,724",1.51,284,and do it discreetly.
1,3,"00:21:41,341","00:21:42,381",1.04,285,"Yes, sir."
1,3,"00:21:57,149","00:21:58,479",1.33,286,What are you doing?
1,3,"00:22:00,569","00:22:01,569",1.00,287,It is cold.
1,3,"00:22:02,279","00:22:04,239",1.96,288,It is freezing.
1,3,"00:22:04,323","00:22:07,083",2.76,289,"Of course, it is cold. So why are you sitting there?"
1,3,"00:22:09,578","00:22:12,078",2.50,290,I have never felt this cold before.
1,3,"00:22:12,748","00:22:15,918",3.17,291,I would easily collapse because my gate of energy was closed.
1,3,"00:22:16,001","00:22:18,211",2.21,292,"Even though I am shivering, I can stand."
1,3,"00:22:18,295","00:22:20,955",2.66,293,I guess my gate of energy is really open now.
1,3,"00:22:21,048","00:22:23,468",2.42,294,"If you master your spells, you will neither feel cold on ice"
1,3,"00:22:23,550","00:22:25,010",1.46,295,nor hot walking on fire.
1,3,"00:22:25,719","00:22:27,969",2.25,296,What were you like before you shifted souls?
1,3,"00:22:28,055","00:22:30,465",2.41,297,I had heard many rumors since you were so infamous.
1,3,"00:22:31,266","00:22:32,556",1.29,298,But I never actually saw you myself.
1,3,"00:22:32,642","00:22:34,942",2.30,299,I heard you were pretty strong.
1,3,"00:22:36,354","00:22:40,734",4.38,300,I was not just strong. I was extremely strong.
1,3,"00:22:41,401","00:22:43,031",1.63,301,"""Extremely""? I see."
1,3,"00:22:43,111","00:22:46,661",3.55,302,"In order to become the best mage, you must go through several steps."
1,3,"00:22:48,742","00:22:51,332",2.59,303,"First is Jipsu, the ability to gather the energy of water."
1,3,"00:22:57,167","00:23:00,167",3.00,304,"Second is Ryusu, the ability to gain energy from the flow of water."
1,3,"00:23:01,755","00:23:03,715",1.96,305,"Then comes Chisu, the ability to control the energy"
1,3,"00:23:06,093","00:23:07,223",1.13,306,in the atmosphere.
1,3,"00:23:07,928","00:23:11,388",3.46,307,I am a mage who has mastered all three steps.
1,3,"00:23:11,473","00:23:14,143",2.67,308,Not many in Daeho have mastered all three.
1,3,"00:23:14,726","00:23:17,936",3.21,309,I guess you really did live up to your name.
1,3,"00:23:18,688","00:23:19,728",1.04,310,Yes.
1,3,"00:23:20,524","00:23:22,784",2.26,311,"I moved silently like a shadow,"
1,3,"00:23:23,485","00:23:27,445",3.96,312,and the heads of my enemies fell to the ground where I passed.
1,3,"00:23:28,156","00:23:29,696",1.54,313,"I was Naksu,"
1,3,"00:23:30,951","00:23:32,541",1.59,314,the Shadow Assassin.
1,3,"00:23:45,423","00:23:47,433",2.01,315,"I walked on water like I was flying,"
1,3,"00:23:48,385","00:23:50,715",2.33,316,and the wind blew as I passed by.
1,3,"00:24:08,321","00:24:11,871",3.55,317,"If I did this, it would rain."
1,3,"00:24:15,745","00:24:19,455",3.71,318,"I am Naksu, the best mage in this land,"
1,3,"00:24:20,041","00:24:23,041",3.00,319,who even has the ability to create snow and rain…
1,3,"00:24:27,090","00:24:28,430",1.34,320,Are you all right?
1,3,"00:24:30,594","00:24:32,054",1.46,321,"All I did was run for a bit,"
1,3,"00:24:32,888","00:24:35,928",3.04,322,but it feels like my lungs are going to explode.
1,3,"00:24:40,812","00:24:41,732",0.92,323,What is the matter?
1,3,"00:24:41,813","00:24:43,903",2.09,324,I have cramps!
1,3,"00:24:43,982","00:24:44,942",0.96,325,You have cramps?
1,3,"00:24:45,025","00:24:48,235",3.21,326,"These legs are short, skinny, weak, and cannot stand the cold."
1,3,"00:24:49,029","00:24:50,859",1.83,327,What a useless body.
1,3,"00:24:52,908","00:24:56,748",3.84,328,"Be careful. You are no longer Naksu, the Shadow Assassin."
1,3,"00:24:56,828","00:24:58,868",2.04,329,"You are Mu-deok, our family maid."
1,3,"00:24:58,955","00:25:02,075",3.12,330,You should not run around like you did earlier.
1,3,"00:25:02,751","00:25:03,751",1.00,331,You could get hurt.
1,3,"00:25:05,128","00:25:06,668",1.54,332,I feel miserable.
1,3,"00:25:10,634","00:25:12,764",2.13,333,Do not feel miserable. You have me.
1,3,"00:25:12,844","00:25:15,814",2.97,334,Let us begin training now that my gate of energy is open.
1,3,"00:25:15,889","00:25:18,139",2.25,335,"But first, put your shoes back on. It is cold."
1,3,"00:25:33,281","00:25:34,661",1.38,336,What was that for?
1,3,"00:25:35,242","00:25:36,532",1.29,337,You are not agile.
1,3,"00:25:37,911","00:25:38,751",0.84,338,Pick it up.
1,3,"00:25:42,165","00:25:43,285",1.12,339,What are you doing?
1,3,"00:25:44,292","00:25:47,712",3.42,340,Let me see how good my pupil is so I can forget how miserable I feel.
1,3,"00:25:47,796","00:25:48,956",1.16,341,What?
1,3,"00:26:02,352","00:26:03,652",1.30,342,Why did you hit me?
1,3,"00:26:03,728","00:26:05,728",2.00,343,You have no swordsmanship.
1,3,"00:26:06,231","00:26:07,321",1.09,344,Then show me how you fight.
1,3,"00:26:23,665","00:26:24,665",1.00,345,You little…
1,3,"00:26:25,250","00:26:26,290",1.04,346,"Gosh, that hurts."
1,3,"00:26:38,805","00:26:40,345",1.54,347,You fight poorly too.
1,3,"00:26:42,058","00:26:44,558",2.50,348,You are worse than what I had expected.
1,3,"00:26:44,644","00:26:47,484",2.84,349,That is because I never learned properly!
1,3,"00:26:51,651","00:26:53,611",1.96,350,You had 12 masters.
1,3,"00:26:54,237","00:26:56,697",2.46,351,"You may not have been able to learn how to cast spells,"
1,3,"00:26:56,781","00:27:00,161",3.38,352,but you could have learned basic martial arts.
1,3,"00:27:00,243","00:27:02,413",2.17,353,I did not feel motivated to do so.
1,3,"00:27:02,495","00:27:03,495",1.00,354,"As you already know,"
1,3,"00:27:03,580","00:27:05,830",2.25,355,I need to feel motivated in order to do something.
1,3,"00:27:06,666","00:27:07,826",1.16,356,Because you are lazy.
1,3,"00:27:08,335","00:27:12,085",3.75,357,I have noticed that you never do anything around the house.
1,3,"00:27:12,172","00:27:14,302",2.13,358,I know everything by heart. Test me.
1,3,"00:27:14,382","00:27:16,012",1.63,359,How do you think I recognized you?
1,3,"00:27:16,092","00:27:18,602",2.51,360,It was because I saw you using Tansu. I know it all.
1,3,"00:27:19,095","00:27:20,345",1.25,361,You are all talk.
1,3,"00:27:20,430","00:27:21,930",1.50,362,I can do more than talk now.
1,3,"00:27:24,768","00:27:26,638",1.87,363,Did you just see that?
1,3,"00:27:26,728","00:27:28,358",1.63,364,I am a quick learner.
1,3,"00:27:28,438","00:27:31,318",2.88,365,I will quickly master Jipsu. How long does it take?
1,3,"00:27:31,399","00:27:33,529",2.13,366,"I was a fast learner, but I took five years."
1,3,"00:27:33,610","00:27:35,400",1.79,367,Those who are slow take 20 years.
1,3,"00:27:35,487","00:27:36,607",1.12,368,As for you…
1,3,"00:27:38,156","00:27:40,116",1.96,369,You may master it pretty quickly
1,3,"00:27:40,784","00:27:42,164",1.38,370,since you are Jang Gang's son.
1,3,"00:27:43,203","00:27:45,123",1.92,371,What does he have to do with this?
1,3,"00:27:45,205","00:27:48,075",2.87,372,He was a genius who only took a year to master Jipsu.
1,3,"00:27:48,792","00:27:50,092",1.30,373,"If you achieve that,"
1,3,"00:27:50,168","00:27:52,748",2.58,374,rumors that say you are not his son will subside.
1,3,"00:27:52,837","00:27:54,957",2.12,375,"But of course, I doubt it will be possible."
1,3,"00:27:55,465","00:27:57,625",2.16,376,"If he took a year, I will do it in six months."
1,3,"00:27:57,717","00:27:59,587",1.87,377,"No, I will do it in three months."
1,3,"00:28:00,178","00:28:01,008",0.83,378,You are bluffing.
1,3,"00:28:01,096","00:28:04,016",2.92,379,"I am determined, so do not discourage me."
1,3,"00:28:07,936","00:28:10,186",2.25,380,Maidservant Kim asked me to sweep the entire yard.
1,3,"00:28:10,688","00:28:12,188",1.50,381,"You have recovered a lot,"
1,3,"00:28:12,273","00:28:15,193",2.92,382,"and you seem to be doing better, so help me out."
1,3,"00:28:18,154","00:28:19,034",0.88,383,What…
1,3,"00:28:20,824","00:28:22,124",1.30,384,Mu-deok.
1,3,"00:28:22,200","00:28:26,580",4.38,385,I am a lazy guy who does not do things he does not feel motivated to do.
1,3,"00:28:28,456","00:28:29,576",1.12,386,Good luck.
1,3,"00:28:30,834","00:28:31,924",1.09,387,That little…
1,3,"00:28:32,001","00:28:34,091",2.09,388,-That… -It is cold. How chilly.
1,3,"00:28:34,170","00:28:36,510",2.34,389,"That lazy, useless show-off!"
1,3,"00:28:36,589","00:28:39,799",3.21,390,It is so chilly. It is way too cold.
1,3,"00:28:44,139","00:28:49,059",4.92,391,Master Heo has made herbal medicine for Uk.
1,3,"00:28:49,602","00:28:51,192",1.59,392,It seems to be extremely effective
1,3,"00:28:51,271","00:28:55,071",3.80,393,now that Young Master's gate of energy is open.
1,3,"00:28:56,192","00:29:00,412",4.22,394,"Maidservant Kim, you seem very delighted."
1,3,"00:29:01,948","00:29:05,288",3.34,395,Are you really that upset that his gate of energy is open?
1,3,"00:29:07,120","00:29:10,250",3.13,396,You did not do anything even when he was about to die.
1,3,"00:29:11,332","00:29:15,132",3.80,397,"If not for Master Heo, Young Master Jang would have died."
1,3,"00:29:15,211","00:29:19,051",3.84,398,He should have looked for a way to save him without opening his gate.
1,3,"00:29:19,132","00:29:20,382",1.25,399,How cold of you.
1,3,"00:29:21,176","00:29:24,046",2.87,400,You have always kept a distance from Young Master Jang.
1,3,"00:29:24,137","00:29:25,137",1.00,401,Is it…
1,3,"00:29:26,222","00:29:27,472",1.25,402,because of the rumors?
1,3,"00:29:33,438","00:29:35,398",1.96,403,What rumors?
1,3,"00:29:35,482","00:29:36,732",1.25,404,"Of course, you would know."
1,3,"00:29:37,525","00:29:39,525",2.00,405,You know that there are rumors going around
1,3,"00:29:39,611","00:29:42,911",3.30,406,saying you are the father of Young Master Jang.
1,3,"00:29:44,365","00:29:46,945",2.58,407,Do not dare to speak of
1,3,"00:29:48,745","00:29:50,785",2.04,408,such absurd rumors!
1,3,"00:29:51,706","00:29:53,496",1.79,409,It is not completely absurd.
1,3,"00:29:53,583","00:29:56,713",3.13,410,Let us be honest. We both know that
1,3,"00:29:56,795","00:29:59,625",2.83,411,you used to fancy Madam Do-hwa before she got married.
1,3,"00:30:00,215","00:30:03,925",3.71,412,You used to write her poems and give her gifts.
1,3,"00:30:04,010","00:30:05,180",1.17,413,I am a living witness.
1,3,"00:30:05,929","00:30:09,219",3.29,414,People say you are still single because you are not yet over her.
1,3,"00:30:10,099","00:30:11,559",1.46,415,"What about you, Maidservant Kim?"
1,3,"00:30:12,227","00:30:14,937",2.71,416,Are you still head over heels for Jang Gang?
1,3,"00:30:15,522","00:30:19,232",3.71,417,Is that why you are unmarried and still living in his house?
1,3,"00:30:19,859","00:30:20,689",0.83,418,What?
1,3,"00:30:20,777","00:30:24,737",3.96,419,I know very well how much you used to like him.
1,3,"00:30:26,074","00:30:28,124",2.05,420,"When he told you that he liked acorn jelly,"
1,3,"00:30:28,201","00:30:29,951",1.75,421,you climbed mountains to collect acorns
1,3,"00:30:30,036","00:30:31,956",1.92,422,-like some kind of a squirrel. -A squirrel?
1,3,"00:30:32,038","00:30:34,418",2.38,423,I saw you going around collecting acorns.
1,3,"00:30:38,545","00:30:39,545",1.00,424,What is your point?
1,3,"00:30:40,588","00:30:44,838",4.25,425,Are you making fun of the fact that I went around collecting acorns?
1,3,"00:30:47,136","00:30:48,296",1.16,426,Fine!
1,3,"00:30:48,930","00:30:51,430",2.50,427,I admit I went here and there to collect acorns.
1,3,"00:30:52,016","00:30:55,846",3.83,428,Making acorn jelly was the only way I could express my feelings for him.
1,3,"00:30:56,729","00:30:59,069",2.34,429,You can mock me all you want.
1,3,"00:31:06,406","00:31:07,486",1.08,430,I am not mocking you.
1,3,"00:31:09,450","00:31:11,620",2.17,431,Seeing you make all that acorn jelly…
1,3,"00:31:13,538","00:31:14,828",1.29,432,made me feel sad.
1,3,"00:31:17,375","00:31:19,085",1.71,433,I know how it feels
1,3,"00:31:19,711","00:31:22,801",3.09,434,to be in a situation where you cannot do anything
1,3,"00:31:23,548","00:31:24,798",1.25,435,for the person you love.
1,3,"00:31:27,176","00:31:28,296",1.12,436,Other people can say
1,3,"00:31:28,970","00:31:31,560",2.59,437,"what they want to say about us behind our backs,"
1,3,"00:31:32,223","00:31:35,643",3.42,438,but let us not do the same to each other.
1,3,"00:31:38,229","00:31:41,569",3.34,439,It is obvious to us both that the passionate love we had
1,3,"00:31:42,817","00:31:45,397",2.58,440,back when we were young
1,3,"00:31:46,988","00:31:48,908",1.92,441,only ended up leaving a scar in our hearts.
1,3,"00:31:53,870","00:31:57,290",3.42,442,I got too worked up about Young Master Jang
1,3,"00:31:58,166","00:32:00,246",2.08,443,and said things I should not have said.
1,3,"00:32:00,335","00:32:01,625",1.29,444,Forgive me.
1,3,"00:32:03,087","00:32:05,917",2.83,445,I also care for Uk greatly.
1,3,"00:32:06,007","00:32:09,677",3.67,446,I am just afraid that opening his gate of energy
1,3,"00:32:10,678","00:32:14,308",3.63,447,might have broken the barrier that is protecting him.
1,3,"00:32:14,390","00:32:16,480",2.09,448,It just makes me feel anxious.
1,3,"00:32:17,560","00:32:19,980",2.42,449,I may have to break his will
1,3,"00:32:21,814","00:32:24,444",2.63,450,and stop him in the future.
1,3,"00:32:26,903","00:32:29,283",2.38,451,Please do not resent me for that.
1,3,"00:32:31,699","00:32:32,989",1.29,452,Let us see how things go.
1,3,"00:32:40,875","00:32:43,585",2.71,453,"Young Master, this is wild ginseng tea."
1,3,"00:32:44,170","00:32:45,460",1.29,454,Drink up.
1,3,"00:32:45,546","00:32:46,666",1.12,455,"""Wild ginseng""?"
1,3,"00:32:47,298","00:32:49,008",1.71,456,I will drink it after I return. Leave it.
1,3,"00:32:49,092","00:32:50,262",1.17,457,Are you trying
1,3,"00:32:50,843","00:32:52,433",1.59,458,to give it to Mu-deok again?
1,3,"00:32:53,012","00:32:55,642",2.63,459,It is cold outside. She deserves something nice and warm.
1,3,"00:32:56,474","00:32:59,024",2.55,460,Why did you make her sweep the yard out in the cold?
1,3,"00:33:00,353","00:33:01,403",1.05,461,Wait.
1,3,"00:33:02,313","00:33:04,613",2.30,462,That maid is getting treated for free.
1,3,"00:33:04,691","00:33:06,611",1.92,463,So I asked her to do her part.
1,3,"00:33:06,693","00:33:09,493",2.80,464,Why does it have to be her? Could you not do it instead?
1,3,"00:33:10,655","00:33:13,525",2.87,465,"I need to heat up your medicine, prepare your meals,"
1,3,"00:33:13,616","00:33:14,736",1.12,466,and take care of you.
1,3,"00:33:14,826","00:33:17,286",2.46,467,Mu-deok will take care of me. You do not need to worry.
1,3,"00:33:20,456","00:33:21,706",1.25,468,"Oh, I see."
1,3,"00:33:21,791","00:33:24,001",2.21,469,So you only care about Mu-deok.
1,3,"00:33:25,503","00:33:27,093",1.59,470,"Since I am now considered useless,"
1,3,"00:33:27,171","00:33:30,931",3.76,471,I will go outside and sweep the yard just like Mu-deok.
1,3,"00:33:33,761","00:33:38,391",4.63,472,It is just that I feel like I am putting you through a lot.
1,3,"00:33:38,474","00:33:41,564",3.09,473,How long did it take for you to boil this wild ginseng?
1,3,"00:33:41,644","00:33:43,524",1.88,474,I boiled it for the entire day.
1,3,"00:33:43,604","00:33:46,154",2.55,475,That is my point. You did not get to sleep a wink.
1,3,"00:33:46,232","00:33:48,902",2.67,476,How do you think that makes me feel?
1,3,"00:33:50,111","00:33:51,951",1.84,477,-Not good. -Right?
1,3,"00:33:52,030","00:33:55,450",3.42,478,I know I put you through a lot with all the trouble I caused.
1,3,"00:33:56,826","00:34:00,906",4.08,479,Look at how tired you look. You used to have porcelain skin.
1,3,"00:34:01,581","00:34:03,711",2.13,480,You should be the one drinking this wild ginseng tea.
1,3,"00:34:03,791","00:34:07,051",3.26,481,So will you stop causing so much trouble?
1,3,"00:34:07,128","00:34:08,958",1.83,482,I do not know what to say to the leader.
1,3,"00:34:09,547","00:34:10,967",1.42,483,"If he punishes me, so be it."
1,3,"00:34:11,549","00:34:14,889",3.34,484,"My gates are open now, which means I will be a part of Songrim."
1,3,"00:34:17,638","00:34:21,098",3.46,485,Are you that happy that your gates of energy are open?
1,3,"00:34:21,726","00:34:23,346",1.62,486,"Yes, I am."
1,3,"00:34:24,103","00:34:27,153",3.05,487,"Once I enter Songrim and become better than Yul and Dang-gu,"
1,3,"00:34:27,231","00:34:29,651",2.42,488,they will regret not having taken me in sooner.
1,3,"00:34:33,654","00:34:35,534",1.88,489,"Maidservant Kim, you can have the ginseng."
1,3,"00:34:36,282","00:34:38,622",2.34,490,Thank you for the ginseng. I appreciate it.
1,3,"00:34:38,701","00:34:39,831",1.13,491,-Sure. -Thanks.
1,3,"00:34:53,841","00:34:56,721",2.88,492,You must be the spiteful maid.
1,3,"00:34:56,803","00:34:58,763",1.96,493,What are you doing? We gave you treatment.
1,3,"00:34:58,846","00:35:00,006",1.16,494,Your wounds could get infected.
1,3,"00:35:00,098","00:35:02,808",2.71,495,"I got treated for free,"
1,3,"00:35:02,892","00:35:05,442",2.55,496,so I was told to work to show gratitude.
1,3,"00:35:05,520","00:35:07,560",2.04,497,Maidservant Kim is a wise woman.
1,3,"00:35:08,064","00:35:11,154",3.09,498,Sweep the yard nice and clean. Then manure the medicinal herb garden.
1,3,"00:35:12,026","00:35:13,026",1.00,499,All right.
1,3,"00:35:14,320","00:35:15,570",1.25,500,"You just wait, Heo Yeom."
1,3,"00:35:15,655","00:35:18,025",2.37,501,"Right now, I may be sweeping your front yard."
1,3,"00:35:18,116","00:35:19,986",1.87,502,"But one day, I will get rid of Sejukwon."
1,3,"00:35:23,496","00:35:25,536",2.04,503,Hey! Watch it.
1,3,"00:35:25,623","00:35:27,253",1.63,504,Was that on purpose?
1,3,"00:35:27,875","00:35:28,745",0.87,505,No.
1,3,"00:35:28,835","00:35:30,705",1.87,506,I think it was on purpose.
1,3,"00:35:30,795","00:35:31,955",1.16,507,That is absurd.
1,3,"00:35:36,008","00:35:37,798",1.79,508,You are an odd one.
1,3,"00:35:38,594","00:35:39,854",1.26,509,This ear…
1,3,"00:35:39,929","00:35:42,809",2.88,510,I have seen this ear before.
1,3,"00:35:45,309","00:35:48,809",3.50,511,Have I ever treated you before?
1,3,"00:35:50,398","00:35:53,478",3.08,512,How would I be able to afford getting treated at Sejukwon?
1,3,"00:35:56,320","00:35:59,490",3.17,513,This ear looks familiar somehow.
1,3,"00:36:04,787","00:36:06,407",1.62,514,Sweep the yard properly.
1,3,"00:36:09,584","00:36:10,924",1.34,515,He almost ripped my ear out.
1,3,"00:36:11,752","00:36:13,302",1.55,516,"I know it hurts, but bear with it."
1,3,"00:36:13,379","00:36:16,719",3.34,517,He is angry with Young Master Jang and is taking it out on you.
1,3,"00:36:16,799","00:36:20,929",4.13,518,It is normal to pick on the weak. That is how the world works.
1,3,"00:36:21,012","00:36:23,062",2.05,519,I will just stay quiet.
1,3,"00:36:23,139","00:36:25,179",2.04,520,"If that is the case, try not to resent him."
1,3,"00:36:25,266","00:36:27,136",1.87,521,He gave ten years' worth of his torrent of energy
1,3,"00:36:27,226","00:36:29,186",1.96,522,to help your young master heal faster.
1,3,"00:36:29,937","00:36:31,807",1.87,523,Get some rest once you are done.
1,3,"00:36:35,693","00:36:37,743",2.05,524,Ten years' worth of his torrent of energy?
1,3,"00:36:49,373","00:36:51,003",1.63,525,What took you so long?
1,3,"00:36:51,083","00:36:53,213",2.13,526,Come here. This is wild ginseng--
1,3,"00:36:54,128","00:36:55,208",1.08,527,"What is it, Mu-deok?"
1,3,"00:36:55,296","00:36:57,006",1.71,528,What are you doing?
1,3,"00:36:57,882","00:36:59,052",1.17,529,Stay still.
1,3,"00:36:59,926","00:37:01,926",2.00,530,This is not what I had in mind when I brought you here.
1,3,"00:37:02,011","00:37:04,261",2.25,531,"Mu-deok, this is wrong. I am your pupil. Stop it."
1,3,"00:37:06,641","00:37:07,851",1.21,532,My gosh.
1,3,"00:37:12,897","00:37:14,397",1.50,533,What are you doing right now?
1,3,"00:37:14,482","00:37:15,822",1.34,534,I am checking the core of your energy.
1,3,"00:37:17,902","00:37:19,032",1.13,535,Breathe properly.
1,3,"00:37:35,962","00:37:37,212",1.25,536,It is there.
1,3,"00:37:38,965","00:37:40,255",1.29,537,It really is inside.
1,3,"00:37:41,509","00:37:43,009",1.50,538,You really are special.
1,3,"00:37:43,678","00:37:44,888",1.21,539,Cut it out.
1,3,"00:37:45,513","00:37:47,393",1.88,540,What is inside my stomach?
1,3,"00:37:47,473","00:37:48,933",1.46,541,A great torrent of energy.
1,3,"00:37:49,600","00:37:51,890",2.29,542,Heo Yeom placed a torrent of energy in your stomach.
1,3,"00:37:53,854","00:37:55,234",1.38,543,A torrent of energy?
1,3,"00:38:03,572","00:38:06,162",2.59,544,Uk seems to have recovered now.
1,3,"00:38:06,242","00:38:08,872",2.63,545,It is time you retrieve the torrent of energy you gave him.
1,3,"00:38:08,953","00:38:12,043",3.09,546,"If it surges the wrong way, it could make him go mad."
1,3,"00:38:12,748","00:38:15,578",2.83,547,Uk will not be able to use it.
1,3,"00:38:16,460","00:38:18,630",2.17,548,His gate of energy just opened.
1,3,"00:38:18,713","00:38:21,133",2.42,549,There is nothing he can actually do.
1,3,"00:38:21,215","00:38:22,585",1.37,550,You are worried for nothing.
1,3,"00:38:23,259","00:38:27,719",4.46,551,He probably does not even know that there is something great inside him.
1,3,"00:38:30,683","00:38:32,773",2.09,552,Let us steal Heo Yeom's torrent of energy.
1,3,"00:38:34,854","00:38:38,324",3.47,553,The core of your energy is filled with the energy that Heo Yeom gave you.
1,3,"00:38:39,275","00:38:41,355",2.08,554,You are now strong enough to use Jipsu with ease.
1,3,"00:38:41,444","00:38:44,204",2.76,555,I had no idea that something so precious was inside me.
1,3,"00:38:44,280","00:38:47,580",3.30,556,It takes ten years to gather this kind of torrent. You got it for free.
1,3,"00:38:47,658","00:38:49,868",2.21,557,"And it is Heo Yeom's, the best you could ask for."
1,3,"00:38:50,745","00:38:52,115",1.37,558,You are one lucky punk.
1,3,"00:38:52,204","00:38:56,464",4.26,559,I thought that old man hated me. I am surprised he gave me this.
1,3,"00:38:56,542","00:38:59,552",3.01,560,He probably gave it to you to help you recover.
1,3,"00:38:59,628","00:39:00,878",1.25,561,He will take it back soon.
1,3,"00:39:00,963","00:39:04,343",3.38,562,"He cannot do that. It is in my stomach, so it is mine."
1,3,"00:39:04,425","00:39:06,505",2.08,563,"If you do not have the power to control it,"
1,3,"00:39:06,594","00:39:09,474",2.88,564,it cannot become yours. He can take it back whenever.
1,3,"00:39:09,555","00:39:12,175",2.62,565,"To keep this, I need to be able to control energy,"
1,3,"00:39:12,266","00:39:15,266",3.00,566,which means I need to breathe just like the source of the energy.
1,3,"00:39:16,062","00:39:19,112",3.05,567,I guess those 12 masters taught you a thing or two.
1,3,"00:39:20,191","00:39:21,281",1.09,568,Correct.
1,3,"00:39:22,568","00:39:25,568",3.00,569,The energy from your core is controlled by your breathing.
1,3,"00:39:25,654","00:39:27,874",2.22,570,"However, every mage breathes differently."
1,3,"00:39:27,948","00:39:31,618",3.67,571,There is a difference in how much air one breathes in and out.
1,3,"00:39:32,745","00:39:36,495",3.75,572,"It is Heo Yeom's energy, so we must control it with his breathing."
1,3,"00:39:37,416","00:39:39,376",1.96,573,I doubt he will teach me.
1,3,"00:39:39,460","00:39:42,590",3.13,574,"Should we just try everything? After all, it is just breathing."
1,3,"00:39:43,339","00:39:46,719",3.38,575,"If you use someone else's breathing, you could lose control and go mad."
1,3,"00:39:47,468","00:39:51,638",4.17,576,You will shed blood from every hole in your body and die.
1,3,"00:39:51,722","00:39:53,022",1.30,577,Should we still try?
1,3,"00:39:54,225","00:39:55,055",0.83,578,No.
1,3,"00:39:55,810","00:39:58,270",2.46,579,You are way too extreme.
1,3,"00:39:59,146","00:40:02,316",3.17,580,"Think of a way to keep me alive along with this energy, Master."
1,3,"00:40:03,567","00:40:07,987",4.42,581,The most basic breathing skill is handed down to you by your family.
1,3,"00:40:08,072","00:40:09,992",1.92,582,Heo Yeom is a member of the Seo family.
1,3,"00:40:10,074","00:40:13,204",3.13,583,So anyone from that family will use the same breathing technique.
1,3,"00:40:16,539","00:40:17,709",1.17,584,-Seo Yul. -Seo Yul.
1,3,"00:40:26,298","00:40:28,508",2.21,585,Go ask him. You said you were close.
1,3,"00:40:28,592","00:40:30,142",1.55,586,Yul is a careful guy.
1,3,"00:40:30,719","00:40:34,009",3.29,587,"If I ask, he will catch on and tell Heo Yeom."
1,3,"00:40:35,766","00:40:37,176",1.41,588,Just ten breaths…
1,3,"00:40:37,268","00:40:39,978",2.71,589,"No, seven will be enough."
1,3,"00:40:40,062","00:40:42,902",2.84,590,I will be able to know by putting a hand on his core of energy.
1,3,"00:40:43,691","00:40:45,861",2.17,591,He will break your hand before his first breath.
1,3,"00:40:46,527","00:40:49,277",2.75,592,You have a point. He is not like you.
1,3,"00:40:50,614","00:40:51,704",1.09,593,Me?
1,3,"00:40:52,992","00:40:53,992",1.00,594,What is wrong with me?
1,3,"00:40:56,078","00:40:59,458",3.38,595,What? What is with that condescending look?
1,3,"00:40:59,540","00:41:02,880",3.34,596,"Anyway, I do not think I can do to him what I did to you."
1,3,"00:41:02,960","00:41:04,420",1.46,597,"No, wait. Mu-deok."
1,3,"00:41:04,503","00:41:06,053",1.55,598,Look at me in the eyes.
1,3,"00:41:06,130","00:41:09,470",3.34,599,So you feel uneasy about touching him unlike how you felt with me?
1,3,"00:41:09,550","00:41:12,140",2.59,600,You are so immature. How is that even important?
1,3,"00:41:12,720","00:41:13,800",1.08,601,"""Immature""?"
1,3,"00:41:15,264","00:41:16,684",1.42,602,"Yes, it is important."
1,3,"00:41:16,765","00:41:18,675",1.91,603,Are you insane? What are you doing?
1,3,"00:41:18,767","00:41:19,597",0.83,604,I am sane.
1,3,"00:41:19,685","00:41:22,015",2.33,605,"-No, let us say I am insane. -Let go of me."
1,3,"00:41:24,899","00:41:25,769",0.87,606,What are you doing?
1,3,"00:41:27,443","00:41:28,363",0.92,607,Hey.
1,3,"00:41:30,362","00:41:33,372",3.01,608,Why do you keep badgering Mu-deok?
1,3,"00:41:33,991","00:41:35,031",1.04,609,She is still sick.
1,3,"00:41:35,117","00:41:37,157",2.04,610,I was not badgering her.
1,3,"00:41:38,704","00:41:40,214",1.51,611,-Seriously? -Goodness.
1,3,"00:41:40,289","00:41:41,869",1.58,612,I thought you were being nice.
1,3,"00:41:43,209","00:41:44,789",1.58,613,"Mu-deok, are you all right?"
1,3,"00:41:46,670","00:41:49,260",2.59,614,"Your young master expects a lot from you, does he not?"
1,3,"00:41:49,340","00:41:52,550",3.21,615,"You not only need to care for him, but you must keep him amused too."
1,3,"00:41:52,635","00:41:54,845",2.21,616,"He asks for warm water, but when I bring it,"
1,3,"00:41:54,929","00:41:56,349",1.42,617,he asks for cold water again…
1,3,"00:41:56,430","00:41:58,310",1.88,618,"-Hey, that-- -He says something is salty,"
1,3,"00:41:58,390","00:42:00,060",1.67,619,"but later on, he complains it is bland."
1,3,"00:42:00,142","00:42:02,442",2.30,620,-Me? -He is immature and fickle.
1,3,"00:42:02,520","00:42:04,900",2.38,621,He is lazy but full of himself.
1,3,"00:42:05,773","00:42:07,073",1.30,622,But what can I do?
1,3,"00:42:07,149","00:42:08,439",1.29,623,"He is my young master,"
1,3,"00:42:08,526","00:42:10,486",1.96,624,so I have no choice but to serve him.
1,3,"00:42:11,153","00:42:13,493",2.34,625,"Mu-deok, you seem to know a lot about him already."
1,3,"00:42:13,572","00:42:14,912",1.34,626,I am embarrassed for you.
1,3,"00:42:16,075","00:42:20,115",4.04,627,"Anyway, what are you two doing here? Why are you not at Sejukwon?"
1,3,"00:42:23,874","00:42:26,504",2.63,628,We were looking at Yul.
1,3,"00:42:26,585","00:42:27,795",1.21,629,Mu-deok asked me to come.
1,3,"00:42:30,214","00:42:31,224",1.01,630,Yul?
1,3,"00:42:32,174","00:42:34,934",2.76,631,Why not go see him up close?
1,3,"00:42:36,011","00:42:37,141",1.13,632,We were doing it in secret.
1,3,"00:42:37,721","00:42:41,351",3.63,633,"Mu-deok seemed to feel uneasy about approaching him,"
1,3,"00:42:41,433","00:42:42,563",1.13,634,so I stayed with her.
1,3,"00:42:45,729","00:42:49,149",3.42,635,"Mu-deok, you must have feelings for Yul."
1,3,"00:42:49,233","00:42:51,243",2.01,636,-No-- -Dang-gu.
1,3,"00:42:51,318","00:42:53,198",1.88,637,You caught on very quickly.
1,3,"00:42:53,279","00:42:55,109",1.83,638,This is making me blush.
1,3,"00:42:55,197","00:42:58,617",3.42,639,-Young Master! This is a misunderstanding. -Do not be shy.
1,3,"00:42:58,701","00:43:01,621",2.92,640,Many women have fallen for Yul.
1,3,"00:43:01,704","00:43:03,374",1.67,641,-It is natural you feel that way. -It is not…
1,3,"00:43:03,455","00:43:05,575",2.12,642,I will help Mu-deok.
1,3,"00:43:05,666","00:43:07,246",1.58,643,"Uk, go to the reception room."
1,3,"00:43:07,334","00:43:08,544",1.21,644,Why?
1,3,"00:43:09,128","00:43:10,168",1.04,645,Master Heo wants to see you.
1,3,"00:43:10,254","00:43:11,264",1.01,646,Master Heo?
1,3,"00:43:34,653","00:43:36,913",2.26,647,Goodness.
1,3,"00:43:39,408","00:43:41,118",1.71,648,I heard you asked for me.
1,3,"00:43:43,245","00:43:44,245",1.00,649,Yes.
1,3,"00:43:44,872","00:43:47,372",2.50,650,The sound of your cough is nice and clear.
1,3,"00:43:47,458","00:43:49,208",1.75,651,I guess you are feeling much better.
1,3,"00:43:49,293","00:43:51,673",2.38,652,I still feel dizzy and nauseous.
1,3,"00:43:52,338","00:43:53,878",1.54,653,I also keep fainting.
1,3,"00:43:54,506","00:43:57,006",2.50,654,But I am getting better thanks to you.
1,3,"00:43:57,092","00:43:59,182",2.09,655,I saw you and your maid
1,3,"00:43:59,261","00:44:03,101",3.84,656,energetically walking around this morning.
1,3,"00:44:03,182","00:44:04,682",1.50,657,How strange is that?
1,3,"00:44:05,893","00:44:07,813",1.92,658,"Hey, come stand here."
1,3,"00:44:08,687","00:44:10,307",1.62,659,I need to take something from you.
1,3,"00:44:12,316","00:44:13,146",0.83,660,"Before you do,"
1,3,"00:44:13,859","00:44:15,779",1.92,661,I brought something for you.
1,3,"00:44:17,613","00:44:18,573",0.96,662,For me?
1,3,"00:44:19,239","00:44:20,989",1.75,663,"Back when I was a child,"
1,3,"00:44:21,075","00:44:23,325",2.25,664,"I let loose a bunch of goats in your medicinal herb garden,"
1,3,"00:44:23,410","00:44:25,160",1.75,665,and I know you have hated me since.
1,3,"00:44:25,245","00:44:28,915",3.67,666,Those goats ate all the medicinal herbs
1,3,"00:44:28,999","00:44:30,919",1.92,667,and are still living to this day.
1,3,"00:44:31,001","00:44:33,301",2.30,668,"Even so, you still saved my life"
1,3,"00:44:33,379","00:44:36,299",2.92,669,and kept me alive. I am extremely grateful for that.
1,3,"00:44:36,382","00:44:38,552",2.17,670,"I thought you were a complete lout,"
1,3,"00:44:38,634","00:44:41,724",3.09,671,but I guess you have learned how to express your gratitude.
1,3,"00:44:41,804","00:44:43,854",2.05,672,I have prepared something for you.
1,3,"00:44:44,431","00:44:45,471",1.04,673,Maidservant Kim.
1,3,"00:45:07,663","00:45:11,253",3.59,674,This wine was made with spring water from a volcanic island in Southern Daeho.
1,3,"00:45:11,333","00:45:14,553",3.22,675,"It is dark wine, the best wine you can find in Daeho."
1,3,"00:45:16,130","00:45:18,340",2.21,676,"Young Master Jang said he wanted to thank you,"
1,3,"00:45:18,424","00:45:21,894",3.47,677,so I went through great lengths to acquire it.
1,3,"00:45:26,598","00:45:28,178",1.58,678,This is a rare delicacy.
1,3,"00:45:32,563","00:45:34,403",1.84,679,But do I only get one bottle?
1,3,"00:45:48,579","00:45:52,289",3.71,680,You are a man who knows how to express your gratitude!
1,3,"00:45:53,625","00:45:56,875",3.25,681,"Maidservant Kim, you raised him well."
1,3,"00:45:56,962","00:45:58,422",1.46,682,-You really did. -Thank you.
1,3,"00:45:58,964","00:46:00,424",1.46,683,Bring it here. Come on.
1,3,"00:46:01,133","00:46:02,553",1.42,684,My goodness gracious.
1,3,"00:46:06,221","00:46:08,271",2.05,685,Three bottles?
1,3,"00:46:13,687","00:46:14,767",1.08,686,Mother.
1,3,"00:46:15,481","00:46:17,731",2.25,687,Uk's gate of energy has opened.
1,3,"00:46:18,567","00:46:22,947",4.38,688,"We could not do anything until now because of the Gwanju's orders,"
1,3,"00:46:24,072","00:46:27,662",3.59,689,but does this mean we can accept him into the family now?
1,3,"00:46:27,743","00:46:31,333",3.59,690,That boy called off the engagement after he used you.
1,3,"00:46:32,247","00:46:33,667",1.42,691,Yet you still like him?
1,3,"00:46:33,749","00:46:36,629",2.88,692,I was the one who used him to my advantage.
1,3,"00:46:37,127","00:46:39,587",2.46,693,"His gate of energy was closed, so I used it against him"
1,3,"00:46:39,671","00:46:41,381",1.71,694,to try and make him live with us.
1,3,"00:46:41,465","00:46:43,045",1.58,695,Do not distort the truth.
1,3,"00:46:43,133","00:46:46,513",3.38,696,He offered to come live with us if we helped him open his gate.
1,3,"00:46:46,595","00:46:47,925",1.33,697,That is how he seduced you.
1,3,"00:46:51,225","00:46:53,055",1.83,698,It ended up happening anyway.
1,3,"00:46:53,143","00:46:56,273",3.13,699,"If you had opened his gate of energy back then,"
1,3,"00:46:56,355","00:46:58,435",2.08,700,"you would have gotten a son-in-law,"
1,3,"00:46:58,524","00:47:02,654",4.13,701,and I would have married the man I wanted to marry.
1,3,"00:47:04,988","00:47:06,108",1.12,702,Cho-yeon.
1,3,"00:47:06,990","00:47:09,490",2.50,703,The son of the Jang family whose gate of energy is now open
1,3,"00:47:09,576","00:47:11,746",2.17,704,will never become my son-in-law.
1,3,"00:47:13,121","00:47:15,871",2.75,705,You will have to take your sister's place
1,3,"00:47:16,667","00:47:19,707",3.04,706,and become the leader that guards Jinyowon for the family.
1,3,"00:47:21,380","00:47:23,720",2.34,707,Find a man who will support your cause.
1,3,"00:47:25,384","00:47:27,144",1.76,708,"If my sister had not died,"
1,3,"00:47:27,928","00:47:30,098",2.17,709,I would have gotten married to the man I loved.
1,3,"00:47:37,104","00:47:38,904",1.80,710,"I apologize, Mother."
1,3,"00:47:40,691","00:47:44,191",3.50,711,Go and see if Gwigu's pottery is back in one piece again.
1,3,"00:47:45,487","00:47:46,697",1.21,712,All right.
1,3,"00:48:33,619","00:48:37,789",4.17,713,Uk even broke this precious Gwigu.
1,3,"00:48:42,628","00:48:44,798",2.17,714,What if I ask him to marry me in return?
1,3,"00:48:45,756","00:48:47,166",1.41,715,I bet he will refuse.
1,3,"00:48:53,096","00:48:56,886",3.79,716,So Yul sleeps in the room that is at the very far end?
1,3,"00:48:56,975","00:49:00,185",3.21,717,Yes. He enjoys peace and quiet.
1,3,"00:49:01,897","00:49:03,397",1.50,718,What time does he go to bed?
1,3,"00:49:03,899","00:49:05,359",1.46,719,"If he is not busy,"
1,3,"00:49:05,442","00:49:08,652",3.21,720,he normally sleeps early and wakes up early too.
1,3,"00:49:10,030","00:49:11,070",1.04,721,Why do you ask?
1,3,"00:49:11,156","00:49:13,026",1.87,722,So you can visit him during his sleep?
1,3,"00:49:14,409","00:49:16,499",2.09,723,"No matter how much you like him, that is wrong."
1,3,"00:49:19,539","00:49:20,789",1.25,724,Here is a tip.
1,3,"00:49:20,874","00:49:23,794",2.92,725,"He always eats at the same hour, so go see him in the dining hall."
1,3,"00:49:25,003","00:49:26,253",1.25,726,All right.
1,3,"00:49:26,338","00:49:29,628",3.29,727,I need to do more than just see him. I need to touch him.
1,3,"00:49:47,275","00:49:48,855",1.58,728,"Mu-deok, are you all right?"
1,3,"00:49:52,906","00:49:54,066",1.16,729,"Hey, Yul."
1,3,"00:49:57,202","00:49:59,752",2.55,730,Outsiders are not allowed to read the books in Jeongjingak.
1,3,"00:50:00,539","00:50:02,919",2.38,731,She is only here to help.
1,3,"00:50:02,999","00:50:04,879",1.88,732,"Besides, they are all about magic spells."
1,3,"00:50:04,960","00:50:06,840",1.88,733,She would not understand anyway.
1,3,"00:50:08,714","00:50:09,974",1.26,734,You are quite nimble.
1,3,"00:50:11,299","00:50:12,879",1.58,735,Do you know martial arts?
1,3,"00:50:15,887","00:50:18,637",2.75,736,I learned how to dance at the brothel.
1,3,"00:50:21,810","00:50:23,440",1.63,737,That is why I am nimble.
1,3,"00:50:27,774","00:50:30,904",3.13,738,Where is Dong-i? I need to ask for something.
1,3,"00:50:33,488","00:50:36,368",2.88,739,"Well, Dong-i is not here but Mu-deok is."
1,3,"00:50:36,992","00:50:39,372",2.38,740,"Mu-deok, come and help him out."
1,3,"00:50:39,453","00:50:40,753",1.30,741,I will help you.
1,3,"00:50:40,829","00:50:42,829",2.00,742,"No, that is not necessary."
1,3,"00:50:59,139","00:51:01,219",2.08,743,"Shall I clean up, Young Master?"
1,3,"00:51:05,061","00:51:07,941",2.88,744,"Young Master, are you going to eat? What would you like to eat?"
1,3,"00:51:09,608","00:51:12,188",2.58,745,Young Master! I will…
1,3,"00:51:24,748","00:51:28,338",3.59,746,This is where the Jeongjingak mages live. Do not follow me any longer.
1,3,"00:51:33,757","00:51:37,137",3.38,747,I heard he sleeps early. I wonder if he is going to bed already.
1,3,"00:51:50,774","00:51:52,114",1.34,748,Is this the bathhouse?
1,3,"00:52:00,492","00:52:02,742",2.25,749,I told you to leave. Why do you keep following me?
1,3,"00:52:05,455","00:52:09,875",4.42,750,I still figured there might be something I could do.
1,3,"00:52:10,919","00:52:11,749",0.83,751,Is there
1,3,"00:52:13,171","00:52:14,801",1.63,752,something you want from me?
1,3,"00:52:19,886","00:52:22,506",2.62,753,I need to touch it. Now is the chance.
1,3,"00:52:23,390","00:52:26,140",2.75,754,What made you follow me all the way to the men's bathhouse?
1,3,"00:53:00,135","00:53:03,345",3.21,755,This is my chance. Six breaths and I will know how he breathes.
1,3,"00:53:06,224","00:53:07,184",0.96,756,One.
1,3,"00:53:08,310","00:53:09,140",0.83,757,Two.
1,3,"00:53:12,022","00:53:13,192",1.17,758,Three.
1,3,"00:53:13,899","00:53:15,029",1.13,759,Four.
1,3,"00:53:31,207","00:53:32,247",1.04,760,What was that for?
1,3,"00:53:32,834","00:53:35,004",2.17,761,I was so close to figuring it out.
1,3,"00:53:35,086","00:53:37,166",2.08,762,I know you also stared at me from afar with Uk.
1,3,"00:53:37,255","00:53:38,715",1.46,763,Why did you follow me?
1,3,"00:53:40,091","00:53:42,551",2.46,764,I just need him to take one more breath.
1,3,"00:53:43,595","00:53:44,465",0.87,765,Give me an answer.
1,3,"00:53:45,221","00:53:46,721",1.50,766,I am in love with you!
1,3,"00:54:12,624","00:54:13,634",1.01,767,Are you all right?
1,3,"00:54:14,709","00:54:15,999",1.29,768,It hurts.
1,3,"00:54:32,143","00:54:35,813",3.67,769,You must be after my breathing technique. You keep reaching for my core of energy.
1,3,"00:54:36,564","00:54:38,404",1.84,770,But I am in love with you.
1,3,"00:54:38,483","00:54:39,943",1.46,771,You are such an adept liar.
1,3,"00:54:40,819","00:54:42,819",2.00,772,I bet that move earlier was martial arts too.
1,3,"00:54:43,405","00:54:45,025",1.62,773,"I lived a harsh life,"
1,3,"00:54:45,115","00:54:47,525",2.41,774,so I learned a few moves just to keep myself safe.
1,3,"00:54:47,617","00:54:49,197",1.58,775,Are you doing this for Uk?
1,3,"00:54:51,496","00:54:54,416",2.92,776,I guess he is trying to control the torrent of energy inside him.
1,3,"00:54:54,499","00:54:57,419",2.92,777,But Uk will not succeed even with my breathing technique.
1,3,"00:55:00,839","00:55:03,129",2.29,778,Stop wasting your time. Just get treated and leave.
1,3,"00:55:23,069","00:55:24,989",1.92,779,"So you remember me,"
1,3,"00:55:25,989","00:55:27,119",1.13,780,Yul.
1,3,"00:56:53,368","00:56:57,118",3.75,781,I did not ignore you because I hated you.
1,3,"00:56:57,205","00:57:00,745",3.54,782,"Your mother, Do-hwa, was like a daughter to me."
1,3,"00:57:01,334","00:57:03,674",2.34,783,I am pretty much your grandfather.
1,3,"00:57:05,964","00:57:07,344",1.38,784,You little lout.
1,3,"00:57:09,759","00:57:11,639",1.88,785,"Right, Grandfather."
1,3,"00:57:14,848","00:57:19,018",4.17,786,"Your mother, Do-hwa, was extremely kind-hearted."
1,3,"00:57:20,770","00:57:22,060",1.29,787,Was she?
1,3,"00:57:22,730","00:57:26,230",3.50,788,"Yes, she was! You need to know that."
1,3,"00:57:26,317","00:57:29,447",3.13,789,Always remember that and ignore what everyone else says.
1,3,"00:57:32,949","00:57:34,199",1.25,790,That poor kid…
1,3,"00:57:37,287","00:57:41,167",3.88,791,The length and depth of how much air he inhales and exhales.
1,3,"00:57:53,303","00:57:55,353",2.05,792,That is hard to play. I am impressed.
1,3,"00:57:56,848","00:57:58,768",1.92,793,I know how to do many things.
1,3,"00:58:00,435","00:58:01,685",1.25,794,I would like it back.
1,3,"00:58:07,150","00:58:09,190",2.04,795,It looks very old.
1,3,"00:58:09,277","00:58:11,737",2.46,796,Why do you have something so old?
1,3,"00:58:15,575","00:58:17,235",1.66,797,It belongs to an old friend.
1,3,"00:58:23,374","00:58:26,214",2.84,798,"Seeing that you have it instead of your friend,"
1,3,"00:58:27,170","00:58:29,050",1.88,799,I am guessing that friend is gone.
1,3,"00:58:33,384","00:58:34,554",1.17,800,Yes.
1,3,"00:58:35,386","00:58:36,886",1.50,801,It belonged to that friend.
1,3,"00:58:39,807","00:58:41,727",1.92,802,"It means a lot to me, so give it back."
1,3,"00:58:43,311","00:58:47,321",4.01,803,"Then in return for giving it back, teach me your breathing technique."
1,3,"00:58:49,901","00:58:52,401",2.50,804,You said it was going to be useless anyway.
1,3,"00:58:52,487","00:58:54,697",2.21,805,"To me, this is just as useless."
1,3,"00:58:55,490","00:58:56,620",1.13,806,So let us trade.
1,3,"00:59:00,078","00:59:01,868",1.79,807,"This means nothing to me,"
1,3,"00:59:02,830","00:59:04,370",1.54,808,so I could even break it.
1,3,"00:59:21,766","00:59:23,266",1.50,809,Only three breaths.
1,3,"01:00:04,434","01:00:06,484",2.05,810,Where is she?
1,3,"01:00:32,920","01:00:35,170",2.25,811,What is that look on your face?
1,3,"01:00:35,715","01:00:38,045",2.33,812,That is no ordinary look.
1,3,"01:00:40,595","01:00:41,755",1.16,813,I like him.
1,3,"01:00:46,476","01:00:48,056",1.58,814,You set it up that way.
1,3,"01:00:48,895","01:00:52,315",3.42,815,I followed Yul around saying I liked him and finally found out.
1,3,"01:00:52,398","01:00:53,608",1.21,816,I see.
1,3,"01:00:54,442","01:00:57,452",3.01,817,"You are a sensitive person who kills everyone who gets near,"
1,3,"01:00:57,528","01:01:00,778",3.25,818,but you decided to fancy a guy just so you could help your pupil.
1,3,"01:01:01,824","01:01:03,034",1.21,819,What about you?
1,3,"01:01:03,117","01:01:05,787",2.67,820,I hope you did not let Heo Yeom retrieve his torrent of energy.
1,3,"01:01:05,870","01:01:08,210",2.34,821,It is safe inside me. I found out his breathing technique too.
1,3,"01:01:08,289","01:01:09,749",1.46,822,So you wasted your time.
1,3,"01:01:09,832","01:01:12,382",2.55,823,You found out? Do not lie to me.
1,3,"01:01:13,002","01:01:14,302",1.30,824,I bet you are bluffing
1,3,"01:01:14,379","01:01:16,549",2.17,825,just to act like you did something important.
1,3,"01:01:16,631","01:01:18,681",2.05,826,"I breathed the way he did,"
1,3,"01:01:18,758","01:01:21,048",2.29,827,and I think I feel something moving inside me.
1,3,"01:01:29,227","01:01:30,937",1.71,828,The energy is surging inside you.
1,3,"01:01:32,355","01:01:33,685",1.33,829,It worked.
1,3,"01:01:36,442","01:01:38,152",1.71,830,Were you this close with Yul?
1,3,"01:01:39,779","01:01:41,859",2.08,831,Be careful. I can still see the mark in your eyes.
1,3,"01:01:43,116","01:01:44,866",1.75,832,I kept using the eye drops.
1,3,"01:01:45,827","01:01:48,497",2.67,833,I didn't see the mark in the mirror. Do you still see it?
1,3,"01:01:48,579","01:01:50,119",1.54,834,I can see if I look this close.
1,3,"01:01:50,206","01:01:52,166",1.96,835,"If you really like him, this is how close you will get."
1,3,"01:01:52,250","01:01:54,040",1.79,836,So be careful who you fall for.
1,3,"01:01:55,795","01:01:57,085",1.29,837,Only I get to come this close.
1,3,"01:01:59,757","01:02:02,337",2.58,838,Fine. I will only allow it to you.
1,3,"01:02:04,303","01:02:06,143",1.84,839,I will try not to fall for Yul.
1,3,"01:02:07,849","01:02:08,889",1.04,840,What?
1,3,"01:02:08,975","01:02:11,055",2.08,841,Why does that require effort?
1,3,"01:02:11,769","01:02:13,269",1.50,842,He is handsome.
1,3,"01:02:13,354","01:02:16,194",2.84,843,It takes effort not to fall for a handsome man.
1,3,"01:02:16,274","01:02:17,484",1.21,844,What about me?
1,3,"01:02:17,567","01:02:20,737",3.17,845,I guess you have been trying hard not to fall for me as well.
1,3,"01:02:20,820","01:02:21,950",1.13,846,Not at all.
1,3,"01:02:22,947","01:02:24,817",1.87,847,Why not? It makes no sense.
1,3,"01:02:24,907","01:02:27,447",2.54,848,"-Just tell me it has been hard. -Yes, Young Master."
1,3,"01:02:27,535","01:02:29,285",1.75,849,-Say it like you mean it. -Yes.
1,3,"01:02:29,370","01:02:31,210",1.84,850,-Will you keep this up? -Yes.
1,3,"01:02:31,289","01:02:32,709",1.42,851,Come on. Humor me.
1,3,"01:04:07,552","01:04:08,722",1.17,852,Your Royal Highness.
1,3,"01:04:09,637","01:04:11,887",2.25,853,"Judging by the energy on your sword,"
1,3,"01:04:11,973","01:04:14,733",2.76,854,"you have reached the highest stage of the second step, Ryusu."
1,3,"01:04:17,687","01:04:19,307",1.62,855,"It is all thanks to your guidance,"
1,3,"01:04:20,398","01:04:21,898",1.50,856,Assistant Gwanju.
1,3,"01:04:21,983","01:04:24,653",2.67,857,The only person who is on a similar level as you
1,3,"01:04:24,735","01:04:26,985",2.25,858,is probably Seo Yul from the Seo family.
1,3,"01:04:27,822","01:04:31,492",3.67,859,"Her Majesty the Queen and Yul's father, General Seo, are siblings."
1,3,"01:04:31,576","01:04:33,696",2.12,860,"Yul and I were close as kids,"
1,3,"01:04:33,786","01:04:35,706",1.92,861,but things changed after he joined Songrim.
1,3,"01:04:38,124","01:04:41,964",3.84,862,"Seo Yul, Park Dang-gu, Jang Uk, and Jin Cho-yeon are known"
1,3,"01:04:42,044","01:04:43,804",1.76,863,to some people as Four Seasons.
1,3,"01:04:44,881","01:04:46,421",1.54,864,Let them have their fun.
1,3,"01:04:47,133","01:04:48,053",0.92,865,But wait.
1,3,"01:04:48,134","01:04:50,854",2.72,866,Why is Jang Uk part of the group when he cannot cast spells?
1,3,"01:04:51,804","01:04:53,394",1.59,867,He can now.
1,3,"01:04:54,098","01:04:55,518",1.42,868,His gate of energy has opened.
1,3,"01:04:56,309","01:04:57,979",1.67,869,His gate of energy has opened?
1,3,"01:05:01,272","01:05:03,272",2.00,870,But there is not much he can do.
1,3,"01:05:03,357","01:05:05,777",2.42,871,"He is the son of Jang Gang, Cheonbugwan's Gwanju."
1,3,"01:05:07,278","01:05:08,358",1.08,872,"Recently,"
1,3,"01:05:08,446","01:05:11,156",2.71,873,he came and asked me for Naksu's sword.
1,3,"01:05:13,326","01:05:14,156",0.83,874,And?
1,3,"01:05:17,204","01:05:19,214",2.01,875,Are you afraid I will do it?
1,3,"01:05:19,290","01:05:20,580",1.29,876,So did you give it to him?
1,3,"01:05:20,666","01:05:23,126",2.46,877,His Majesty ordered you to keep it inside Cheonbugwan.
1,3,"01:05:23,210","01:05:26,630",3.42,878,"The Gwanju position belongs to a member of the Jang family,"
1,3,"01:05:27,298","01:05:28,548",1.25,879,so I had no choice.
1,3,"01:05:30,885","01:05:32,505",1.62,880,How rude of him.
1,3,"01:05:32,595","01:05:34,465",1.87,881,He was probably looking down on me.
1,3,"01:05:35,306","01:05:37,556",2.25,882,"After all, I was his father's pupil."
1,3,"01:05:37,642","01:05:41,022",3.38,883,"If you think about it, I was not even an official pupil."
1,3,"01:05:42,271","01:05:45,151",2.88,884,"I had nowhere to go after I got kicked out by the Jin family,"
1,3,"01:05:46,067","01:05:48,067",2.00,885,and he took me in as his servant.
1,3,"01:05:48,861","01:05:51,201",2.34,886,You are the teacher of this country's crown prince.
1,3,"01:05:51,280","01:05:53,030",1.75,887,How dare he look down on you.
1,3,"01:05:53,115","01:05:54,985",1.87,888,That is the same thing as insulting me.
1,3,"01:05:55,076","01:05:57,196",2.12,889,I just want to apologize that
1,3,"01:05:58,162","01:06:01,292",3.13,890,your teacher is someone who comes from a low status.
1,3,"01:06:06,045","01:06:07,295",1.25,891,"One of these days,"
1,3,"01:06:08,172","01:06:10,512",2.34,892,I must crush that Jang Uk.
1,3,"01:06:31,153","01:06:33,703",2.55,893,"That sword belongs to Gwanju Jang, Jang Uk's father."
1,3,"01:06:35,199","01:06:36,279",1.08,894,I once…
1,3,"01:06:37,368","01:06:39,748",2.38,895,promised to take him in if he successfully unsheathed
1,3,"01:06:40,496","01:06:42,116",1.62,896,his father's sword.
1,3,"01:06:42,206","01:06:44,786",2.58,897,"Now that his gate of energy is open, it will be possible."
1,3,"01:06:45,376","01:06:48,546",3.17,898,Are you going to let Uk become a mage of Songrim?
1,3,"01:06:50,965","01:06:53,625",2.66,899,Go bring Uk.
1,3,"01:07:02,977","01:07:06,227",3.25,900,What did you say? The father of this child is whom?
1,3,"01:07:07,023","01:07:08,443",1.42,901,The late king.
1,3,"01:07:09,817","01:07:11,687",1.87,902,He is the king's son!
1,3,"01:07:14,030","01:07:15,660",1.63,903,Are you saying he is the son
1,3,"01:07:16,574","01:07:19,204",2.63,904,of His Majesty who died last year?
1,3,"01:07:19,785","01:07:21,115",1.33,905,The late king
1,3,"01:07:21,787","01:07:24,617",2.83,906,passed due to a severe illness and could not even move.
1,3,"01:07:24,707","01:07:25,877",1.17,907,So how is that possible?
1,3,"01:07:25,958","01:07:27,538",1.58,908,"The day this child was born,"
1,3,"01:07:28,502","01:07:31,132",2.63,909,a star that symbolizes the king was found in the night sky.
1,3,"01:07:32,757","01:07:35,627",2.87,910,"The late king's brother had already taken over the throne,"
1,3,"01:07:36,343","01:07:38,473",2.13,911,and he even has a son to succeed him.
1,3,"01:07:38,554","01:07:41,684",3.13,912,"If the royal family finds out that this child was destined to be king,"
1,3,"01:07:42,558","01:07:44,388",1.83,913,they will see it
1,3,"01:07:45,519","01:07:46,809",1.29,914,as treason.
1,3,"01:07:51,942","01:07:54,402",2.46,915,His existence will bring chaos.
1,3,"01:07:55,404","01:07:58,034",2.63,916,He should not attract attention or challenge anyone.
1,3,"01:08:00,034","01:08:02,544",2.51,917,We must make people think that he is nothing special.
1,3,"01:08:08,292","01:08:10,002",1.71,918,I sincerely apologize
1,3,"01:08:10,669","01:08:13,259",2.59,919,for all the trouble and chaos I have caused.
1,3,"01:08:15,841","01:08:17,891",2.05,920,Songrim decided
1,3,"01:08:18,552","01:08:20,302",1.75,921,"to open your gate of energy,"
1,3,"01:08:21,013","01:08:22,683",1.67,922,so you will not be held responsible.
1,3,"01:08:24,225","01:08:26,185",1.96,923,"I, Jang Uk, the eldest of the Jang family,"
1,3,"01:08:26,268","01:08:28,058",1.79,924,am now ready to practice and learn.
1,3,"01:08:28,896","01:08:31,266",2.37,925,"If Songrim gives me a chance, I will do my very best."
1,3,"01:08:32,525","01:08:34,645",2.12,926,"And to show my loyalty,"
1,3,"01:08:34,735","01:08:37,565",2.83,927,"I will pass on Naksu's sword, a sword I took from Jin Mu,"
1,3,"01:08:38,405","01:08:40,155",1.75,928,and keep it in Songrim's Sword Room.
1,3,"01:08:42,910","01:08:44,290",1.38,929,I refuse the offer.
1,3,"01:08:47,706","01:08:52,456",4.75,930,"That sword was meant for the Jang family, so your family can keep it safe."
1,3,"01:08:59,218","01:09:02,428",3.21,931,You may take your father's sword as well.
1,3,"01:09:03,889","01:09:07,979",4.09,932,"From this moment forward, I hereby banish Jang Uk from Songrim."
1,3,"01:09:14,024","01:09:15,614",1.59,933,I allowed you to freely enter
1,3,"01:09:16,152","01:09:18,742",2.59,934,as you were the son of an old friend.
1,3,"01:09:19,780","01:09:24,700",4.92,935,But you have no right to enter Songrim as a mage.
1,3,"01:09:26,078","01:09:27,748",1.67,936,"From now on,"
1,3,"01:09:27,830","01:09:31,630",3.80,937,Jang Uk will not be given access to anything in Songrim.
1,3,"01:09:34,670","01:09:38,880",4.21,938,Hand in the Spirit Plaque that allows you to enter this place.
1,3,"01:09:43,971","01:09:45,221",1.25,939,I do not have it.
1,3,"01:09:46,015","01:09:46,845",0.83,940,What?
1,3,"01:09:48,809","01:09:50,139",1.33,941,I lost it.
1,3,"01:09:52,855","01:09:54,015",1.16,942,I lost the Spirit Plaque.
1,3,"01:09:54,106","01:09:56,606",2.50,943,What kind of punishment is given
1,3,"01:09:57,568","01:09:59,278",1.71,944,to those who lose the Spirit Plaque?
1,3,"01:10:00,529","01:10:02,529",2.00,945,"A hundred floggings, my lord."
1,3,"01:10:02,615","01:10:05,195",2.58,946,Then I hereby order a hundred floggings for Jang Uk
1,3,"01:10:05,284","01:10:07,334",2.05,947,for having lost the Spirit Plaque.
1,3,"01:10:43,864","01:10:46,334",2.47,948,"He has Master Heo's torrent of energy, so he will be all right."
1,3,"01:10:46,909","01:10:49,749",2.84,949,"If you get involved, it will only make it worse for him."
1,3,"01:11:34,290","01:11:36,380",2.09,950,"Jang Uk, leave Songrim"
1,3,"01:11:36,458","01:11:38,458",2.00,951,and do not ever come back again.
