"1","7","1","00:00:46:05","00:00:49:09","Daeho once suffered
from a long and unusual drought."
"1","7","2","00:00:52:06","00:00:54:18","It was so bad that it even caused
Lake Gyeongcheondaeho"
"1","7","3","00:00:54:20","00:00:56:14","to completely dry up."
"1","7","4","00:01:03:22","00:01:07:14","The mages of Daeho performed a grand rite"
"1","7","5","00:01:07:16","00:01:09:09","to fill the lake back up with energy."
"1","7","6","00:01:15:06","00:01:18:15","Then enormous hailstones
started falling from the sky."
"1","7","7","00:01:30:01","00:01:31:16","But among the many hailstones,"
"1","7","8","00:01:31:18","00:01:34:15","there was one that did not melt."
"1","7","9","00:01:36:18","00:01:41:14","This unmelting hailstone
first turned into fire,"
"1","7","10","00:01:42:05","00:01:43:12","then stone,"
"1","7","11","00:01:44:00","00:01:45:20","and then water."
"1","7","12","00:01:46:19","00:01:50:06","Then it turned back
into its original form, ice."
"1","7","13","00:01:51:02","00:01:53:19","In that process, it produced black powder."
"1","7","14","00:01:55:17","00:01:59:12","This powder was called the Soul Ejector,
which was used in the alchemy of souls."
"1","7","15","00:02:03:02","00:02:06:01","The power of the Soul Ejector
was truly astonishing."
"1","7","16","00:02:07:22","00:02:11:19","One could bring the dead back to life
by summoning back their souls."
"1","7","17","00:02:12:09","00:02:15:07","One could shift souls
from one body to another."
"1","7","18","00:02:17:04","00:02:19:06","One could even expel
the soul of the living"
"1","7","19","00:02:19:08","00:02:21:21","and steal their energy."
"1","7","20","00:02:28:05","00:02:33:00","Eventually, that boundless power
ended up causing chaos."
"1","7","21","00:02:41:24","00:02:46:02","In order to possess the unmelting ice
that produced the Soul Ejector,"
"1","7","22","00:02:46:21","00:02:51:19","the battle of mages turned into bloodshed,
and Daeho became a living hell."
"1","7","23","00:03:00:23","00:03:03:15","The man who ended the long-lasting battle"
"1","7","24","00:03:05:07","00:03:09:07","was Master Seo Gyeong,
the founder of Songrim."
"1","7","25","00:03:19:01","00:03:20:21","I was his pupil."
"1","7","26","00:03:20:23","00:03:23:15","That ice stone sounds amazing."
"1","7","27","00:03:23:17","00:03:26:16","Where is it? I would like to see it."
"1","7","28","00:03:26:18","00:03:29:07","It is an extremely frightening stone."
"1","7","29","00:03:29:09","00:03:31:02","Sorcery using the stone's power"
"1","7","30","00:03:31:04","00:03:34:19","created wicked things
that could hurt people."
"1","7","31","00:03:35:15","00:03:38:13","Boy, where did you get that wooden doll?"
"1","7","32","00:03:38:15","00:03:40:12","I found it up in the mountain."
"1","7","33","00:03:44:07","00:03:46:09","Would you like to trade it for this?"
"1","7","34","00:03:46:24","00:03:47:23","Yes."
"1","7","35","00:03:56:13","00:03:59:03","This is a relic cursed with sorcery."
"1","7","36","00:04:08:06","00:04:09:14","-What was that?
-What was that?"
"1","7","37","00:04:09:16","00:04:12:17","That was a dangerous item
created with sorcery."
"1","7","38","00:04:12:19","00:04:15:01","I know what they are.
They are called relics."
"1","7","39","00:04:16:06","00:04:17:11","Jinyowon has lots of them."
"1","7","40","00:04:19:04","00:04:20:09","That is right."
"1","7","41","00:04:20:11","00:04:23:07","Inside Jinyowon, there are relics
that are much more dangerous."
"1","7","42","00:04:24:15","00:04:26:24","There, you will find many peculiar items"
"1","7","43","00:04:27:01","00:04:29:08","that were made
with the power of the ice stone."
"1","7","44","00:04:36:04","00:04:40:17","They sit there waiting for an opportunity
to come out into the world again."
"1","7","45","00:04:54:06","00:04:55:20","Should I take you in?"
"1","7","46","00:04:56:15","00:04:57:18","No, thank you."
"1","7","47","00:04:58:24","00:05:01:16","I may be a filthy girl
whom everyone avoids,"
"1","7","48","00:05:02:07","00:05:05:03","but I refuse to serve just anyone."
"1","7","49","00:05:05:05","00:05:07:09","Damn it. How dare she."
"1","7","50","00:05:08:07","00:05:09:22","She should have been grateful."
"1","7","51","00:05:09:24","00:05:13:14","This batch of cinnamon and ginger wine
has quite a strong scent of cinnamon."
"1","7","52","00:05:14:10","00:05:15:23","Thank you, Your Royal Highness."
"1","7","53","00:05:18:24","00:05:20:15","It smells of cinnamon."
"1","7","54","00:05:24:08","00:05:25:13","That impudent girl."
"1","7","55","00:05:25:15","00:05:27:02","Is there something bothering you?"
"1","7","56","00:05:27:05","00:05:29:22","The filth from Filthy Mu-deok
must have gotten on me."
"1","7","57","00:05:30:12","00:05:32:09","The stench will not go away."
"1","7","58","00:05:33:10","00:05:34:22","It smells wonderful."
"1","7","59","00:05:38:10","00:05:39:21","Forget it. Get out."
"1","7","60","00:05:40:22","00:05:41:21","Leave already."
"1","7","61","00:05:41:23","00:05:43:10","Yes, Your Royal Highness."
"1","7","62","00:05:50:21","00:05:53:21","I showed her mercy
and saved her from trouble."
"1","7","63","00:05:53:23","00:05:56:00","I even gave her my sachet
and a silk dress."
"1","7","64","00:06:04:18","00:06:06:01","How ungrateful of her."
"1","7","65","00:06:11:00","00:06:13:18","-I am grateful.
-I told you to leave…"
"1","7","66","00:06:20:09","00:06:21:18","Filthy Mu-deok?"
"1","7","67","00:06:21:20","00:06:23:07","How did you get in here?"
"1","7","68","00:06:24:11","00:06:27:07","I have that sachet you gave me."
"1","7","69","00:06:28:23","00:06:32:06","You must be here
because you need something from me again."
"1","7","70","00:06:32:08","00:06:34:23","You have been thinking about me,
Your Royal Highness,"
"1","7","71","00:06:35:00","00:06:36:02","so I came to see you."
"1","7","72","00:06:36:04","00:06:38:07","Are you saying you can read my mind?"
"1","7","73","00:06:41:20","00:06:42:21","Good."
"1","7","74","00:06:44:05","00:06:48:12","Have a glass of cinnamon and ginger wine
that is a lot stronger than the last one."
"1","7","75","00:06:57:10","00:06:59:13","It smells wonderful."
"1","7","76","00:07:01:09","00:07:02:10","It does?"
"1","7","77","00:07:06:17","00:07:10:11","I must say, I really like this place."
"1","7","78","00:07:12:07","00:07:15:17","I hope you continue to think of me
just like you did today."
"1","7","79","00:07:16:06","00:07:18:03","I will come to visit whenever you do."
"1","7","80","00:07:30:04","00:07:32:05","The palace is a great place."
"1","7","81","00:07:35:24","00:07:37:17","You get to dress in silk,"
"1","7","82","00:07:39:12","00:07:42:04","and it is filled with different kinds
of aromatic wine."
"1","7","83","00:07:44:00","00:07:46:11","But do you know
why I keep thinking of you?"
"1","7","84","00:07:50:11","00:07:52:03","Because you are Filthy Mu-deok."
"1","7","85","00:07:55:04","00:07:57:06","But right now, you do not reek of filth."
"1","7","86","00:07:58:19","00:08:00:17","Your Royal Highness."
"1","7","87","00:08:00:19","00:08:01:16","Who are you?"
"1","7","88","00:08:11:08","00:08:12:21","You caught me."
"1","7","89","00:08:26:14","00:08:28:05","Something wicked just came in here."
"1","7","90","00:08:28:07","00:08:29:18","-Search around.
-Yes, Your Royal Highness."
"1","7","91","00:08:34:21","00:08:36:16","Why did it show up looking like Mu-deok?"
"1","7","92","00:08:44:16","00:08:46:01","Search every corner again."
"1","7","93","00:08:46:03","00:08:47:11","-Yes, my lady.
-Yes, my lady."
"1","7","94","00:08:51:13","00:08:53:06","The Crown Prince is here."
"1","7","95","00:08:54:00","00:08:55:07","The Crown Prince?"
"1","7","96","00:09:02:06","00:09:03:24","I am in search of someone."
"1","7","97","00:09:04:01","00:09:05:20","I was told that she would be here."
"1","7","98","00:09:07:10","00:09:10:11","Is there something going on?
There seems to be a disturbance."
"1","7","99","00:09:11:01","00:09:14:07","A maid caused trouble and disappeared,
so we were looking for her."
"1","7","100","00:09:14:09","00:09:15:09","A maid?"
"1","7","101","00:09:15:11","00:09:17:05","She does not work for us."
"1","7","102","00:09:17:07","00:09:19:11","Her name is Mu-deok.
She serves the Jang family."
"1","7","103","00:09:19:13","00:09:21:04","She is whom I am looking for."
"1","7","104","00:09:22:04","00:09:23:18","Did something happen?"
"1","7","105","00:09:25:12","00:09:26:12","That maid…"
"1","7","106","00:09:27:23","00:09:30:22","accidentally broke the yin-and-yang jade
that was going to be used"
"1","7","107","00:09:31:13","00:09:32:20","to make my wedding rings."
"1","7","108","00:09:37:16","00:09:39:18","I told you to be careful."
"1","7","109","00:09:39:20","00:09:41:03","What will you do now?"
"1","7","110","00:09:41:21","00:09:43:02","I apologize, my lady."
"1","7","111","00:09:43:17","00:09:44:23","Please forgive me."
"1","7","112","00:09:45:12","00:09:47:07","I will ask her owner to come here."
"1","7","113","00:09:47:09","00:09:49:11","Take her away
and lock her up in the annex."
"1","7","114","00:09:52:15","00:09:53:14","I am sorry!"
"1","7","115","00:09:54:10","00:09:55:11","Forgive me, my lady!"
"1","7","116","00:09:55:13","00:09:57:19","She must have been scared
about getting punished."
"1","7","117","00:09:57:21","00:10:01:01","While she was locked up,
she stole the jade and ran away."
"1","7","118","00:10:05:04","00:10:07:08","Seeing as we still have not found her,"
"1","7","119","00:10:07:11","00:10:10:07","it looks as if she has
already fled this place."
"1","7","120","00:10:12:03","00:10:13:18","She got scared and ran away?"
"1","7","121","00:10:14:15","00:10:16:03","A bold girl like her?"
"1","7","122","00:10:18:19","00:10:20:18","Mages from Jeongjingak are here to visit."
"1","7","123","00:10:29:04","00:10:32:04","Your Royal Highness, what brings you here?"
"1","7","124","00:10:32:06","00:10:33:20","What about you, Yul?"
"1","7","125","00:10:34:10","00:10:35:10","To look for someone."
"1","7","126","00:10:36:08","00:10:38:24","Did you also come here
looking for Mu-deok?"
"1","7","127","00:10:39:16","00:10:40:12","Yes."
"1","7","128","00:10:41:19","00:10:42:24","I am here for Mu-deok."
"1","7","129","00:10:50:24","00:10:53:04","She broke the yin-and-yang jade,"
"1","7","130","00:10:53:06","00:10:55:14","then ran away with it
to avoid getting punished."
"1","7","131","00:10:56:05","00:10:59:17","But why did you not
get the wedding rings made?"
"1","7","132","00:11:00:08","00:11:04:14","I went to Chwiseonru to lend you my hand,
but I heard you already had left."
"1","7","133","00:11:06:04","00:11:08:11","I just decided to postpone it."
"1","7","134","00:11:10:17","00:11:12:10","Yul, why are you looking for Mu-deok?"
"1","7","135","00:11:13:01","00:11:16:21","I also saw the exact same illusion as you,
Your Royal Highness."
"1","7","136","00:11:36:17","00:11:38:07","How did you enter Songrim?"
"1","7","137","00:11:40:23","00:11:43:12","I came because you kept longing for me."
"1","7","138","00:11:46:16","00:11:47:23","What do you mean?"
"1","7","139","00:11:49:06","00:11:51:14","You were longing for
the one you met at Danhyanggok."
"1","7","140","00:11:51:16","00:11:53:02","Stop fooling around."
"1","7","141","00:11:53:04","00:11:54:11","I was longing for you?"
"1","7","142","00:11:55:04","00:11:57:00","-I have never done that.
-You are lying."
"1","7","143","00:11:57:02","00:11:58:23","You kept the whistle."
"1","7","144","00:12:03:10","00:12:05:04","The broken leg did not bother you."
"1","7","145","00:12:06:19","00:12:08:21","And you were not scared to get scolded."
"1","7","146","00:12:11:01","00:12:12:22","Because you liked her a lot."
"1","7","147","00:12:18:18","00:12:20:19","Continue to think about her like that."
"1","7","148","00:12:28:18","00:12:30:02","Then I will come to see you."
"1","7","149","00:12:36:02","00:12:37:02","You…"
"1","7","150","00:12:37:24","00:12:38:24","are not human."
"1","7","151","00:12:50:02","00:12:51:20","Are you going to get rid of me?"
"1","7","152","00:12:53:05","00:12:55:06","Then you will never get to see me again."
"1","7","153","00:13:26:11","00:13:28:09","It was not her. It was an illusion."
"1","7","154","00:13:29:24","00:13:32:16","Does that mean
what I saw was also an illusion?"
"1","7","155","00:13:32:18","00:13:35:12","It was odd, so I went to Chwiseonru
looking for Mu-deok."
"1","7","156","00:13:36:02","00:13:37:16","They told me she was dragged here."
"1","7","157","00:13:38:13","00:13:41:02","She was not dragged here.
She was here to run an errand."
"1","7","158","00:13:41:22","00:13:44:13","And she disappeared
with something precious."
"1","7","159","00:13:45:09","00:13:48:02","We are in search of a thief,
not an illusion."
"1","7","160","00:13:53:19","00:13:54:23","There is her owner."
"1","7","161","00:14:10:11","00:14:13:08","Is Master Lee not here today again?"
"1","7","162","00:14:13:21","00:14:16:03","He is a man who wanders like the wind."
"1","7","163","00:14:16:21","00:14:18:08","He left me the dog and left."
"1","7","164","00:14:19:02","00:14:22:01","Was Gwigu also made from the ice stone?"
"1","7","165","00:14:22:03","00:14:25:23","Master Seo Gyeong made this
with the energy from the ice stone"
"1","7","166","00:14:26:00","00:14:28:04","in hopes of finding traces of sorcery."
"1","7","167","00:14:29:07","00:14:31:22","Uk broke Gwigu's pottery,"
"1","7","168","00:14:31:24","00:14:34:24","so Master Lee
summoned the spirit from Jinyowon"
"1","7","169","00:14:35:17","00:14:37:08","and put it inside this dog."
"1","7","170","00:14:37:10","00:14:40:17","Do you really not know
where Master Seo Gyeong"
"1","7","171","00:14:41:22","00:14:43:03","sealed the ice stone?"
"1","7","172","00:14:45:00","00:14:45:24","I do not know."
"1","7","173","00:14:46:24","00:14:49:21","Do you think the alchemy of souls
started to occur again"
"1","7","174","00:14:49:23","00:14:52:02","because someone managed
to unseal the ice stone?"
"1","7","175","00:14:53:16","00:14:56:24","The only way for someone to shift souls
without mastering Hwansu"
"1","7","176","00:14:57:18","00:14:59:05","is by using the ice stone."
"1","7","177","00:14:59:19","00:15:02:14","I am certain that someone
unsealed the ice stone"
"1","7","178","00:15:03:05","00:15:04:19","and brought it out into the world again."
"1","7","179","00:15:06:00","00:15:08:01","Well, that is not good."
"1","7","180","00:15:08:03","00:15:12:07","We cannot let the disaster
from 200 years ago repeat itself."
"1","7","181","00:15:13:19","00:15:16:22","We must find the ice stone."
"1","7","182","00:15:26:14","00:15:29:02","I was given orders to give this to you."
"1","7","183","00:15:39:09","00:15:42:03","I thought you were
going to lie low for a while."
"1","7","184","00:15:42:05","00:15:45:15","Are you planning on
shifting another person's soul?"
"1","7","185","00:15:49:13","00:15:51:09","Tell them that I safely received this."
"1","7","186","00:15:52:11","00:15:53:12","I will."
"1","7","187","00:16:00:05","00:16:02:22","Hurry up and find a eunuch
who can replace him."
"1","7","188","00:16:05:01","00:16:08:20","Your soul will be shifted into that body,
so choose wisely."
"1","7","189","00:16:08:23","00:16:10:02","Yes, sir."
"1","7","190","00:16:11:09","00:16:13:04","I did not serve the Danju"
"1","7","191","00:16:13:06","00:16:15:06","just to shift my soul
into a eunuch's body."
"1","7","192","00:16:17:08","00:16:19:08","I will use Naksu"
"1","7","193","00:16:19:23","00:16:21:19","to get the body I want."
"1","7","194","00:16:30:22","00:16:33:04","My maid has committed a disgraceful act."
"1","7","195","00:16:33:17","00:16:35:17","I am fully responsible as her master."
"1","7","196","00:16:37:00","00:16:38:03","I apologize."
"1","7","197","00:16:41:12","00:16:45:02","You must be upset about having lost
the jade to be used for the wedding rings."
"1","7","198","00:16:46:07","00:16:48:15","I pleaded to my mother
for that yin-and-yang jade."
"1","7","199","00:16:49:18","00:16:51:14","Yin-and-yang jade wedding rings"
"1","7","200","00:16:51:16","00:16:53:21","allow couples to have
a long and happy marriage."
"1","7","201","00:16:54:20","00:16:56:04","But it is broken now."
"1","7","202","00:16:56:06","00:16:58:10","I did not know that
it held such a deep meaning."
"1","7","203","00:16:59:05","00:17:00:22","I must say, I am upset too."
"1","7","204","00:17:02:09","00:17:06:11","We will find you a more valuable jade
for the wedding rings."
"1","7","205","00:17:09:05","00:17:11:21","I appreciate your sincere apology."
"1","7","206","00:17:12:12","00:17:14:16","-You may all leave now.
-Thank you."
"1","7","207","00:17:14:18","00:17:15:16","I cannot do that."
"1","7","208","00:17:17:23","00:17:19:05","I need to find Mu-deok."
"1","7","209","00:17:22:02","00:17:24:10","I want to find that wicked maid"
"1","7","210","00:17:24:22","00:17:27:03","and have her return the yin-and-yang jade."
"1","7","211","00:17:27:24","00:17:31:18","She is weak and she has short legs,
so she will not have traveled far."
"1","7","212","00:17:33:00","00:17:36:08","I would like your permission to stay
and look for her myself."
"1","7","213","00:17:40:24","00:17:42:07","You have my permission."
"1","7","214","00:17:43:05","00:17:44:06","Thank you."
"1","7","215","00:17:44:23","00:17:48:06","Now that I have your permission,
I would like you to open the door."
"1","7","216","00:17:50:14","00:17:52:03","Open the door to Jinyowon,"
"1","7","217","00:17:53:09","00:17:54:24","where relics and artifacts reside."
"1","7","218","00:18:14:16","00:18:18:02","Jinyowon's entrance can only be opened
by a member of the Jin family."
"1","7","219","00:18:18:04","00:18:22:03","Right now, Cho-yeon and I are
the only ones who can open this door."
"1","7","220","00:18:22:23","00:18:25:01","There is no way she is in there."
"1","7","221","00:18:25:03","00:18:26:16","I saw Mu-deok's illusion."
"1","7","222","00:18:29:13","00:18:31:00","Maybe you were dreaming."
"1","7","223","00:18:31:20","00:18:34:24","How can you be sure that
it was an illusion created by a relic?"
"1","7","224","00:18:35:01","00:18:36:00","I saw it too."
"1","7","225","00:18:37:23","00:18:39:19","It was an illusion disguised as Mu-deok."
"1","7","226","00:18:41:18","00:18:45:02","All the relics that have the power
to create illusions are inside Jinyowon."
"1","7","227","00:18:45:05","00:18:46:12","Let us go inside and check."
"1","7","228","00:18:47:15","00:18:49:22","All right. I will open the door."
"1","7","229","00:18:51:11","00:18:55:06","However, this place is filled
with dangerous relics and artifacts."
"1","7","230","00:18:56:16","00:18:58:21","You could be possessed by sorcery
and be unable to return."
"1","7","231","00:19:00:06","00:19:02:16","Young Master, it is too dangerous."
"1","7","232","00:19:03:20","00:19:05:12","I will go with him."
"1","7","233","00:19:09:06","00:19:10:06","As will I."
"1","7","234","00:19:15:01","00:19:16:08","It sounds fun."
"1","7","235","00:19:16:23","00:19:19:11","When will I get a chance
to enter Jinyowon again?"
"1","7","236","00:19:43:20","00:19:45:04","Go on inside."
"1","7","237","00:19:45:06","00:19:46:20","I will give you an hour."
"1","7","238","00:20:02:03","00:20:03:23","We should tell the leader."
"1","7","239","00:20:07:24","00:20:09:02","Mu-deok."
"1","7","240","00:20:10:00","00:20:11:08","Mu-deok!"
"1","7","241","00:20:16:10","00:20:18:22","So this is Jinyowon."
"1","7","242","00:20:19:16","00:20:23:18","They say everything here is so precious.
Not a single one can be bought with money."
"1","7","243","00:20:23:21","00:20:26:05","Will you please be quiet?
We are not here on a tour."
"1","7","244","00:20:27:10","00:20:28:12","You are not the owner."
"1","7","245","00:20:29:14","00:20:32:17","But I guess that could change
if you marry into the Jin family."
"1","7","246","00:20:34:14","00:20:35:16","Lucky you."
"1","7","247","00:20:35:18","00:20:38:10","All these precious treasures
will become yours, Jin Uk."
"1","7","248","00:20:39:09","00:20:42:16","If you envy me so much,
you can marry into this family instead."
"1","7","249","00:20:43:11","00:20:47:00","But even if you do become the owner,
how will you control anything?"
"1","7","250","00:20:47:01","00:20:48:08","You are a low-level mage."
"1","7","251","00:20:48:10","00:20:50:18","If you are so great,
can you touch anything here?"
"1","7","252","00:20:51:15","00:20:54:15","The leader of Jinyowon told us
not to touch anything."
"1","7","253","00:20:54:17","00:20:57:17","What an excuse.
You are just too scared to touch them."
"1","7","254","00:21:03:18","00:21:05:01","-Damn it.
-What was that?"
"1","7","255","00:21:05:03","00:21:06:13","I do not know. What was that?"
"1","7","256","00:21:08:11","00:21:09:10","Are you all right?"
"1","7","257","00:21:10:04","00:21:11:14","Something odd must be in there."
"1","7","258","00:21:12:16","00:21:14:04","Were you not startled?"
"1","7","259","00:21:15:11","00:21:16:19","I was startled."
"1","7","260","00:21:17:23","00:21:19:19","It is dark in here, so be careful."
"1","7","261","00:21:22:21","00:21:24:08","Was he really startled?"
"1","7","262","00:21:24:10","00:21:26:21","Yes. When Yul gets startled,
he loses his sense of direction."
"1","7","263","00:21:26:23","00:21:28:04","Yul, do not go that way!"
"1","7","264","00:21:29:21","00:21:30:20","It is the other way."
"1","7","265","00:21:31:14","00:21:33:15","We must go that way."
"1","7","266","00:21:38:02","00:21:39:13","Let us all be careful."
"1","7","267","00:21:42:20","00:21:44:04","Yul is always so calm,"
"1","7","268","00:21:44:22","00:21:47:08","but he can be a scatterbrain
when he is startled too."
"1","7","269","00:21:47:23","00:21:49:00","I guess so."
"1","7","270","00:21:54:17","00:21:56:04","Just make sure to be careful."
"1","7","271","00:21:56:23","00:21:58:17","Be careful yourself."
"1","7","272","00:22:00:04","00:22:01:15","Wait for me."
"1","7","273","00:22:38:18","00:22:40:12","How did I get stuck in here?"
"1","7","274","00:22:52:05","00:22:53:17","I should have held it in."
"1","7","275","00:22:55:09","00:22:57:09","I should not have provoked her."
"1","7","276","00:22:59:08","00:23:00:21","I told you to be careful."
"1","7","277","00:23:00:24","00:23:04:00","You wait here.
Young Master Jang will be here soon."
"1","7","278","00:23:04:14","00:23:07:05","Young Lady Jin,
what is going to happen to me now?"
"1","7","279","00:23:07:07","00:23:10:09","What do you think?
You will be severely punished."
"1","7","280","00:23:11:04","00:23:13:10","No, that is not what I am worried about."
"1","7","281","00:23:13:12","00:23:16:05","They say whoever breaks
the yin-and-yang jade"
"1","7","282","00:23:16:07","00:23:19:01","will never have
a long-lasting relationship."
"1","7","283","00:23:21:02","00:23:22:23","What am I going to do now?"
"1","7","284","00:23:24:02","00:23:25:24","What do you mean?"
"1","7","285","00:23:26:01","00:23:27:10","Stop talking nonsense."
"1","7","286","00:23:28:13","00:23:30:07","If you break the yin-and-yang jade,"
"1","7","287","00:23:30:09","00:23:33:10","they say the person you love
will never love you back."
"1","7","288","00:23:34:00","00:23:36:22","I heard all the gisaengs
at Chwiseonru saying that."
"1","7","289","00:23:36:24","00:23:39:12","Is that true?"
"1","7","290","00:23:39:14","00:23:40:17","Yes."
"1","7","291","00:23:41:09","00:23:45:04","Did you not know that, Young Lady Jin?"
"1","7","292","00:23:45:19","00:23:47:08","That cannot be."
"1","7","293","00:23:49:17","00:23:51:12","Then what is going to happen to me?"
"1","7","294","00:23:55:05","00:23:56:22","Why are you worried"
"1","7","295","00:23:57:15","00:23:59:08","when I was the one who broke it?"
"1","7","296","00:24:03:20","00:24:05:19","You broke the jade, did you not?"
"1","7","297","00:24:06:17","00:24:09:19","You made me carry it
so you could blame it on me."
"1","7","298","00:24:10:16","00:24:11:15","Am I right?"
"1","7","299","00:24:12:21","00:24:16:11","If you felt so wronged, you should have
said something to my mother."
"1","7","300","00:24:17:03","00:24:19:10","Had I humiliated her daughter
in front of everyone,"
"1","7","301","00:24:20:05","00:24:22:09","she would not have forgiven me."
"1","7","302","00:24:22:24","00:24:24:06","I am not scared of you,"
"1","7","303","00:24:24:23","00:24:28:11","but I am scared of your mother,
the leader of Jinyowon."
"1","7","304","00:24:31:19","00:24:33:06","Are you that afraid of your mother?"
"1","7","305","00:24:33:21","00:24:36:19","It is true that I fear my mother,
but I hate you just as much."
"1","7","306","00:24:37:22","00:24:38:23","I will sell you."
"1","7","307","00:24:39:20","00:24:42:05","Like you said, my mother is a scary woman."
"1","7","308","00:24:42:07","00:24:45:17","You will get sold
as punishment for having broken the jade."
"1","7","309","00:24:46:06","00:24:47:12","To place far away!"
"1","7","310","00:25:28:10","00:25:30:10","Did she run away?"
"1","7","311","00:26:01:24","00:26:04:03","Should I try climbing over this wall?"
"1","7","312","00:26:42:18","00:26:44:19","How did she open the door to Jinyowon?"
"1","7","313","00:26:52:07","00:26:54:24","So this is Jinyowon."
"1","7","314","00:26:58:14","00:27:02:02","If she gets locked inside, she might die."
"1","7","315","00:27:28:23","00:27:30:01","Hey."
"1","7","316","00:27:37:09","00:27:38:20","So it is you."
"1","7","317","00:27:43:00","00:27:44:13","It has been a long time."
"1","7","318","00:28:12:00","00:28:13:04","You cannot leave."
"1","7","319","00:28:15:04","00:28:16:11","It will not break."
"1","7","320","00:28:18:06","00:28:19:15","Nothing will work!"
"1","7","321","00:28:23:20","00:28:24:24","Be quiet."
"1","7","322","00:28:35:10","00:28:38:23","Could she have died since she is
incapable of practicing spells?"
"1","7","323","00:28:40:02","00:28:41:24","If they saw her as an illusion…"
"1","7","324","00:28:46:01","00:28:47:03","Young Lady Jin."
"1","7","325","00:28:48:09","00:28:52:07","Every time you move, I hear a sound."
"1","7","326","00:28:54:04","00:28:55:08","It sounds…"
"1","7","327","00:28:55:20","00:28:58:01","like jade clinking against each other."
"1","7","328","00:29:12:06","00:29:13:02","Mu-deok!"
"1","7","329","00:29:21:13","00:29:23:16","The hour is up. We must leave."
"1","7","330","00:29:23:18","00:29:26:00","I am not going. I must find her."
"1","7","331","00:29:26:02","00:29:29:11","This place is too big and deep.
The three of us cannot find her here."
"1","7","332","00:29:29:13","00:29:32:20","You only came in here for a tour,
so you may go ahead and leave."
"1","7","333","00:29:34:17","00:29:36:11","How did you see an illusion of Mu-deok?"
"1","7","334","00:29:37:13","00:29:39:07","I do not know where it came from."
"1","7","335","00:29:39:20","00:29:41:00","But…"
"1","7","336","00:29:43:18","00:29:46:11","I came because you kept longing for me."
"1","7","337","00:29:46:13","00:29:47:15","That is right."
"1","7","338","00:29:47:17","00:29:48:21","She said that to me too."
"1","7","339","00:29:49:12","00:29:50:24","That she came because I thought of her."
"1","7","340","00:29:51:02","00:29:54:20","So her illusion comes to see you
if you think about her?"
"1","7","341","00:29:55:14","00:29:56:20","I guess you did not see it."
"1","7","342","00:29:57:12","00:29:59:02","She visited me and Yul,"
"1","7","343","00:29:59:04","00:30:01:19","but she did not visit you
even though you are her owner."
"1","7","344","00:30:01:21","00:30:04:16","Why in the world
were you thinking about Mu-deok?"
"1","7","345","00:30:08:12","00:30:10:16","I was drinking cinnamon and ginger wine."
"1","7","346","00:30:10:19","00:30:13:19","Were you the one who got her drunk
and made her reek of cinnamon?"
"1","7","347","00:30:13:21","00:30:14:20","That is correct."
"1","7","348","00:30:15:20","00:30:17:19","I also gave her a sachet that day."
"1","7","349","00:30:17:21","00:30:20:17","The smell of cinnamon
probably came from the sachet."
"1","7","350","00:30:21:17","00:30:22:23","Oh, you mean the sachet"
"1","7","351","00:30:23:18","00:30:26:10","that she hung by the outhouse
to get rid of flies?"
"1","7","352","00:30:27:01","00:30:28:12","""By the outhouse""?"
"1","7","353","00:30:28:14","00:30:31:21","Thank you, Your Royal Highness.
It really helped shoo away the flies."
"1","7","354","00:30:33:19","00:30:36:08","Yul, what were you doing
when you saw her illusion?"
"1","7","355","00:30:39:06","00:30:40:08","The mirror."
"1","7","356","00:30:41:15","00:30:44:02","-My mirror broke.
-So did the one in my room."
"1","7","357","00:30:46:23","00:30:48:18","Did it come from the mirror?"
"1","7","358","00:30:51:02","00:30:52:06","A mirror?"
"1","7","359","00:30:57:16","00:30:58:19","Could this be it?"
"1","7","360","00:31:10:00","00:31:12:04","That is not you. It is fake."
"1","7","361","00:31:12:06","00:31:13:11","It is an illusion."
"1","7","362","00:31:22:10","00:31:23:21","So it was you."
"1","7","363","00:31:29:23","00:31:31:17","She is trapped inside the mirror?"
"1","7","364","00:31:32:17","00:31:33:20","Yes."
"1","7","365","00:31:33:22","00:31:36:24","We cannot see what is inside,
but we are sure she is in there."
"1","7","366","00:31:37:16","00:31:38:21","She was sucked into the Mirror of Longing."

"1","7","368","00:31:41:08","00:31:43:18","It is a relic that creates illusions."
"1","7","369","00:31:44:09","00:31:45:17","It uses other mirrors"
"1","7","370","00:31:45:19","00:31:48:08","to show illusions of things
that people long for."
"1","7","371","00:31:49:16","00:31:52:04","She knows no spells,
so she probably got sucked inside"
"1","7","372","00:31:52:07","00:31:53:16","while she was in front of it."
"1","7","373","00:31:55:09","00:31:57:17","We need to get Mu-deok out of the mirror."
"1","7","374","00:31:57:19","00:32:01:06","Our spells will not work
because the energy in there is too strong."
"1","7","375","00:32:02:16","00:32:04:11","Please take the Mirror of Longing
out of Jinyowon."
"1","7","376","00:32:05:12","00:32:06:16","That cannot be done."
"1","7","377","00:32:08:00","00:32:09:24","That relic swallowed a human."
"1","7","378","00:32:10:01","00:32:12:00","It is too dangerous to take it outside."
"1","7","379","00:32:13:11","00:32:15:06","I order you as the Crown Prince."
"1","7","380","00:32:15:08","00:32:16:12","Take out the Mirror of Longing."
"1","7","381","00:32:18:23","00:32:22:18","The Unanimous Assembly has granted us
a plaque to protect Jinyowon"
"1","7","382","00:32:22:20","00:32:24:23","from a situation like this."
"1","7","383","00:32:27:21","00:32:31:04","I cannot take it out
even if it is the King's orders."
"1","7","384","00:32:33:24","00:32:35:12","Uk will not leave…"
"1","7","385","00:32:36:16","00:32:37:24","without Mu-deok."
"1","7","386","00:32:38:00","00:32:40:12","Then he will have to stay inside."
"1","7","387","00:32:41:08","00:32:43:17","Once the hour is over,"
"1","7","388","00:32:43:19","00:32:45:16","I am going to seal this door."
"1","7","389","00:32:48:20","00:32:49:18","Mother."
"1","7","390","00:32:50:14","00:32:52:15","I found the yin-and-yang jade."
"1","7","391","00:32:56:10","00:32:57:24","Mu-deok must not have stolen it."
"1","7","392","00:32:59:00","00:33:00:13","Now that I found the jade,"
"1","7","393","00:33:00:16","00:33:03:03","please take out the Mirror of Longing
and get Mu-deok out of there."
"1","7","394","00:33:03:05","00:33:05:23","Young Master Jang will die
if he gets locked inside."
"1","7","395","00:33:06:18","00:33:07:20","Stay out of this."
"1","7","396","00:33:09:19","00:33:12:21","Once the agreed time is over,
I shall seal the door."
"1","7","397","00:33:28:14","00:33:30:02","Do not waste your energy."
"1","7","398","00:33:30:04","00:33:32:06","You know you do not have
the power to break it."
"1","7","399","00:33:32:08","00:33:34:06","Shut it! You are nothing but an illusion."
"1","7","400","00:33:34:08","00:33:36:21","That is right. I am an illusion."
"1","7","401","00:33:38:02","00:33:39:23","An illusion that reflects who you are."
"1","7","402","00:33:44:13","00:33:47:08","Humans are incapable
of seeing themselves with their own eyes."
"1","7","403","00:33:47:10","00:33:49:19","The only way is
to see themselves through a mirror."
"1","7","404","00:33:50:23","00:33:53:11","So the perception you have about yourself"
"1","7","405","00:33:54:14","00:33:56:06","is nothing but an illusion."
"1","7","406","00:33:59:23","00:34:03:00","The same goes for how others perceive you."
"1","7","407","00:34:03:21","00:34:07:21","They only see what they want to see
and create an illusion that suits them."
"1","7","408","00:34:10:13","00:34:11:21","It is all just an illusion."
"1","7","409","00:34:12:13","00:34:13:23","If what you say is true,"
"1","7","410","00:34:15:02","00:34:17:15","that means people
only see illusions and nothing else."
"1","7","411","00:34:18:21","00:34:19:21","That is right."
"1","7","412","00:34:20:17","00:34:23:18","I turn into what they want to see the most
and show it to them."
"1","7","413","00:34:28:01","00:34:29:18","I shall do the same for you."
"1","7","414","00:34:37:03","00:34:38:17","Give me your energy."
"1","7","415","00:34:38:19","00:34:39:20","Then I will…"
"1","7","416","00:34:41:00","00:34:43:10","turn you into
the most perfect version of yourself."
"1","7","417","00:34:49:01","00:34:50:05","But…"
"1","7","418","00:34:51:17","00:34:54:18","you need my reflection
to create that so-called illusion."
"1","7","419","00:34:55:24","00:34:57:03","What?"
"1","7","420","00:34:57:17","00:34:59:12","If there is nothing to reflect,"
"1","7","421","00:35:01:09","00:35:02:23","a mirror becomes useless."
"1","7","422","00:35:23:07","00:35:25:20","You are nothing but a piece of glass."
"1","7","423","00:35:27:14","00:35:29:04","That is enough babbling from you."
"1","7","424","00:35:30:08","00:35:31:14","Mu-deok!"
"1","7","425","00:35:32:18","00:35:34:08","Are you in there?"
"1","7","426","00:35:36:00","00:35:37:03","Mu-deok!"
"1","7","427","00:35:38:17","00:35:39:22","Uk."
"1","7","428","00:35:42:16","00:35:43:16","Uk!"
"1","7","429","00:35:45:14","00:35:47:07","Uk, I am in here!"
"1","7","430","00:35:49:13","00:35:50:19","I found you."
"1","7","431","00:35:58:04","00:35:59:20","The time is up."
"1","7","432","00:36:00:12","00:36:02:16","Cho-yeon, seal that door."
"1","7","433","00:36:02:18","00:36:03:20","Mother."
"1","7","434","00:36:04:20","00:36:07:10","-Do it now.
-Please wait."
"1","7","435","00:36:19:07","00:36:20:22","I would like to go inside."
"1","7","436","00:36:22:08","00:36:24:07","If the relic cannot be brought outside,"
"1","7","437","00:36:24:09","00:36:28:19","I will go in there myself
and get her out of the Mirror of Longing."
"1","7","438","00:36:28:21","00:36:31:23","How can I trust a high-level mage
to set foot in there?"
"1","7","439","00:36:32:00","00:36:33:08","Trust me."
"1","7","440","00:36:34:02","00:36:36:17","I will not touch any other artifacts."
"1","7","441","00:36:36:19","00:36:38:03","I am not sure if I can."
"1","7","442","00:36:38:05","00:36:41:13","My trust was once broken
by a Songrim mage."
"1","7","443","00:36:43:16","00:36:47:01","Have you ever allowed
a Songrim mage to enter Jinyowon?"
"1","7","444","00:36:49:24","00:36:51:17","If you want to save Jang Uk,"
"1","7","445","00:36:51:19","00:36:55:13","you will have to ask mages
from Jeongjingak to drag him out of there."
"1","7","446","00:36:59:17","00:37:00:18","My lord."
"1","7","447","00:37:00:21","00:37:02:00","We are running out of time."
"1","7","448","00:37:05:13","00:37:07:23","Yul, I want you to go in there"
"1","7","449","00:37:08:17","00:37:10:06","and bring Uk out."
"1","7","450","00:37:15:20","00:37:16:23","Mu-deok."
"1","7","451","00:37:18:00","00:37:19:08","While you were gone,"
"1","7","452","00:37:20:15","00:37:22:06","I thought about…"
"1","7","453","00:37:23:23","00:37:25:05","what I could do"
"1","7","454","00:37:26:14","00:37:28:16","to keep you by my side."
"1","7","455","00:37:31:23","00:37:33:20","If I become Cheonbugwan's Gwanju,"
"1","7","456","00:37:35:18","00:37:37:10","you can be the Assistant Gwanju."
"1","7","457","00:37:38:08","00:37:40:00","Why would I want that?"
"1","7","458","00:37:40:02","00:37:42:19","You said you did not want
to stay by my side as just a maid."
"1","7","459","00:37:42:21","00:37:45:17","We cannot tell anyone
that you are my master."
"1","7","460","00:37:45:19","00:37:48:07","But you can stay
if you become the Assistant Gwanju."
"1","7","461","00:37:48:09","00:37:51:13","Cheonbugwan's Gwanju
keeping a soul shifter by his side?"
"1","7","462","00:37:53:11","00:37:54:17","You must be mad."
"1","7","463","00:37:57:22","00:38:00:07","I thought about it
after I heard about my marriage."
"1","7","464","00:38:01:06","00:38:03:05","""He finally has a way out."""
"1","7","465","00:38:04:08","00:38:06:02","""But how will I manage without him?"""
"1","7","466","00:38:07:20","00:38:09:18","I bet you thought that and felt lost."
"1","7","467","00:38:15:17","00:38:17:08","But now that you are not here,"
"1","7","468","00:38:19:16","00:38:20:24","I feel just as lost."
"1","7","469","00:38:35:22","00:38:37:01","Mu-deok."
"1","7","470","00:38:39:03","00:38:40:11","I miss you."
"1","7","471","00:39:14:10","00:39:16:04","Feign ignorance even if I get caught."
"1","7","472","00:39:17:00","00:39:19:21","No one here will let that thing attack me."
"1","7","473","00:39:26:04","00:39:27:22","Then do me a favor, Uk."
"1","7","474","00:39:27:24","00:39:29:21","Take me up there."
"1","7","475","00:39:30:13","00:39:31:09","Fine."
"1","7","476","00:39:31:11","00:39:34:22","I will take you to the top of that tree."
"1","7","477","00:40:07:19","00:40:08:17","Mu-deok."
"1","7","478","00:40:09:04","00:40:10:04","What is happening?"
"1","7","479","00:40:12:12","00:40:13:16","She is here!"
"1","7","480","00:40:13:18","00:40:14:23","Who?"
"1","7","481","00:40:15:13","00:40:17:12","It is her, the blind girl!"
"1","7","482","00:40:18:08","00:40:19:17","It is the ice stone!"
"1","7","483","00:40:24:00","00:40:25:12","The mirror is going to shatter."
"1","7","484","00:40:26:05","00:40:27:03","Step away."
"1","7","485","00:41:30:21","00:41:31:22","Young Master."
"1","7","486","00:41:32:10","00:41:33:16","Mu-deok."
"1","7","487","00:41:33:18","00:41:36:02","-Are you all right?
-Yes, I am fine."
"1","7","488","00:41:36:04","00:41:38:02","-Is Mu-deok all right as well?
-Of course."
"1","7","489","00:42:07:07","00:42:09:22","I fell while bringing out
the yin-and-yang jade."
"1","7","490","00:42:11:00","00:42:13:08","I think that was when the jade broke."
"1","7","491","00:42:14:16","00:42:17:12","So you tried to blame a maid
for the already-broken jade."
"1","7","492","00:42:19:08","00:42:20:14","And the Mirror of Longing?"
"1","7","493","00:42:21:19","00:42:23:17","It was next to me when I fell,"
"1","7","494","00:42:23:19","00:42:25:12","but I did not even touch it."
"1","7","495","00:42:26:03","00:42:29:04","Uk is not strong enough
to break the Mirror of Longing."
"1","7","496","00:42:30:02","00:42:31:13","Then I must have"
"1","7","497","00:42:31:15","00:42:34:20","harmed the mirror as I fell."
"1","7","498","00:42:38:23","00:42:40:06","Did you also"
"1","7","499","00:42:41:01","00:42:43:24","lock Mu-deok inside Jinyowon?"
"1","7","500","00:42:44:01","00:42:47:17","I did seal the door,
but she walked inside herself."
"1","7","501","00:42:47:19","00:42:51:13","Those who are not members
of the Jin family cannot open that door."
"1","7","502","00:42:53:04","00:42:54:17","Are you saying Mu-deok opened it?"
"1","7","503","00:42:56:19","00:42:58:05","Then I must have"
"1","7","504","00:42:59:03","00:43:00:19","opened the door."
"1","7","505","00:43:01:14","00:43:04:11","I just saw her go inside
and locked her in there out of anger."
"1","7","506","00:43:07:03","00:43:08:04","I apologize."
"1","7","507","00:43:09:17","00:43:11:02","I will tell everyone"
"1","7","508","00:43:12:16","00:43:15:14","to keep things quiet."
"1","7","509","00:43:18:03","00:43:21:03","I shall also stay silent about this
to help you save face."
"1","7","510","00:43:22:09","00:43:24:03","I am truly sorry."
"1","7","511","00:43:28:01","00:43:29:08","Are you all right?"
"1","7","512","00:43:30:01","00:43:31:09","Can you still not see?"
"1","7","513","00:43:33:05","00:43:34:03","No."
"1","7","514","00:43:34:18","00:43:36:24","I saw a really bright light
when the mirror broke."
"1","7","515","00:43:37:15","00:43:39:03","I cannot seem to open my eyes."
"1","7","516","00:43:42:11","00:43:44:09","We should cover your eyes then."
"1","7","517","00:43:48:00","00:43:49:03","Here."
"1","7","518","00:43:53:13","00:43:57:08","If you stare at the sun for too long,
you are not able to see for a while."
"1","7","519","00:43:58:02","00:43:59:07","You will recover soon."
"1","7","520","00:44:01:01","00:44:02:13","I am sorry for this."
"1","7","521","00:44:03:03","00:44:04:15","You did nothing wrong."
"1","7","522","00:44:05:09","00:44:06:24","Young Lady Jin is at fault."
"1","7","523","00:44:17:16","00:44:19:12","Mu-deok, are you all right?"
"1","7","524","00:44:20:08","00:44:22:19","What are you doing here,
Young Master Park?"
"1","7","525","00:44:24:14","00:44:25:24","I came because I was worried."
"1","7","526","00:44:26:15","00:44:28:00","I see you have hurt your eyes."
"1","7","527","00:44:28:14","00:44:30:05","Young Master Seo, you came as well?"
"1","7","528","00:44:34:17","00:44:37:21","You should get treated at Sejukwon.
I will take you there right now."
"1","7","529","00:44:37:23","00:44:39:20","The palace is near, so she can go there."
"1","7","530","00:44:40:08","00:44:42:15","Your Royal Highness? You are here too?"
"1","7","531","00:44:48:02","00:44:49:21","I will take you to the royal clinic."
"1","7","532","00:44:50:11","00:44:51:21","That is not necessary."
"1","7","533","00:44:51:23","00:44:55:04","She was just blinded by the light.
She did not get hurt."
"1","7","534","00:44:56:05","00:44:59:08","I know you did not plan any of this,
but they came here for you."
"1","7","535","00:44:59:11","00:45:02:03","So you should apologize and thank them."
"1","7","536","00:45:05:05","00:45:06:16","I apologize for troubling you."
"1","7","537","00:45:07:08","00:45:08:20","Thank you all."
"1","7","538","00:45:21:07","00:45:22:10","Young Master."
"1","7","539","00:45:24:00","00:45:25:01","Let us go home."
"1","7","540","00:45:49:06","00:45:51:05","After what happened today,"
"1","7","541","00:45:52:10","00:45:55:05","I do not know
if their marriage will proceed."
"1","7","542","00:45:55:07","00:45:56:16","Did you hear what she said?"
"1","7","543","00:45:57:12","00:46:00:12","She was ready to seal the door
even though Young Master was inside."
"1","7","544","00:46:01:03","00:46:02:06","How terrifying."
"1","7","545","00:46:02:08","00:46:05:08","It makes me uneasy that he will live
with a mother-in-law like her."
"1","7","546","00:46:05:10","00:46:07:12","She made that choice to protect Jinyowon."
"1","7","547","00:46:08:06","00:46:10:06","When you have a lot to protect,"
"1","7","548","00:46:10:08","00:46:13:12","you sometimes have no choice
but to be heartless."
"1","7","549","00:46:14:03","00:46:15:07","Then…"
"1","7","550","00:46:16:07","00:46:17:23","would you have done the same?"
"1","7","551","00:46:19:08","00:46:22:05","I would say you and I are pretty close."
"1","7","552","00:46:22:08","00:46:25:18","What if I got locked inside?
Would you seal the door?"
"1","7","553","00:46:26:15","00:46:27:13","So heartlessly?"
"1","7","554","00:46:32:04","00:46:33:07","My goodness."
"1","7","555","00:46:34:04","00:46:35:09","It seems like you would."
"1","7","556","00:46:36:18","00:46:38:22","Even if it means I might die in there?"
"1","7","557","00:46:38:24","00:46:41:10","Do not put me in a difficult spot
over something"
"1","7","558","00:46:42:15","00:46:44:06","that has not even happened."
"1","7","559","00:46:44:08","00:46:46:04","I am not even actually locked inside."
"1","7","560","00:46:46:23","00:46:49:07","Does it hurt for you to lie and tell me"
"1","7","561","00:46:49:09","00:46:51:14","-that you will never seal the door?
-I cannot"
"1","7","562","00:46:52:02","00:46:55:16","lie to you."
"1","7","563","00:46:57:15","00:46:58:19","Right."
"1","7","564","00:46:59:20","00:47:01:21","That is what someone like you must do."
"1","7","565","00:47:06:09","00:47:08:11","You should say hello to Young Master Jang."
"1","7","566","00:47:09:02","00:47:12:22","No. I have nothing to say to him."
"1","7","567","00:47:14:03","00:47:16:07","I cannot lie
and act like everything is fine."
"1","7","568","00:47:17:02","00:47:20:04","Of course. Thank you for today."
"1","7","569","00:47:20:18","00:47:21:14","Goodbye."
"1","7","570","00:47:31:02","00:47:32:08","Maidservant Kim…"
"1","7","571","00:47:34:18","00:47:36:07","If I ever have to seal the door,"
"1","7","572","00:47:37:20","00:47:39:11","it would shatter my heart…"
"1","7","573","00:47:42:03","00:47:43:13","to pieces."
"1","7","574","00:47:51:03","00:47:53:23","He is inflexible and slow-witted."
"1","7","575","00:47:56:04","00:47:58:19","""How could I seal the door
if you are inside?"""
"1","7","576","00:48:00:06","00:48:02:09","Could you not have said that?"
"1","7","577","00:48:17:17","00:48:18:23","What you did was dangerous."
"1","7","578","00:48:20:17","00:48:22:10","Entering Jinyowon"
"1","7","579","00:48:22:13","00:48:25:02","was recklessly childish
and stubborn of you."
"1","7","580","00:48:25:04","00:48:26:19","Do not be so angry."
"1","7","581","00:48:28:09","00:48:30:09","You may think I am pathetic,"
"1","7","582","00:48:31:11","00:48:32:14","but that is an illusion."
"1","7","583","00:48:34:15","00:48:35:11","What?"
"1","7","584","00:48:35:13","00:48:37:17","The mirror I saw inside Jinyowon told me"
"1","7","585","00:48:38:07","00:48:40:04","that people only see"
"1","7","586","00:48:40:06","00:48:42:12","what they wish to see."
"1","7","587","00:48:43:11","00:48:44:12","That it is an illusion."
"1","7","588","00:48:44:14","00:48:46:18","Are you saying I see you as an illusion?"
"1","7","589","00:48:46:21","00:48:47:23","If not,"
"1","7","590","00:48:49:03","00:48:51:04","why do you not want me to do anything?"
"1","7","591","00:48:54:13","00:48:56:06","All my life, I tried so hard"
"1","7","592","00:48:57:06","00:48:59:16","to prove to everyone
that I was my father's son."
"1","7","593","00:48:59:18","00:49:00:17","But…"
"1","7","594","00:49:01:24","00:49:03:05","you told me I was not."
"1","7","595","00:49:03:07","00:49:05:06","Though it hurt, it got rid of my illusion."
"1","7","596","00:49:05:24","00:49:07:12","But even after that,"
"1","7","597","00:49:07:14","00:49:09:18","why do you want me to stay as an illusion?"
"1","7","598","00:49:09:20","00:49:11:08","I do not care what you stay as."
"1","7","599","00:49:12:16","00:49:14:08","I only wish for one thing."
"1","7","600","00:49:15:10","00:49:16:19","And that is for you…"
"1","7","601","00:49:18:07","00:49:19:20","to be safe."
"1","7","602","00:49:24:04","00:49:27:15","The illusion I tried so hard to prove
no longer exists."
"1","7","603","00:49:29:23","00:49:31:08","So from now on,"
"1","7","604","00:49:32:21","00:49:34:08","I am going to try even harder"
"1","7","605","00:49:35:20","00:49:37:04","to find out who I really am"
"1","7","606","00:49:38:18","00:49:40:05","and what I must do from now on."
"1","7","607","00:50:11:14","00:50:12:22","Can you see now?"
"1","7","608","00:50:13:19","00:50:15:19","Yes, I can see."
"1","7","609","00:50:20:15","00:50:21:13","What?"
"1","7","610","00:50:21:15","00:50:23:22","I was told the mirror made illusions."
"1","7","611","00:50:23:24","00:50:26:20","I am checking
if it is really you that I saved."
"1","7","612","00:50:28:04","00:50:30:15","You did not save me.
I broke it and got out myself."
"1","7","613","00:50:31:12","00:50:32:07","What?"
"1","7","614","00:50:32:10","00:50:34:04","When I was trapped inside the mirror,"
"1","7","615","00:50:34:20","00:50:37:02","I regained my power for a bit
just like how I did"
"1","7","616","00:50:37:03","00:50:38:22","in Lake Gyeongcheondaeho."
"1","7","617","00:50:39:22","00:50:42:05","I am sure I broke the mirror
with my own power."
"1","7","618","00:50:42:07","00:50:43:21","So that was how you got out?"
"1","7","619","00:50:43:23","00:50:46:00","I was excited thinking it was me."
"1","7","620","00:50:46:03","00:50:47:05","Not even close."
"1","7","621","00:50:47:07","00:50:49:23","You should be grateful
that the mirror did not suck you in."
"1","7","622","00:50:50:00","00:50:53:00","I even thought about that
because you were still inside."
"1","7","623","00:50:53:02","00:50:54:15","What a futile idea."
"1","7","624","00:50:55:03","00:50:57:01","It would not have traded you for me."
"1","7","625","00:50:57:03","00:50:59:11","What if it did?
Then would it not have been futile?"
"1","7","626","00:50:59:13","00:51:00:23","Well, I would have survived."
"1","7","627","00:51:01:00","00:51:02:08","And I would have died."
"1","7","628","00:51:04:02","00:51:07:02","Listen to me, my pupil.
When there is no other way,"
"1","7","629","00:51:07:04","00:51:10:09","the best deal is
to sacrifice yourself and save me."
"1","7","630","00:51:10:12","00:51:11:20","No way."
"1","7","631","00:51:13:06","00:51:14:16","If I die, you should die too."
"1","7","632","00:51:14:18","00:51:16:10","You cannot live on your own."
"1","7","633","00:51:18:01","00:51:19:18","You have no other choice."
"1","7","634","00:51:19:20","00:51:23:00","When you put your pupil in danger,
your life should be at risk too."
"1","7","635","00:51:23:23","00:51:26:00","Fine. I will keep that in mind."
"1","7","636","00:51:26:22","00:51:28:20","Then what will happen
to marrying the woman"
"1","7","637","00:51:28:22","00:51:31:15","who almost had your master killed?"
"1","7","638","00:51:32:16","00:51:36:03","Marrying her will
surely guarantee my safety."
"1","7","639","00:51:38:20","00:51:40:19","But you almost lost your life,"
"1","7","640","00:51:41:09","00:51:43:04","so I should risk my life too."
"1","7","641","00:51:49:16","00:51:51:14","This is a marriage of convenience."
"1","7","642","00:51:52:04","00:51:55:06","So let us resolve our issues
after the wedding."
"1","7","643","00:51:55:08","00:51:57:21","The reason you need
a son-in-law like me is that"
"1","7","644","00:51:58:16","00:52:00:06","I am the eldest of the Jang family"
"1","7","645","00:52:00:09","00:52:02:09","and the next potential Gwanju
of Cheonbugwan."
"1","7","646","00:52:03:06","00:52:05:09","Our families will come together
and become stronger."
"1","7","647","00:52:06:08","00:52:09:09","Yes. Because this is
a marriage of convenience,"
"1","7","648","00:52:10:04","00:52:12:15","we should be open
about our strengths and weaknesses."
"1","7","649","00:52:13:10","00:52:15:23","Apparently, I am not the son
of Cheonbugwan's Gwanju, Jang Gang."
"1","7","650","00:52:18:20","00:52:20:20","I do not care about such rumors."
"1","7","651","00:52:23:06","00:52:25:02","But what if that rumor"
"1","7","652","00:52:26:07","00:52:27:08","turns out to be true?"
"1","7","653","00:52:30:06","00:52:32:04","Think about whether or not you are willing"
"1","7","654","00:52:32:23","00:52:35:20","to take that risk
and take me in as your son-in-law."
"1","7","655","00:52:48:00","00:52:50:13","I see you still have
the binding bracelet on you."
"1","7","656","00:52:53:11","00:52:54:14","Yes."
"1","7","657","00:52:57:13","00:52:59:16","He is still impudent as ever."
"1","7","658","00:53:08:22","00:53:12:18","Why did you decide to marry Cho-yeon off
without even discussing it with me?"
"1","7","659","00:53:13:21","00:53:17:05","Who are you to meddle
in our family matters?"
"1","7","660","00:53:17:07","00:53:18:11","Ho-gyeong."
"1","7","661","00:53:20:09","00:53:22:01","I am also a member of the Jin family."
"1","7","662","00:53:23:20","00:53:28:11","The surname ""Jin"" is only given to those
with mothers from the Jin family."
"1","7","663","00:53:29:17","00:53:33:10","My mother was a fool to have given
our family surname to someone"
"1","7","664","00:53:34:02","00:53:36:06","who my father begot out of wedlock."
"1","7","665","00:53:36:24","00:53:39:22","You kicked me out as soon as you became
the leader of Jinyowon."
"1","7","666","00:53:41:03","00:53:43:12","Do you still resent me that much?"
"1","7","667","00:53:43:14","00:53:44:17","I do not resent you."
"1","7","668","00:53:45:21","00:53:47:09","I detest you."
"1","7","669","00:53:50:08","00:53:53:01","I detest how treacherous you are."
"1","7","670","00:53:56:23","00:54:00:02","The leader of Jinyowon should not
make decisions based on preference."
"1","7","671","00:54:01:10","00:54:03:22","Choosing Jang Uk was the wrong decision."
"1","7","672","00:54:03:24","00:54:05:10","Cancel the marriage."
"1","7","673","00:54:05:12","00:54:06:17","What?"
"1","7","674","00:54:07:10","00:54:11:06","I will give you
a better card than Jang Uk."
"1","7","675","00:54:11:24","00:54:13:09","How about the Crown Prince"
"1","7","676","00:54:14:05","00:54:15:20","as your son-in-law?"
"1","7","677","00:54:19:19","00:54:23:02","You want the Crown Prince
to marry into our family and live with us?"
"1","7","678","00:54:23:21","00:54:25:12","Cho-yeon is the second daughter."
"1","7","679","00:54:25:14","00:54:28:03","Bu-yeon is the eldest
and will lead the family."
"1","7","680","00:54:29:00","00:54:31:05","Her future husband will
move in with the family,"
"1","7","681","00:54:31:07","00:54:32:22","so it is unnecessary for Cho-yeon."
"1","7","682","00:54:34:10","00:54:38:15","What are you scheming?
How dare you talk about Bu-yeon."
"1","7","683","00:54:43:09","00:54:46:22","I know that your husband is
still looking for Bu-yeon."
"1","7","684","00:54:47:13","00:54:50:05","As the Assistant Gwanju of Cheonbugwan,"
"1","7","685","00:54:50:07","00:54:53:01","I will do everything in my power
to help you find the daughter"
"1","7","686","00:54:53:20","00:54:55:04","you hopelessly long for."
"1","7","687","00:54:57:00","00:55:00:23","I will make Bu-yeon the leader of Jinyowon
and make Cho-yeon become the queen."
"1","7","688","00:55:01:00","00:55:02:00","So please"
"1","7","689","00:55:02:02","00:55:03:23","do not have her marry Uk."
"1","7","690","00:55:06:11","00:55:07:17","I, your brother,"
"1","7","691","00:55:08:11","00:55:11:23","will become Cheonbugwan's Gwanju
and give great support to Jinyowon."
"1","7","692","00:55:13:09","00:55:15:12","After all, I am a member
of the Jin family."
"1","7","693","00:55:30:17","00:55:33:16","Yul, there is something I find quite odd."
"1","7","694","00:55:34:09","00:55:36:09","Why were you thinking about Mu-deok?"
"1","7","695","00:55:37:17","00:55:39:10","I was not thinking about Mu-deok."
"1","7","696","00:55:40:14","00:55:43:10","I also do not understand
why that illusion showed up as Mu-deok"
"1","7","697","00:55:44:04","00:55:46:05","-and said those things.
-What did it say?"
"1","7","698","00:55:46:24","00:55:48:03","Hey, Yul."
"1","7","699","00:55:48:05","00:55:49:14","We have to go this way."
"1","7","700","00:55:50:05","00:55:52:24","Why do you keep wandering?
What startled you?"
"1","7","701","00:55:57:16","00:55:59:00","I will be all right."
"1","7","702","00:56:01:21","00:56:03:06","Oh, dear."
"1","7","703","00:56:06:13","00:56:07:22","Delivery packages."
"1","7","704","00:56:08:16","00:56:12:22","Young Lady Jin's marriage gifts will
probably get delivered to Songrim today."
"1","7","705","00:56:13:17","00:56:15:14","It is best that no one sees them."
"1","7","706","00:56:16:16","00:56:18:03","I should keep them safe."
"1","7","707","00:56:31:02","00:56:33:13","The bird! Catch the bird!"
"1","7","708","00:56:33:16","00:56:34:23","-Oh, gosh!
-Run!"
"1","7","709","00:56:35:15","00:56:36:24","-Darn it.
-Where did it fly to?"
"1","7","710","00:56:37:16","00:56:40:04","-Come on.
-It is over there!"
"1","7","711","00:56:41:06","00:56:42:20","-Gosh.
-Darn it."
"1","7","712","00:56:43:19","00:56:45:23","-Hey.
-Over there!"
"1","7","713","00:57:20:02","00:57:21:24","Naksu has the ability to shift souls."
"1","7","714","00:57:25:06","00:57:28:03","If Naksu shifted souls,
she is probably still alive somewhere."
"1","7","715","00:57:35:24","00:57:38:03","You were longing for
the one you met at Danhyanggok."
"1","7","716","00:57:39:21","00:57:41:17","Continue to think about her like that."
"1","7","717","00:57:43:11","00:57:44:19","Then I will come to see you."
"1","7","718","00:57:46:09","00:57:50:04","It is actually warmer than you think."
"1","7","719","00:57:51:04","00:57:54:11","The snow quickly melts in the sunny spots."
"1","7","720","00:58:01:15","00:58:02:22","So Mu-deok…"
"1","7","721","00:58:04:04","00:58:05:12","was Naksu."
"1","7","722","00:59:07:21","00:59:10:23","You were the one
who left this at Danhyanggok."
"1","7","723","00:59:16:07","00:59:18:16","So you are alive, Naksu."
"1","7","724","00:59:41:01","00:59:42:03","Mu-deok."
"1","7","725","00:59:42:18","00:59:44:10","I waited ages for you."
"1","7","726","00:59:45:00","00:59:46:15","Did Maidservant Kim not tell you?"
"1","7","727","00:59:46:17","00:59:48:06","You should have come by noon."
"1","7","728","00:59:50:03","00:59:52:23","Let us hurry. We must get
to Danhyanggok before the sun sets."
"1","7","729","00:59:53:01","00:59:54:09","Instead of Danhyanggok,"
"1","7","730","00:59:56:10","00:59:57:20","let us go somewhere else."
"1","7","731","00:59:59:00","01:00:00:02","Where?"
"1","7","732","01:00:01:03","01:00:03:18","There is an empty temple
by the bamboo forest in the east."
"1","7","733","01:00:04:05","01:00:05:10","We can go there."
"1","7","734","01:00:11:16","01:00:13:24","Bring Jang Uk here tonight."
"1","7","735","01:00:14:01","01:00:15:15","Then I shall spare your life."
"1","7","736","01:00:21:11","01:00:23:07","I must hand you over so I can live."
"1","7","737","01:00:24:01","01:00:25:07","It is what must be done."
"1","7","738","01:00:28:02","01:00:29:13","The marriage will not happen."
"1","7","739","01:00:30:13","01:00:32:13","I gave them an excuse to discard me."
"1","7","740","01:00:33:12","01:00:34:15","I see."
"1","7","741","01:00:35:09","01:00:36:10","But…"
"1","7","742","01:00:39:14","01:00:42:07","Maidservant Kim had already received
the yin-and-yang jade."
"1","7","743","01:00:42:24","01:00:44:17","So I made something out of it."
"1","7","744","01:00:52:02","01:00:53:21","-They are bird's eggs.
-Yes."
"1","7","745","01:00:54:13","01:00:55:24","Pick one. We can have one each."
"1","7","746","01:00:59:23","01:01:02:05","We have quite a peculiar relationship."
"1","7","747","01:01:02:08","01:01:05:00","A young master and a maid.
A master and a pupil."
"1","7","748","01:01:05:02","01:01:07:20","So I figured they could act
as a token to remind us"
"1","7","749","01:01:08:23","01:01:10:12","to stay loyal and dutiful."
"1","7","750","01:01:14:05","01:01:15:11","I will choose first."
"1","7","751","01:01:15:13","01:01:17:09","I pick red. You can have the blue one."
"1","7","752","01:01:21:19","01:01:25:20","Master, let us stay loyal
and dutiful to each other."
"1","7","753","01:01:32:20","01:01:34:20","-Uk.
-Yes?"
"1","7","754","01:01:37:09","01:01:38:24","This is where we say goodbye."
"1","7","755","01:01:43:09","01:01:45:08","I will return to where I came from."
"1","7","756","01:01:47:14","01:01:50:12","-But they abandoned you.
-I met them again today."
"1","7","757","01:01:51:03","01:01:52:15","They know who I am."
"1","7","758","01:01:53:11","01:01:55:05","They asked me to come back."
"1","7","759","01:01:55:07","01:01:58:03","-I thought they were dangerous.
-As you can see, I am alive."
"1","7","760","01:01:58:18","01:02:01:03","If they wanted to kill me,
they would have already."
"1","7","761","01:02:01:20","01:02:05:21","If I go back,
I will be able to regain my energy."
"1","7","762","01:02:13:14","01:02:14:23","I promised to do that for you…"
"1","7","763","01:02:15:00","01:02:17:16","I told you that
I would stand on a cliff and push you."
"1","7","764","01:02:18:21","01:02:22:02","I admit that I overtrained you every time,"
"1","7","765","01:02:24:04","01:02:25:09","and you did your best."
"1","7","766","01:02:26:17","01:02:29:03","-We can keep doing that.
-No."
"1","7","767","01:02:29:05","01:02:32:06","If we stay together, you will die,"
"1","7","768","01:02:32:24","01:02:34:14","and I will get caught."
"1","7","769","01:02:55:22","01:03:00:01","What brings the leader of Songrim
to secretly come all the way here?"
"1","7","770","01:03:00:03","01:03:01:15","I have something to ask you"
"1","7","771","01:03:02:06","01:03:06:07","about a Cheonbugwan mage
named Cho Chung from 20 years ago."
"1","7","772","01:03:11:18","01:03:13:13","Naksu's father, Cho Chung,"
"1","7","773","01:03:14:11","01:03:15:15","was a soul shifter."
"1","7","774","01:03:17:15","01:03:19:14","When we found him,"
"1","7","775","01:03:20:02","01:03:22:08","he had already run wild"
"1","7","776","01:03:22:10","01:03:26:08","and killed everyone in his family."
"1","7","777","01:03:33:07","01:03:35:10","The four families had to get involved"
"1","7","778","01:03:36:03","01:03:37:19","to stop any further killings."
"1","7","779","01:03:45:02","01:03:47:21","Naksu's father was also a soul shifter?"
"1","7","780","01:03:48:13","01:03:50:05","In the eyes of a child,"
"1","7","781","01:03:50:07","01:03:53:19","we probably seemed like murderers
for having killed her father."
"1","7","782","01:03:55:24","01:03:59:02","She must have thought
her father was murdered by us."
"1","7","783","01:03:59:21","01:04:02:11","That is probably why she came
to Songrim as an assassin."
"1","7","784","01:04:04:18","01:04:07:16","What is the important matter
that you wanted to talk about?"
"1","7","785","01:04:07:19","01:04:10:14","Do you recall anything about Naksu?"
"1","7","786","01:04:14:19","01:04:17:22","If we meet again, I will kill you."
"1","7","787","01:04:22:24","01:04:24:21","Are you implying that"
"1","7","788","01:04:24:23","01:04:28:06","I took in Cho Chung's daughter
and trained her to become an assassin?"
"1","7","789","01:04:28:08","01:04:31:15","You burned her body
as soon as it was found."
"1","7","790","01:04:31:17","01:04:34:17","Was that not because you did not want
her identity to get revealed?"
"1","7","791","01:04:36:16","01:04:40:10","I will tell you what happened 20 years ago
instead of saying what you wish to hear."
"1","7","792","01:04:44:01","01:04:45:24","Here, at Cheonbugwan, we record stars"
"1","7","793","01:04:46:01","01:04:48:07","from 1 a.m. to 3 a.m.,
when energy is the highest."
"1","7","794","01:04:49:10","01:04:52:23","The Gwanju checks it at noon,
and the recorded plate gets stored here."
"1","7","795","01:04:54:07","01:04:59:06","But one day, a constellation plate
recorded that morning disappeared."
"1","7","796","01:05:01:06","01:05:04:14","Fortunately, we were able
to find it again."
"1","7","797","01:05:07:04","01:05:09:21","What about that?"
"1","7","798","01:05:13:17","01:05:17:14","It was the day Jang Gang's wife,
Do-hwa, died and Jang Uk was born."
"1","7","799","01:05:18:18","01:05:20:19","Cho Chung recorded the stars that day,"
"1","7","800","01:05:20:21","01:05:24:10","and I was the one
who found the missing plate."
"1","7","801","01:05:38:18","01:05:41:05","I have managed to sneak out
the actual plate."
"1","7","802","01:05:41:07","01:05:44:15","The one in Cheonbugwan is
a fake one without the King's Star."
"1","7","803","01:05:50:04","01:05:51:19","Are you telling me"
"1","7","804","01:05:51:21","01:05:53:22","that you know what happened"
"1","7","805","01:05:55:00","01:05:56:24","on the day that Jang Gang's son,"
"1","7","806","01:05:58:21","01:06:00:06","Jang Uk, was born?"
"1","7","807","01:06:03:20","01:06:07:04","A star that could change the world
appeared in the sky."
"1","7","808","01:06:12:08","01:06:15:00","You knew about the King's Star?"
"1","7","809","01:06:15:02","01:06:17:24","Do you think things stayed quiet
thanks to Cho Chung's death?"
"1","7","810","01:06:19:13","01:06:22:24","Who do you think turned him
into a soul shifter in the first place?"
"1","7","811","01:06:26:00","01:06:28:19","Do not ask questions
you do not wish to hear the answers to."
"1","7","812","01:06:28:21","01:06:32:00","That is the only way
to protect Songrim and its people."
"1","7","813","01:06:44:20","01:06:48:00","The Danju does not know
that you are still alive, Naksu."
"1","7","814","01:06:49:22","01:06:51:09","I did not tell him."
"1","7","815","01:06:52:05","01:06:53:16","Bring Jang Uk."
"1","7","816","01:06:53:18","01:06:55:17","Then my lips will stay sealed."
"1","7","817","01:07:00:06","01:07:02:18","I shall shift my soul into his body."
"1","7","818","01:07:22:06","01:07:23:14","Where is Jang Uk?"
"1","7","819","01:07:24:09","01:07:25:18","He will be here soon."
"1","7","820","01:07:32:10","01:07:35:00","What brings you here at such a late hour?"
"1","7","821","01:07:38:11","01:07:39:24","Before Uk was born…"
"1","7","822","01:07:41:02","01:07:43:08","About 20 years ago…"
"1","7","823","01:07:43:10","01:07:44:18","Did Jang Gang"
"1","7","824","01:07:45:24","01:07:48:01","master a type of sorcery?"
"1","7","825","01:07:51:10","01:07:52:19","Did Jang Gang"
"1","7","826","01:07:54:06","01:07:56:02","perform the alchemy of souls?"
"1","7","827","01:08:11:14","01:08:13:01","What is taking him so long?"
"1","7","828","01:08:16:13","01:08:18:00","It is finally raining."
"1","7","829","01:08:18:24","01:08:20:06","He should be here now."
"1","7","830","01:08:24:13","01:08:25:22","Did you fool me?"
"1","7","831","01:08:28:05","01:08:30:06","Why are you stalling?"
"1","7","832","01:08:31:20","01:08:34:22","Seeing that the Danju
still has not shown up,"
"1","7","833","01:08:34:24","01:08:37:14","you really must be
the only one who knows about me."
"1","7","834","01:08:39:07","01:08:40:14","You little…"
"1","7","835","01:09:04:24","01:09:06:07","Our journey stops here."
"1","7","836","01:09:08:08","01:09:10:14","What about the empty temple by the forest?"
"1","7","837","01:09:12:05","01:09:14:21","Why were you going to take me there?"
"1","7","838","01:09:14:23","01:09:17:00","I was going to hand you over
so I could live."
"1","7","839","01:09:18:21","01:09:20:22","Now you know, so do not follow me."
"1","7","840","01:09:21:16","01:09:24:12","Then you should not have told me
about the temple."
"1","7","841","01:09:25:17","01:09:27:18","How could I not follow you"
"1","7","842","01:09:28:13","01:09:30:13","after hearing what you just said?"
"1","7","843","01:09:33:19","01:09:35:07","I am more upset than you are."
"1","7","844","01:09:35:09","01:09:37:22","I gave up my chance to live
just because of a bird's egg."
"1","7","845","01:09:38:00","01:09:40:03","I am glad I reminded you
to be loyal and dutiful."
"1","7","846","01:09:40:05","01:09:41:18","I could have actually died."
"1","7","847","01:09:45:17","01:09:47:18","Now that I have helped you escape death,"
"1","7","848","01:09:48:24","01:09:51:02","fight like your life depends on it,
my pupil."
"1","7","849","01:09:52:04","01:09:55:21","You make it sound like you saved my life."
"1","7","850","01:09:57:08","01:10:00:00","If the cloudy sky blesses us with rain,"
"1","7","851","01:10:01:17","01:10:03:18","then we both might be able to live."
"1","7","852","01:10:12:13","01:10:14:07","You really are one lucky fellow, Uk."
"1","7","853","01:10:14:20","01:10:16:14","It is raining cats and dogs."
"1","7","854","01:10:17:12","01:10:19:18","Do you not think my opponent
is a bit too strong?"
"1","7","855","01:10:20:24","01:10:22:14","He is a Cheonbugwan mage."
"1","7","856","01:10:22:16","01:10:24:06","Hi. You remember me, right?"
"1","7","857","01:12:38:06","01:12:40:17","It is time. Use Tansu."
"1","7","858","01:12:40:19","01:12:44:01","Instead of trying to flick the waterdrops
with your uncontrollable sword,"
"1","7","859","01:12:44:03","01:12:46:11","wield the sword
so that waterdrops fall onto it."
"1","7","860","01:13:44:14","01:13:45:19","No."
"1","7","861","01:13:49:12","01:13:50:19","What is that?"
"1","7","862","01:13:50:22","01:13:51:21","The alchemy of souls."
"1","7","863","01:14:43:02","01:14:45:11","Is my soul…"
"1","7","864","01:14:46:00","01:14:47:13","being shifted right now?"
