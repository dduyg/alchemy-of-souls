1,15,1,00:00:52:20,00:00:55:18,"Master. It is me, Yeom."
1,15,2,00:00:55:20,00:00:58:23,"You have been meditating
for 100 days as of yesterday."
1,15,3,00:00:59:00,00:01:00:07,It is time that you go outside.
1,15,4,00:01:05:24,00:01:07:02,Master.
1,15,5,00:01:12:17,00:01:13:23,Master.
1,15,6,00:01:17:17,00:01:18:18,Master…
1,15,7,00:01:19:21,00:01:20:19,Master.
1,15,8,00:01:22:23,00:01:23:21,Master!
1,15,9,00:01:24:17,00:01:25:19,Master…
1,15,10,00:01:27:16,00:01:28:14,Master!
1,15,11,00:01:34:13,00:01:37:14,"-Oh, dear. Poor boy.
-Poor thing."
1,15,12,00:01:37:15,00:01:40:02,"-Goodness gracious.
-Unbelievable."
1,15,13,00:01:40:04,00:01:42:20,"-He must have frozen to death.
-It seems like it."
1,15,14,00:01:42:22,00:01:45:16,"-I feel so sorry for him.
-Poor child."
1,15,15,00:01:45:18,00:01:46:23,"-Oh, gosh.
-My goodness."
1,15,16,00:01:47:00,00:01:48:17,What is going on? What is it?
1,15,17,00:01:48:19,00:01:50:23,"Oh, dear! The homeless boy has died."
1,15,18,00:01:51:00,00:01:53:15,"He was just a young boy.
I feel so bad for him."
1,15,19,00:01:53:17,00:01:56:18,"My goodness, that poor thing."
1,15,20,00:02:18:12,00:02:21:02,"Master, as you have always wished,"
1,15,21,00:02:22:08,00:02:25:08,I will give you a quiet farewell.
1,15,22,00:02:32:20,00:02:34:24,"Goodness, I feel so bad for him."
1,15,23,00:02:35:17,00:02:37:18,He seems like an orphan.
1,15,24,00:02:37:20,00:02:39:08,Let us hold a funeral for him.
1,15,25,00:02:39:10,00:02:40:14,"-Yes.
-Let us do that."
1,15,26,00:02:40:16,00:02:41:17,Should we cremate him
1,15,27,00:02:41:19,00:02:43:23,"and sprinkle the ashes
by Lake Gyeongcheondaeho?"
1,15,28,00:02:44:00,00:02:45:10,"-Oh, my goodness!
-My gosh!"
1,15,29,00:02:45:12,00:02:46:23,Child…
1,15,30,00:02:47:01,00:02:48:00,Are you all right?
1,15,31,00:02:50:15,00:02:52:12,"-What in the world…
-How…"
1,15,32,00:02:52:14,00:02:55:15,"-Where is he going?
-Where are you going?"
1,15,33,00:03:03:21,00:03:05:08,Stop!
1,15,34,00:03:16:17,00:03:17:19,Child.
1,15,35,00:03:17:21,00:03:20:05,Did you just tell me to stop?
1,15,36,00:03:22:08,00:03:23:11,How foolish of you.
1,15,37,00:03:24:03,00:03:26:15,"I cannot believe that
you have already burned my body."
1,15,38,00:03:29:04,00:03:31:04,What are you talking about?
1,15,39,00:03:33:04,00:03:36:14,"Had I been a little late,
you would have burned my cane too."
1,15,40,00:03:37:17,00:03:39:06,You fool!
1,15,41,00:03:41:24,00:03:43:03,You fool!
1,15,42,00:03:43:19,00:03:46:10,You fool!
1,15,43,00:03:47:11,00:03:49:12,You fool.
1,15,44,00:03:56:11,00:03:57:23,Master?
1,15,45,00:03:58:00,00:04:00:12,"I only temporarily
shifted my soul out of my body"
1,15,46,00:04:00:14,00:04:02:09,to test if I had reached Hwansu
1,15,47,00:04:02:11,00:04:04:20,after my 100 days of meditating.
1,15,48,00:04:05:10,00:04:09:05,"But I noticed that my body was burning,
so I quickly entered another body."
1,15,49,00:04:10:07,00:04:11:12,But it is too late.
1,15,50,00:04:14:01,00:04:17:20,"Are you saying
you are in this child's body?"
1,15,51,00:04:17:23,00:04:20:03,"Is it really you, Master?"
1,15,52,00:04:20:17,00:04:21:13,That is right.
1,15,53,00:04:21:15,00:04:24:15,"I am Lee Cheol, your master."
1,15,54,00:04:25:05,00:04:26:01,My goodness…
1,15,55,00:04:27:23,00:04:29:14,Master.
1,15,56,00:04:30:20,00:04:31:20,Master.
1,15,57,00:04:42:17,00:04:44:23,I am a soul shifter.
1,15,58,00:04:55:05,00:04:56:07,Your Majesty.
1,15,59,00:04:56:19,00:05:00:15,"Did you not summon me today
to find the soul shifter?"
1,15,60,00:05:01:06,00:05:02:12,I will do just that.
1,15,61,00:05:03:07,00:05:04:09,I can
1,15,62,00:05:04:11,00:05:06:09,recognize soul shifters.
1,15,63,00:05:40:18,00:05:42:21,"Is there anyone else
who has seen your face?"
1,15,64,00:05:47:08,00:05:48:08,This is an umbrella.
1,15,65,00:05:49:10,00:05:50:23,You can use this as a cane.
1,15,66,00:05:53:17,00:05:54:17,No.
1,15,67,00:05:54:19,00:05:58:00,"No one else in the capital knows
that I am not blind."
1,15,68,00:05:59:04,00:06:02:06,"People will think of this
as a fight between thugs."
1,15,69,00:06:10:19,00:06:12:18,You should have stopped searching for me.
1,15,70,00:06:17:15,00:06:18:14,So-i.
1,15,71,00:06:21:20,00:06:23:10,"So-i, is that you?"
1,15,72,00:06:23:12,00:06:25:01,I am Kim from Sari Village.
1,15,73,00:06:26:08,00:06:27:13,You have the wrong person.
1,15,74,00:06:35:03,00:06:37:24,"We rarely ever talked to each other.
He barely knows me."
1,15,75,00:06:38:01,00:06:39:02,That man
1,15,76,00:06:39:18,00:06:41:03,must be taken care of.
1,15,77,00:06:52:20,00:06:54:21,There was no need to kill him.
1,15,78,00:06:54:23,00:06:57:12,"Once he left for Sari Village,
we would have never met again."
1,15,79,00:06:57:14,00:06:58:16,But you did meet.
1,15,80,00:07:00:14,00:07:01:16,Sari Village?
1,15,81,00:07:04:08,00:07:05:22,Is that where you used to stay?
1,15,82,00:07:09:00,00:07:10:04,I lived there to hide.
1,15,83,00:07:11:04,00:07:14:09,"I lived there for a while
to hide from those thugs."
1,15,84,00:07:16:01,00:07:19:17,"Is there anyone else from Sari Village
who might recognize you?"
1,15,85,00:07:20:17,00:07:23:18,"I always kept a distance
so that no one would easily recognize me."
1,15,86,00:07:24:23,00:07:26:12,"I was a thief there too, you see."
1,15,87,00:07:26:14,00:07:28:06,"-What is that?
-Money."
1,15,88,00:07:28:08,00:07:31:12,"It would seem peculiar
if no one took his money after he died."
1,15,89,00:07:32:23,00:07:34:04,You can keep it.
1,15,90,00:07:48:20,00:07:51:06,"I did not want to harm anyone
from Sari Village."
1,15,91,00:08:03:19,00:08:05:13,Mu-deok is in the capital.
1,15,92,00:08:05:15,00:08:07:24,"If I ever run into her,
will I have to kill her too?"
1,15,93,00:08:10:23,00:08:13:04,Is Broker Kim from Sari Village here?
1,15,94,00:08:13:19,00:08:15:19,"Yes, he just arrived."
1,15,95,00:08:15:21,00:08:17:22,"He is in the last room
on the second floor."
1,15,96,00:08:48:24,00:08:49:24,Young Lady Jin?
1,15,97,00:08:57:15,00:09:01:17,What brings you to a place like this?
1,15,98,00:09:01:19,00:09:04:06,"It is none of your business.
You did not see me here."
1,15,99,00:09:05:11,00:09:06:21,"Young Lady Jin, by any chance…"
1,15,100,00:09:09:11,00:09:10:12,Do you gamble?
1,15,101,00:09:10:14,00:09:12:11,What? Gamble?
1,15,102,00:09:13:03,00:09:16:02,"What do you take me for?
Do I seem that vulgar to you?"
1,15,103,00:09:16:04,00:09:17:18,"No, of course not."
1,15,104,00:09:18:18,00:09:21:13,"But you lied and told me
the jade was not broken when it was."
1,15,105,00:09:21:15,00:09:25:13,"Given you are capable of lying
without feeling the least bit of guilt,"
1,15,106,00:09:26:03,00:09:28:04,"I thought you would have
a knack for gambling."
1,15,107,00:09:32:13,00:09:34:06,I came to buy tickets from a scalper.
1,15,108,00:09:35:10,00:09:37:08,The tickets to a magic show were sold out.
1,15,109,00:09:37:10,00:09:38:18,That is why I am here.
1,15,110,00:09:38:20,00:09:40:19,"ADMISSION TICKET
SEOCHUN MAGICIANS"
1,15,111,00:09:41:17,00:09:44:12,"-You got two tickets.
-I am going with my mother."
1,15,112,00:09:44:14,00:09:46:08,Do not tell anyone you saw me here.
1,15,113,00:09:46:10,00:09:48:19,"I do not wish to cause
any misunderstandings."
1,15,114,00:09:48:21,00:09:50:04,I cannot guarantee that.
1,15,115,00:09:50:06,00:09:52:19,"I am not as good of a liar
as you are, you see."
1,15,116,00:09:52:22,00:09:55:10,"So if someone asks,
I am not sure if I can lie."
1,15,117,00:09:56:19,00:09:59:16,But I will try my best for your sake.
1,15,118,00:10:04:08,00:10:06:03,Why did I have to run into her here?
1,15,119,00:10:19:08,00:10:20:24,What is the leader of Songrim doing here?
1,15,120,00:10:24:08,00:10:28:07,"I hope he is not here
to get tickets to the magic show."
1,15,121,00:10:30:10,00:10:33:06,"If he goes, I will not be able to go
with Young Master Park."
1,15,122,00:11:14:05,00:11:15:12,You must be the one
1,15,123,00:11:16:15,00:11:18:04,who killed him.
1,15,124,00:11:20:00,00:11:21:05,It was not me.
1,15,125,00:11:21:24,00:11:23:13,Why did you kill him?
1,15,126,00:11:23:14,00:11:24:24,It really was not me.
1,15,127,00:11:25:01,00:11:27:00,He was already dead when I came here.
1,15,128,00:11:32:00,00:11:33:13,He was killed not too long ago.
1,15,129,00:11:34:06,00:11:35:08,It was done in a single stroke.
1,15,130,00:11:36:14,00:11:37:23,Whoever did this is a skilled swordsman.
1,15,131,00:11:38:15,00:11:41:02,I swear it was not me.
1,15,132,00:11:41:23,00:11:43:21,I do not even have a sword.
1,15,133,00:12:04:21,00:12:06:20,"I think they were killed
by the same person."
1,15,134,00:12:08:02,00:12:09:10,Who are these men?
1,15,135,00:12:09:11,00:12:14:10,"They were a group of thugs
who recently entered the capital."
1,15,136,00:12:14:13,00:12:16:13,Did they come with Broker Kim
1,15,137,00:12:16:15,00:12:20:14,who came from Sari Village?
1,15,138,00:12:20:16,00:12:21:23,No.
1,15,139,00:12:22:00,00:12:26:14,"But I remember these thugs
picking a fight with him a few days ago."
1,15,140,00:12:28:02,00:12:32:24,"They wanted to know the whereabouts
of a female swindler from Sari Village."
1,15,141,00:12:33:01,00:12:34:15,A swindler from Sari Village?
1,15,142,00:12:34:17,00:12:36:12,Could that be Mu-deok?
1,15,143,00:12:38:12,00:12:40:18,Where is she?
1,15,144,00:12:45:11,00:12:47:03,She was right behind me.
1,15,145,00:12:49:17,00:12:50:24,She ran away.
1,15,146,00:13:01:15,00:13:02:20,What is going on?
1,15,147,00:13:03:20,00:13:05:10,What were all those bodies?
1,15,148,00:13:06:06,00:13:10:20,"They wanted to know the whereabouts
of a female swindler from Sari Village."
1,15,149,00:13:11:19,00:13:13:04,Could that really be me?
1,15,150,00:13:14:07,00:13:17:08,What kind of life has Mu-deok led?
1,15,151,00:13:17:23,00:13:20:13,Did you meet with So-i?
1,15,152,00:13:20:15,00:13:22:20,I wonder what she did this time.
1,15,153,00:13:22:22,00:13:24:16,Do not get involved with her.
1,15,154,00:13:26:21,00:13:27:22,So-i…
1,15,155,00:13:29:17,00:13:31:02,Who is So-i?
1,15,156,00:13:34:00,00:13:36:03,"I did not see the girl
who came to see you."
1,15,157,00:13:36:21,00:13:39:23,"But she quarreled with the guards
and even slapped one of them."
1,15,158,00:13:40:00,00:13:41:23,"So I am sure the guards
would remember her face."
1,15,159,00:13:42:21,00:13:46:00,"Madam, neither of those guards
came to work today."
1,15,160,00:13:46:02,00:13:48:03,"-They both did not come?
-No."
1,15,161,00:13:48:06,00:13:50:18,How strange. They never miss work.
1,15,162,00:13:56:13,00:13:59:06,"We are sorry.
How we acted was no way to treat a mage."
1,15,163,00:13:59:18,00:14:02:09,But is this really necessary?
1,15,164,00:14:02:11,00:14:03:21,"""Mage""?"
1,15,165,00:14:03:24,00:14:05:09,You even lied that you were a mage?
1,15,166,00:14:06:22,00:14:08:02,I will soon become one.
1,15,167,00:14:08:17,00:14:12:17,"One who is far more prestigious
than the likes of you."
1,15,168,00:14:15:01,00:14:18:12,"How dare you talk down to me
when you are nothing but a fake?"
1,15,169,00:14:18:24,00:14:20:24,I will continue to talk down to you
1,15,170,00:14:21:23,00:14:24:19,"while you speak to me with respect.
That is how things will be."
1,15,171,00:14:31:18,00:14:33:06,Go after him.
1,15,172,00:14:33:08,00:14:34:18,That is your job.
1,15,173,00:14:41:16,00:14:45:02,"Is there a girl named Mu-deok
from Sari Village at Chwiseonru?"
1,15,174,00:14:45:04,00:14:48:12,"Yes, I know her. Was she the person
you were looking for that night?"
1,15,175,00:14:49:11,00:14:52:16,"I had to ask her for a favor
and return something to her."
1,15,176,00:14:52:18,00:14:54:19,Mu-deok is not at Chwiseonru.
1,15,177,00:14:54:21,00:14:58:00,"She works as a maid for the Jang family,
the family of Cheonbugwan's Gwanju."
1,15,178,00:14:58:17,00:15:00:01,She is working as a maid?
1,15,179,00:15:01:08,00:15:03:07,I guess she really can see now.
1,15,180,00:15:04:04,00:15:06:07,She must have fooled you too.
1,15,181,00:15:06:09,00:15:08:00,"We brought her to Chwiseonru
thinking she was blind,"
1,15,182,00:15:08:02,00:15:10:13,"but we were shocked
when she opened her eyes and ran."
1,15,183,00:15:12:02,00:15:14:02,But she is not a swindler like I am.
1,15,184,00:15:15:06,00:15:16:18,How is she able to see?
1,15,185,00:15:20:11,00:15:22:06,Please do not kill me.
1,15,186,00:15:23:04,00:15:24:09,I am sorry.
1,15,187,00:15:24:24,00:15:27:04,"You know my face,
so I cannot let you live."
1,15,188,00:15:28:09,00:15:29:14,Please…
1,15,189,00:15:53:18,00:15:57:07,"If she was always able to see,
that means she might recognize me."
1,15,190,00:15:59:16,00:16:01:14,She works as a maid for the Jang family?
1,15,191,00:16:03:09,00:16:04:22,I should pay her a visit.
1,15,192,00:16:07:12,00:16:09:07,Mu-deok committed murder?
1,15,193,00:16:09:22,00:16:13:01,"Several men died at the ferry inn,"
1,15,194,00:16:13:03,00:16:15:20,and Mu-deok was there.
1,15,195,00:16:15:22,00:16:19:16,"But Mu-deok is not strong enough
to kill someone."
1,15,196,00:16:19:18,00:16:21:15,Especially not enough to kill several men.
1,15,197,00:16:21:17,00:16:23:22,It was done by a skilled swordsman.
1,15,198,00:16:24:12,00:16:25:22,"If it was not her,"
1,15,199,00:16:26:14,00:16:28:15,she likely received help from a mage.
1,15,200,00:16:30:02,00:16:31:07,Do not tell me
1,15,201,00:16:32:00,00:16:33:23,that you are suspecting Young Master Jang.
1,15,202,00:16:35:01,00:16:36:08,I am not.
1,15,203,00:16:36:10,00:16:39:21,"Uk is currently at the palace
with Master Lee."
1,15,204,00:16:41:19,00:16:43:09,Thank goodness.
1,15,205,00:16:43:11,00:16:45:22,It could not have been Mu-deok.
1,15,206,00:16:45:24,00:16:48:05,She has no reason to harm anyone.
1,15,207,00:16:48:07,00:16:49:11,Maidservant Kim.
1,15,208,00:16:49:13,00:16:52:23,How much do you know about Mu-deok?
1,15,209,00:16:54:12,00:16:55:20,Do you know
1,15,210,00:16:55:22,00:17:01:00,"what kind of life she led
before she started working here?"
1,15,211,00:17:03:01,00:17:03:23,What?
1,15,212,00:17:04:00,00:17:05:18,The man who died
1,15,213,00:17:05:20,00:17:08:10,"was someone I had met
to ask about Mu-deok's past."
1,15,214,00:17:10:03,00:17:12:02,"A group of thugs
who seemed to be looking for her"
1,15,215,00:17:12:24,00:17:14:15,was also killed.
1,15,216,00:17:17:12,00:17:20:06,"It was obvious that
she was bound to get suspected,"
1,15,217,00:17:20:08,00:17:22:22,"but she ran away
instead of proving her innocence."
1,15,218,00:17:23:09,00:17:24:12,One thing is for sure.
1,15,219,00:17:24:14,00:17:29:05,Mu-deok is hiding something
1,15,220,00:17:29:07,00:17:32:17,that must not be revealed.
1,15,221,00:17:42:19,00:17:45:06,The guards live over there.
1,15,222,00:17:45:08,00:17:47:04,But would it not be faster
1,15,223,00:17:47:06,00:17:50:11,"to just draw a sketch of her
and find her yourself?"
1,15,224,00:17:50:13,00:17:52:02,I do not know what she looks like.
1,15,225,00:17:52:04,00:17:55:00,"-I met her when I was blind.
-I thought you were never blind."
1,15,226,00:17:56:07,00:18:00:08,"One day, you say you were blind.
The next day, you say you were not."
1,15,227,00:18:01:13,00:18:04:11,"I do not know your reasons
but you live such a complicated life."
1,15,228,00:18:06:18,00:18:10:00,"So you do not know what she looks like,
but she knows you?"
1,15,229,00:18:10:24,00:18:13:04,"Then would it not be dangerous
to look for her?"
1,15,230,00:18:13:06,00:18:15:24,"What if she killed the broker
and those thugs?"
1,15,231,00:18:16:01,00:18:17:13,She might try to harm you too.
1,15,232,00:18:18:22,00:18:21:18,"It is more dangerous to be suspected
by the leader of Songrim."
1,15,233,00:18:24:15,00:18:27:05,"It will put you in trouble too
since you paid the broker."
1,15,234,00:18:27:07,00:18:28:14,What do you mean?
1,15,235,00:18:29:14,00:18:31:18,I do not know what you are talking about.
1,15,236,00:18:32:13,00:18:33:14,Good.
1,15,237,00:18:34:11,00:18:36:18,"Just keep acting like
you do not know anything."
1,15,238,00:18:37:17,00:18:39:08,Someone is dead!
1,15,239,00:18:58:22,00:19:01:00,Guard Lee and Guard Jang are both dead.
1,15,240,00:19:09:01,00:19:12:14,What Hwansu entails is truly impressive.
1,15,241,00:19:13:05,00:19:16:21,I thought all soul shifters were monsters.
1,15,242,00:19:17:12,00:19:19:14,"But in your case,
you gained youth and eternal life."
1,15,243,00:19:21:02,00:19:23:03,It is no wonder that
1,15,244,00:19:23:06,00:19:25:21,"everyone wanted the ice stone
for the alchemy of souls."
1,15,245,00:19:26:15,00:19:29:10,"Everyone coveted it,
which led to endless fights."
1,15,246,00:19:29:12,00:19:31:07,And that is why it was banned.
1,15,247,00:19:31:09,00:19:32:18,"All right, Master Lee."
1,15,248,00:19:33:16,00:19:35:14,You say you can recognize soul shifters.
1,15,249,00:19:35:16,00:19:37:02,Take a look around.
1,15,250,00:19:37:15,00:19:40:12,"Are there any soul shifters
in this palace?"
1,15,251,00:19:54:07,00:19:57:04,I cannot tell just by looking at them.
1,15,252,00:19:57:06,00:19:59:11,If they do not show their blue marks
1,15,253,00:19:59:13,00:20:01:11,"or run wild and get petrified,"
1,15,254,00:20:01:13,00:20:03:15,"they look no different
from ordinary humans."
1,15,255,00:20:04:13,00:20:07:08,Then how do you recognize them?
1,15,256,00:20:08:06,00:20:10:05,The fear of getting caught.
1,15,257,00:20:12:07,00:20:14:11,The horror of getting petrified.
1,15,258,00:20:18:16,00:20:20:11,I must bring that out of them.
1,15,259,00:20:21:01,00:20:23:21,So you recognize them by instilling fear?
1,15,260,00:20:23:23,00:20:25:18,I apologize if I disappointed you.
1,15,261,00:20:26:07,00:20:27:08,"Instead,"
1,15,262,00:20:28:16,00:20:30:20,"I will give you a gift, Your Majesty."
1,15,263,00:20:30:22,00:20:32:23,A gift? What have you brought?
1,15,264,00:20:34:04,00:20:35:09,A dog.
1,15,265,00:20:36:08,00:20:37:08,A dog?
1,15,266,00:20:37:10,00:20:40:01,He is a very clever and gentle dog.
1,15,267,00:20:40:03,00:20:42:09,"He should be in front
of the royal palace by now."
1,15,268,00:20:42:11,00:20:44:12,May I bring him inside?
1,15,269,00:20:44:14,00:20:46:17,"You brought him as a gift, so of course."
1,15,270,00:20:47:12,00:20:48:16,Bring him in.
1,15,271,00:20:49:14,00:20:50:11,Uk.
1,15,272,00:20:51:04,00:20:52:20,I want you to go and bring the dog.
1,15,273,00:20:54:21,00:20:58:08,"If you successfully bring him in,
I shall give you a reward."
1,15,274,00:21:28:15,00:21:31:02,"Should I just leave
and run away with Mu-deok?"
1,15,275,00:21:32:16,00:21:34:17,"If I do that, everyone will find out."
1,15,276,00:21:35:18,00:21:39:04,"And right now, I am not strong enough
to protect my master."
1,15,277,00:21:44:04,00:21:46:05,I wonder what Master Lee plans to do.
1,15,278,00:22:15:00,00:22:16:05,"Assistant Gwanju, sir."
1,15,279,00:22:17:06,00:22:18:15,What is it?
1,15,280,00:22:22:03,00:22:26:17,"Fluffy is the gift that
Master Lee brought for His Majesty?"
1,15,281,00:22:26:19,00:22:30:11,"Master Lee told me that
the dog will follow you inside."
1,15,282,00:22:31:01,00:22:32:15,"But still, be careful."
1,15,283,00:22:33:14,00:22:36:18,"Is it that dangerous
to take this dog into the palace?"
1,15,284,00:22:37:07,00:22:38:12,What is the big deal?
1,15,285,00:22:40:00,00:22:40:24,It is Gwigu.
1,15,286,00:22:41:19,00:22:43:07,He is bringing Gwigu into the palace.
1,15,287,00:22:44:16,00:22:45:23,But Gwigu is a wily beast.
1,15,288,00:22:46:21,00:22:48:17,"How could he bring
a wily beast into the palace?"
1,15,289,00:22:50:19,00:22:54:05,"Master Seo Gyeong,
who was my master long ago,"
1,15,290,00:22:54:07,00:22:57:00,"used Gwigu to find evil relics
that were created with sorcery"
1,15,291,00:22:57:03,00:22:59:21,using the power of the ice stone.
1,15,292,00:22:59:24,00:23:01:16,"Yes, I have heard of it."
1,15,293,00:23:01:18,00:23:04:17,"However, I was told that it became useless"
1,15,294,00:23:04:20,00:23:06:18,after Gwigu's pottery broke.
1,15,295,00:23:06:20,00:23:07:19,That is why
1,15,296,00:23:08:15,00:23:12:21,"I moved the spirit of Gwigu
from the pottery into a dead dog."
1,15,297,00:23:15:03,00:23:16:17,The dog that will soon arrive
1,15,298,00:23:17:18,00:23:18:24,is Gwigu.
1,15,299,00:23:21:22,00:23:22:23,Gwigu?
1,15,300,00:23:27:12,00:23:28:14,What should we do?
1,15,301,00:23:30:02,00:23:31:23,How many of us are in the palace?
1,15,302,00:23:32:13,00:23:33:17,There are more than ten.
1,15,303,00:23:34:07,00:23:35:16,Did you report this to Cheonbugwan?
1,15,304,00:23:35:18,00:23:38:15,"I sent someone there,
so they will be here soon."
1,15,305,00:24:04:11,00:24:08:20,"We arranged today's meeting to make peace
between Songrim and the royal family."
1,15,306,00:24:09:12,00:24:12:20,"The Crown Prince was kind enough
to visit you and invite you over himself."
1,15,307,00:24:12:22,00:24:14:11,But you wish to bring this wily beast
1,15,308,00:24:14:13,00:24:16:17,"into the place
without His Majesty's permission?"
1,15,309,00:24:16:19,00:24:18:19,He gave me permission to bring in the dog.
1,15,310,00:24:18:21,00:24:20:16,"And right now, Gwigu cannot go wild"
1,15,311,00:24:20:18,00:24:23:11,"and cause danger
since it lives inside the body of a dog."
1,15,312,00:24:23:13,00:24:26:16,"So it cannot harm a soul shifter
even if it sees one?"
1,15,313,00:24:26:18,00:24:30:06,"Instead, it will let you know by barking."
1,15,314,00:24:31:13,00:24:32:15,Bark.
1,15,315,00:24:33:20,00:24:34:20,Bark!
1,15,316,00:24:46:14,00:24:48:17,"Oh, my goodness!"
1,15,317,00:24:52:14,00:24:53:24,It is a soul shifter.
1,15,318,00:24:54:21,00:24:57:23,"As expected, there are
more soul shifters within the palace."
1,15,319,00:25:04:11,00:25:05:14,What was that sound?
1,15,320,00:25:06:08,00:25:09:13,"Does this mean there is a soul shifter
inside my palace?"
1,15,321,00:25:11:08,00:25:12:09,It seems so.
1,15,322,00:25:13:02,00:25:15:15,Then why are you just standing there?
1,15,323,00:25:15:17,00:25:18:10,Get out there and catch the soul shifter.
1,15,324,00:25:18:12,00:25:21:09,"Like I told you earlier,
I brought the dog as a gift."
1,15,325,00:25:21:11,00:25:24:08,I will leave it here with you.
1,15,326,00:25:24:10,00:25:26:16,"You can use it to find
or catch the soul shifters"
1,15,327,00:25:26:18,00:25:28:09,"inside the palace, Your Majesty."
1,15,328,00:25:29:04,00:25:30:24,Take it away. We do not need it.
1,15,329,00:25:31:15,00:25:34:05,"How dare you bring a wily beast
inside the palace!"
1,15,330,00:25:34:07,00:25:35:22,His Majesty already suffers from anxiety.
1,15,331,00:25:35:24,00:25:38:21,"Are you trying to harm him
with that wily beast of yours?"
1,15,332,00:25:41:06,00:25:44:21,"Mother, we were the ones
who invited Master Lee to the palace."
1,15,333,00:25:44:24,00:25:46:16,Stay out of this.
1,15,334,00:25:47:13,00:25:51:03,"The mages of Cheonbugwan
are in charge of protecting the palace."
1,15,335,00:25:51:05,00:25:53:11,"If there is anything made with sorcery
inside the palace,"
1,15,336,00:25:53:13,00:25:55:09,they will be the ones to get rid of it.
1,15,337,00:25:55:11,00:25:58:00,"I do not wish for a wily beast
living inside a dead dog"
1,15,338,00:25:58:02,00:25:59:22,and the people of Songrim to interfere.
1,15,339,00:26:00:10,00:26:03:07,It is merely an attempt to humiliate us.
1,15,340,00:26:05:08,00:26:07:05,"You must stop them, Your Majesty."
1,15,341,00:26:35:02,00:26:37:17,"The son of Cheonbugwan's Gwanju
should be protecting the royal family,"
1,15,342,00:26:37:19,00:26:39:18,but you brought in a wily beast instead.
1,15,343,00:26:41:14,00:26:43:17,It is Master Lee's gift for the King.
1,15,344,00:26:43:19,00:26:45:07,Please let us in.
1,15,345,00:26:45:09,00:26:47:18,I was told to safely bring him inside.
1,15,346,00:26:53:09,00:26:54:09,Is that so?
1,15,347,00:26:54:11,00:26:56:08,Then try your best to get inside.
1,15,348,00:26:56:23,00:26:58:20,"Kill the wily beast
that has trespassed the palace."
1,15,349,00:27:01:08,00:27:04:07,"If you successfully bring him in,
I shall give you a reward."
1,15,350,00:27:04:21,00:27:07:15,"Damn it.
Is this why he picked me to do this?"
1,15,351,00:27:36:01,00:27:37:17,"Your Majesty, it is I, Jin Mu."
1,15,352,00:27:38:07,00:27:40:22,"I shall get rid of
these insolent men from Songrim."
1,15,353,00:27:41:11,00:27:44:11,"His Majesty has invited us here
and we are still talking."
1,15,354,00:27:44:13,00:27:46:14,"Jin Mu, this is not
your place to interfere."
1,15,355,00:27:46:16,00:27:48:24,"How dare you bring in that dog
without permission!"
1,15,356,00:27:49:01,00:27:50:16,What kind of crazy act is this?
1,15,357,00:27:50:18,00:27:51:24,Silence.
1,15,358,00:28:08:09,00:28:10:17,Guards! What are you doing? Stop that man!
1,15,359,00:28:15:06,00:28:16:09,Father.
1,15,360,00:28:16:12,00:28:18:01,You must stop both of them.
1,15,361,00:28:18:03,00:28:20:10,"If this leads to a fight,
it will end our relationship with Songrim."
1,15,362,00:28:20:24,00:28:21:23,We must fight.
1,15,363,00:28:22:00,00:28:24:23,"Songrim has brought
a wily beast into the royal palace."
1,15,364,00:28:25:00,00:28:26:15,It is Cheonbugwan's job to protect us.
1,15,365,00:28:27:09,00:28:29:05,"-Father!
-Your Majesty!"
1,15,366,00:28:33:21,00:28:34:23,I order all of you…
1,15,367,00:28:37:00,00:28:38:02,to stop.
1,15,368,00:28:57:09,00:28:58:16,Stop!
1,15,369,00:29:13:08,00:29:14:14,Master Lee.
1,15,370,00:29:14:16,00:29:17:11,"I invited you over for a friendly meeting.
Did you have to shock me like this?"
1,15,371,00:29:18:03,00:29:19:16,I am sorry if I startled you.
1,15,372,00:29:20:15,00:29:24:00,"Your Majesty, if the ice stone
gets revealed to the world,"
1,15,373,00:29:24:02,00:29:26:13,a greater conflict will arise.
1,15,374,00:29:27:03,00:29:28:05,The ice stone?
1,15,375,00:29:28:07,00:29:29:24,Is it because of the soul shifters?
1,15,376,00:29:30:01,00:29:31:15,People have occasionally used
1,15,377,00:29:31:18,00:29:34:18,"the remaining Soul Ejectors
to shift souls after the Great Chaos."
1,15,378,00:29:35:11,00:29:39:10,"Someone seems to be
making Soul Ejectors again."
1,15,379,00:29:41:08,00:29:44:17,The ice stone has come out into the world.
1,15,380,00:29:50:21,00:29:51:23,So what are you saying?
1,15,381,00:29:51:24,00:29:54:04,Where is it? In whose hands?
1,15,382,00:29:54:23,00:29:56:17,Probably in the hands of those
1,15,383,00:29:56:19,00:30:00:07,"who sent Naksu here and turned
a Songrim mage into a soul shifter."
1,15,384,00:30:00:22,00:30:02:13,I was told that Master Seo Gyeong
1,15,385,00:30:02:15,00:30:04:23,"destroyed all the ice stones 200 years ago
after the Great Chaos."
1,15,386,00:30:05:00,00:30:05:23,"However,"
1,15,387,00:30:06:00,00:30:09:23,"I guess not all were destroyed
and instead left in Songrim."
1,15,388,00:30:10:00,00:30:13:13,It is not easy to quell human desires.
1,15,389,00:30:13:16,00:30:14:17,"However,"
1,15,390,00:30:16:00,00:30:17:18,the return of the ice stone
1,15,391,00:30:17:20,00:30:21:01,"also implies the return
of a great man like Master Seo Gyeong."
1,15,392,00:30:24:07,00:30:27:08,"Master Seo Gyeong was born
with the energy of the King's Star."
1,15,393,00:30:27:22,00:30:30:00,"However, he did not become the king."
1,15,394,00:30:31:18,00:30:33:02,Are you saying there could be
1,15,395,00:30:33:22,00:30:36:09,"another person born with the energy
of the King's Star?"
1,15,396,00:30:41:05,00:30:43:15,"Even if he exists,
the light he emits will be faint."
1,15,397,00:30:43:17,00:30:47:23,"And the energy of the seven stars
surrounding him will not show yet."
1,15,398,00:30:49:00,00:30:51:05,"A power strong enough
to defy the laws of nature"
1,15,399,00:30:51:07,00:30:55:04,"and bring chaos to the world
has returned once again."
1,15,400,00:30:55:06,00:30:57:09,"Thus, someone strong enough
to stop it should also appear."
1,15,401,00:30:58:05,00:30:59:08,"That way,"
1,15,402,00:31:00:15,00:31:03:16,"the world will be able
to maintain balance."
1,15,403,00:31:09:16,00:31:14:10,"What I am trying to say is that
there is no need to feel so anxious."
1,15,404,00:31:15:21,00:31:19:11,I hope this helps you calm your anxiety.
1,15,405,00:31:24:17,00:31:27:02,Thank you for your words of comfort.
1,15,406,00:31:27:23,00:31:30:12,Then I should leave now.
1,15,407,00:31:31:05,00:31:33:14,"As you refused to accept my gift,"
1,15,408,00:31:33:16,00:31:36:08,I will take Gwigu back with me.
1,15,409,00:31:38:01,00:31:40:01,"-Your Majesty.
-Do as you please."
1,15,410,00:31:59:10,00:32:01:13,"No, wait. Stop."
1,15,411,00:32:02:09,00:32:04:05,Are we leaving?
1,15,412,00:32:04:07,00:32:05:20,I saw everything that I needed to see.
1,15,413,00:32:08:07,00:32:11:00,"Does this mean there is a soul shifter
inside my palace?"
1,15,414,00:32:11:12,00:32:13:03,Take it away. We do not need it.
1,15,415,00:32:13:05,00:32:15:20,"How dare you bring a wily beast
inside the palace!"
1,15,416,00:32:17:04,00:32:18:23,"They revealed themselves
after I instilled fear."
1,15,417,00:32:22:15,00:32:24:07,You must have been startled.
1,15,418,00:32:24:10,00:32:25:24,Are you all right?
1,15,419,00:32:26:01,00:32:27:21,How did you get hurt?
1,15,420,00:32:29:01,00:32:32:00,"The dog did not get hurt.
But thanks to you, I did."
1,15,421,00:32:33:19,00:32:34:20,Did you get hurt?
1,15,422,00:32:35:12,00:32:37:24,"I cannot believe you got hurt
fighting those goons."
1,15,423,00:32:38:02,00:32:39:21,"He still has a long way to go, right?"
1,15,424,00:32:42:06,00:32:44:01,Wait. I see blood. Are you hurt?
1,15,425,00:32:44:21,00:32:46:01,That is my blood.
1,15,426,00:32:46:03,00:32:47:10,He did not get hurt at all…
1,15,427,00:32:48:03,00:32:50:04,"-Wait, blood…
-You are bleeding."
1,15,428,00:32:50:21,00:32:52:19,Thank goodness.
1,15,429,00:32:58:04,00:32:59:12,Does it hurt?
1,15,430,00:33:01:06,00:33:02:11,I guess it does.
1,15,431,00:33:03:01,00:33:05:10,It hurts. My gosh.
1,15,432,00:33:14:23,00:33:17:03,That Gwigu belongs to Master Lee.
1,15,433,00:33:17:15,00:33:20:13,How much does he know about Mu-deok?
1,15,434,00:33:21:13,00:33:23:12,And what will Uk do
1,15,435,00:33:23:14,00:33:25:09,if he finds out about Naksu?
1,15,436,00:33:34:01,00:33:35:02,Are you all right?
1,15,437,00:33:36:14,00:33:37:17,You are hurt all over.
1,15,438,00:33:37:20,00:33:39:13,I am fine.
1,15,439,00:33:39:16,00:33:42:08,"Did you find the soul shifters?
What about the ice stone?"
1,15,440,00:33:43:13,00:33:44:24,You have no idea.
1,15,441,00:33:45:17,00:33:48:00,"My soul almost shifted
because of the chaos."
1,15,442,00:33:48:15,00:33:51:02,"So you caused a scene
but failed to find anyone?"
1,15,443,00:33:51:04,00:33:54:15,"You should have at least
let the dog bite someone."
1,15,444,00:33:55:06,00:33:56:08,Uk.
1,15,445,00:33:56:10,00:33:58:14,Finding a soul shifter in the royal palace
1,15,446,00:33:58:16,00:34:01:00,"is different from finding one
in Songrim or Cheonbugwan."
1,15,447,00:34:02:05,00:34:03:17,"If things get out of hand,"
1,15,448,00:34:03:19,00:34:06:07,"it will turn into a fight
between Songrim and the royal family."
1,15,449,00:34:09:10,00:34:10:09,Let us go.
1,15,450,00:34:10:11,00:34:11:19,You should get treated.
1,15,451,00:34:12:12,00:34:13:12,Master Lee.
1,15,452,00:34:17:01,00:34:19:01,Please wait here for a bit.
1,15,453,00:34:19:03,00:34:22:05,"The Crown Prince has asked me
to escort you to his palace."
1,15,454,00:34:22:20,00:34:25:02,"-The Crown Prince?
-It will rain soon."
1,15,455,00:34:25:04,00:34:27:14,He wants you to stay until the rain stops.
1,15,456,00:34:29:20,00:34:30:22,Let us go then.
1,15,457,00:34:39:18,00:34:42:12,"Uk, you need to take him back first."
1,15,458,00:34:42:14,00:34:44:02,Take him to Songrim.
1,15,459,00:34:45:06,00:34:46:10,Come here.
1,15,460,00:34:47:20,00:34:48:23,Come on.
1,15,461,00:35:01:04,00:35:04:20,"You should have told me
before the people of Songrim arrived!"
1,15,462,00:35:04:22,00:35:06:01,I thought it was just
1,15,463,00:35:06:20,00:35:08:13,going to be a simple meeting.
1,15,464,00:35:09:00,00:35:10:01,"If the Queen is put in danger,"
1,15,465,00:35:10:03,00:35:12:13,"you will also get petrified
just like Eunuch Kim."
1,15,466,00:35:12:15,00:35:14:08,You useless imbecile!
1,15,467,00:35:26:11,00:35:28:13,"Someone born with the energy
of the King's Star"
1,15,468,00:35:28:15,00:35:30:22,"who will follow the footsteps
of Master Seo Gyeong?"
1,15,469,00:35:33:06,00:35:35:20,"If it is revealed that King's Star
was created by sorcery,"
1,15,470,00:35:36:20,00:35:38:18,it will spell the end of Songrim.
1,15,471,00:35:42:17,00:35:45:24,I sent back Gwigu to Songrim.
1,15,472,00:35:47:01,00:35:49:02,I apologize for startling you.
1,15,473,00:35:49:04,00:35:51:10,"After a soul shifter was found in Songrim,"
1,15,474,00:35:51:13,00:35:53:22,"I figured there could be one
in the palace as well."
1,15,475,00:35:54:23,00:35:58:04,"Last time, a soul shifter even tried
to enter the royal palace."
1,15,476,00:35:58:22,00:36:01:00,I heard the person who created
1,15,477,00:36:01:02,00:36:02:21,and killed the soul shifter was Naksu.
1,15,478,00:36:07:07,00:36:08:09,Naksu?
1,15,479,00:36:10:06,00:36:13:02,"The female assassin
who killed many skilled fighters."
1,15,480,00:36:13:18,00:36:15:14,"Heads fell to the ground
wherever she went,"
1,15,481,00:36:15:16,00:36:17:13,which is why she was called Naksu.
1,15,482,00:36:17:15,00:36:21:05,"There are rumors that
she shifted souls and is still alive."
1,15,483,00:36:24:10,00:36:26:01,"Naksu, a soul shifter?"
1,15,484,00:36:27:16,00:36:29:10,What an interesting rumor.
1,15,485,00:37:03:15,00:37:07:06,"I hope Mu-deok gets caught
before Young Master Jang returns."
1,15,486,00:37:10:11,00:37:11:09,"Oh, my goodness!"
1,15,487,00:37:14:13,00:37:16:04,Mu-deok…
1,15,488,00:37:18:12,00:37:19:21,Why are you shaking?
1,15,489,00:37:20:12,00:37:22:20,"Do you really believe
that I killed someone?"
1,15,490,00:37:24:20,00:37:26:20,Come inside.
1,15,491,00:37:32:06,00:37:33:17,Why did you come here?
1,15,492,00:37:34:16,00:37:35:24,To pack your things and run?
1,15,493,00:37:36:02,00:37:38:03,I came to ask you for a favor.
1,15,494,00:37:38:17,00:37:40:23,"The leader of Songrim asked me
to bring you in if I ever saw you."
1,15,495,00:37:41:23,00:37:43:02,Mu-deok.
1,15,496,00:37:43:04,00:37:44:11,"It was not you, was it?"
1,15,497,00:37:45:04,00:37:48:00,"-It was not me.
-Then why did you run away?"
1,15,498,00:37:48:17,00:37:50:02,The situation made me do so.
1,15,499,00:37:51:11,00:37:52:19,Mu-deok.
1,15,500,00:37:53:13,00:37:54:15,Do you have
1,15,501,00:37:55:13,00:37:57:10,some big secret you are hiding?
1,15,502,00:38:02:22,00:38:04:05,Does Young Master Jang
1,15,503,00:38:05:08,00:38:07:00,also know about your secret?
1,15,504,00:38:13:01,00:38:16:15,"Mu-deok, I want you to run away."
1,15,505,00:38:17:05,00:38:18:07,I will give you enough money.
1,15,506,00:38:18:09,00:38:19:23,Run away and never come back.
1,15,507,00:38:20:01,00:38:21:04,I cannot do that.
1,15,508,00:38:22:09,00:38:24:18,I cannot leave Young Master Jang.
1,15,509,00:38:24:20,00:38:26:01,Why not?
1,15,510,00:38:27:07,00:38:30:10,"Young Master Jang will only fall
under suspicion if you stay by his side."
1,15,511,00:38:30:12,00:38:31:21,"If you are worried about him,"
1,15,512,00:38:32:16,00:38:34:02,you must help me.
1,15,513,00:38:34:04,00:38:37:02,"You refuse to talk to Songrim's leader
or run away."
1,15,514,00:38:37:17,00:38:39:00,What do you plan to do?
1,15,515,00:38:40:17,00:38:42:13,I must find the real assassin.
1,15,516,00:38:43:24,00:38:48:09,"That assassin is going around
killing everyone that knows them."
1,15,517,00:38:53:10,00:38:55:11,Is this where Cheonbugwan's Gwanju lives?
1,15,518,00:38:56:07,00:38:58:04,It must be a very prestigious family.
1,15,519,00:39:00:03,00:39:03:10,"Does someone from the Jang family
also know you?"
1,15,520,00:39:06:03,00:39:09:08,"Wait over there by the corner.
I will bring that person to you."
1,15,521,00:39:20:03,00:39:22:07,I am going to ask someone to testify
1,15,522,00:39:22:10,00:39:25:24,"that I was not in the room
when those people were killed at the inn."
1,15,523,00:39:27:09,00:39:28:16,Who are you going to ask?
1,15,524,00:39:29:06,00:39:30:15,Young Lady Jin from Jinyowon.
1,15,525,00:39:31:15,00:39:33:04,I ran into her at the inn.
1,15,526,00:39:34:05,00:39:36:09,"That catty young lady will not
agree to see you."
1,15,527,00:39:37:15,00:39:38:20,Maidservant Kim.
1,15,528,00:39:39:24,00:39:42:05,I want you to take me to Jinyowon.
1,15,529,00:39:44:10,00:39:45:10,Jinyowon?
1,15,530,00:40:10:00,00:40:13:11,"I am sorry.
Could you pick up the cane for me?"
1,15,531,00:40:19:22,00:40:20:21,Thank you.
1,15,532,00:40:21:18,00:40:24:07,Can you tell me where I am right now?
1,15,533,00:40:25:01,00:40:29:00,"This is the house of Master Jang,
the Gwanju of Cheonbugwan."
1,15,534,00:40:30:20,00:40:31:24,I see.
1,15,535,00:40:33:00,00:40:34:02,Thank you.
1,15,536,00:40:47:09,00:40:48:15,Mu-deok.
1,15,537,00:40:48:17,00:40:49:18,Let us go.
1,15,538,00:40:57:13,00:40:59:12,I guess Mu-deok really can see now.
1,15,539,00:41:00:03,00:41:02:02,But she did not recognize me.
1,15,540,00:41:02:21,00:41:04:13,I wonder if that is a good thing.
1,15,541,00:41:08:04,00:41:09:10,Why are you alone?
1,15,542,00:41:10:05,00:41:13:03,"I was mistaken.
It turns out I did not know her at all."
1,15,543,00:41:14:13,00:41:16:24,"It is all over now.
Let us return to Cheonbugwan."
1,15,544,00:41:29:03,00:41:30:17,Can I try it?
1,15,545,00:41:30:19,00:41:31:16,"-No.
-No."
1,15,546,00:41:31:18,00:41:33:21,Come on. Stop it.
1,15,547,00:41:33:23,00:41:35:21,I am getting all wet.
1,15,548,00:41:35:23,00:41:37:14,It is that umbrella.
1,15,549,00:41:38:05,00:41:39:03,This is an umbrella.
1,15,550,00:41:40:02,00:41:41:24,You can use this as a cane.
1,15,551,00:41:44:24,00:41:47:12,Stop it. My mom will scold me.
1,15,552,00:41:47:14,00:41:48:12,Stop it already!
1,15,553,00:41:49:04,00:41:51:10,"-No way.
-Hey, kid."
1,15,554,00:41:52:17,00:41:55:17,"Would you like
to switch umbrellas with me?"
1,15,555,00:41:59:15,00:42:03:22,I heard Naksu shifted her soul
1,15,556,00:42:03:24,00:42:07:18,"into the body of
a tall, well-built young man."
1,15,557,00:42:07:20,00:42:11:07,"She could have shifted her soul
into the body of a short, petite woman."
1,15,558,00:42:13:10,00:42:18:00,"If she entered such a weak body,
there would be no need to discard her."
1,15,559,00:42:20:22,00:42:22:01,"No, I am telling you."
1,15,560,00:42:22:14,00:42:24:19,Naksu in Blue was clearly a man.
1,15,561,00:42:25:14,00:42:27:00,"""Naksu in Blue."""
1,15,562,00:42:27:02,00:42:30:11,"-I have also heard of that nickname.
-He covered himself with a blue cloth."
1,15,563,00:42:30:13,00:42:34:15,"It became such a trend
that everyone was wearing blue cloth."
1,15,564,00:42:34:17,00:42:37:02,"People wore blue cloths
because they thought"
1,15,565,00:42:37:04,00:42:40:05,"Naksu in Blue would protect them
from the alchemy of souls."
1,15,566,00:42:41:23,00:42:43:18,"Naksu may have been an assassin,"
1,15,567,00:42:45:05,00:42:48:03,"but she never hurt ordinary people
and was very strong."
1,15,568,00:42:53:19,00:42:56:16,People can be very foolish.
1,15,569,00:42:56:18,00:42:58:08,They are not foolish.
1,15,570,00:42:59:05,00:43:00:11,They are frightened.
1,15,571,00:43:03:05,00:43:05:19,"Naksu's body was burned,
and they all know that"
1,15,572,00:43:06:16,00:43:09:11,"it was done by those
with power and authority."
1,15,573,00:43:11:06,00:43:12:17,Calling them fools
1,15,574,00:43:13:16,00:43:15:21,"when they are actually scared
is negligence."
1,15,575,00:43:25:02,00:43:28:18,"I gathered this meeting
hoping to think of a solution,"
1,15,576,00:43:28:20,00:43:32:00,"but you are arrogant enough
to just sit there and criticize me."
1,15,577,00:43:35:06,00:43:38:24,"I understand that
you two wish to disparage each other,"
1,15,578,00:43:39:01,00:43:42:06,"but I wish for all of us
to get along amicably."
1,15,579,00:43:43:04,00:43:45:10,Master Lee is also here with us.
1,15,580,00:43:45:12,00:43:46:16,Let us drink our tea.
1,15,581,00:43:49:18,00:43:51:01,Your Royal Highness.
1,15,582,00:43:52:01,00:43:53:09,What is it?
1,15,583,00:43:56:20,00:43:59:13,Young Lady Heo wishes to come inside.
1,15,584,00:43:59:15,00:44:00:15,Let her in.
1,15,585,00:44:09:03,00:44:10:10,What brings you here?
1,15,586,00:44:10:13,00:44:12:24,"I heard someone was injured
after getting into a fight."
1,15,587,00:44:13:14,00:44:15:04,I came to take a look.
1,15,588,00:44:17:08,00:44:19:15,There is only one person who got hurt.
1,15,589,00:44:19:17,00:44:22:14,"-Take him out and treat his wound.
-I am all right."
1,15,590,00:44:22:16,00:44:24:04,It will not take long.
1,15,591,00:44:24:06,00:44:25:11,Please come with me.
1,15,592,00:44:37:21,00:44:40:12,It seems like Uk will get engaged again.
1,15,593,00:44:40:14,00:44:41:16,How many times is this?
1,15,594,00:44:41:18,00:44:43:18,"-What do you mean?
-Did you not know?"
1,15,595,00:44:43:20,00:44:46:00,"You really know nothing, do you?"
1,15,596,00:44:46:02,00:44:48:02,Rumor has already spread in Sejukwon.
1,15,597,00:44:48:04,00:44:51:22,"You three are the top potential candidates
to become Heo Yeom's grandson-in-law."
1,15,598,00:44:52:12,00:44:54:03,Uk is the third on his list.
1,15,599,00:44:54:05,00:44:56:01,"But I guess to her, he is the first."
1,15,600,00:44:57:00,00:44:58:24,"Heo Yeom wishes to marry her off
within this year."
1,15,601,00:44:59:01,00:45:01:19,"There will soon be talks of engagement.
I promise you."
1,15,602,00:45:07:21,00:45:11:19,"The cut is not too deep.
This pill can help stop the bleeding."
1,15,603,00:45:11:21,00:45:14:17,"Then you could have just
given it to me earlier."
1,15,604,00:45:14:19,00:45:16:15,I heard you were hurt.
1,15,605,00:45:16:17,00:45:21:02,"I wanted to see for myself
so I could feel at ease."
1,15,606,00:45:23:20,00:45:24:22,Well…
1,15,607,00:45:25:13,00:45:29:22,"You already got hurt from the many duels,
so I was concerned."
1,15,608,00:45:31:00,00:45:32:06,I am fine.
1,15,609,00:45:32:24,00:45:34:05,All right.
1,15,610,00:45:40:11,00:45:44:13,"Oh, right. Maidservant Kim
gave this to me as a gift."
1,15,611,00:45:44:15,00:45:47:05,I have not yet been able to thank you.
1,15,612,00:45:49:00,00:45:50:08,It looks exactly the same.
1,15,613,00:45:55:15,00:45:56:15,What do you mean?
1,15,614,00:45:58:15,00:46:00:24,"It is exactly the same
as the one I have seen for 20 years."
1,15,615,00:46:01:14,00:46:03:16,Is it a valuable item?
1,15,616,00:46:08:08,00:46:09:20,It looks new.
1,15,617,00:46:09:22,00:46:11:22,So it probably is not ours.
1,15,618,00:46:12:17,00:46:14:12,They made it look so similar.
1,15,619,00:46:15:21,00:46:16:17,Goodness.
1,15,620,00:46:17:08,00:46:19:07,The Crown Prince might be right.
1,15,621,00:46:20:11,00:46:22:15,Uk really might get engaged soon.
1,15,622,00:46:22:17,00:46:24:16,"But to Master Heo,
he is the third in line."
1,15,623,00:46:26:24,00:46:29:08,"Then do you plan to marry her
since you are the first in line?"
1,15,624,00:46:30:09,00:46:33:10,"If you get married,
you will have to return to Seoho Fortress."
1,15,625,00:46:33:24,00:46:36:24,"Yul, do not get married.
I will feel lonely without you."
1,15,626,00:46:38:15,00:46:40:22,I can recognize soul shifters.
1,15,627,00:46:49:12,00:46:52:01,"I must take them to Seoho Fortress
as soon as possible."
1,15,628,00:46:52:03,00:46:53:04,Who?
1,15,629,00:46:54:01,00:46:54:23,Me?
1,15,630,00:47:01:02,00:47:02:10,I take that back.
1,15,631,00:47:03:03,00:47:07:18,"I feel very much at ease
after having seen how you reacted today."
1,15,632,00:47:08:08,00:47:09:23,I am relieved to hear that.
1,15,633,00:47:10:21,00:47:12:22,"What is that you wish
to ask me for in private?"
1,15,634,00:47:15:02,00:47:17:16,"I know you took Naksu's sword,"
1,15,635,00:47:17:18,00:47:19:18,"but would it be possible
to give that to me?"
1,15,636,00:47:28:10,00:47:31:15,I did watch the magic show last year.
1,15,637,00:47:32:05,00:47:33:12,I even saw elephants.
1,15,638,00:47:33:24,00:47:37:04,"But I should act like it is my first time
when I go with Young Master Park, right?"
1,15,639,00:47:37:06,00:47:39:20,"So you got those tickets
for you and Young Master Park."
1,15,640,00:47:39:22,00:47:42:01,You startled me. What are you doing here?
1,15,641,00:47:42:03,00:47:44:17,I came to ask you for a favor.
1,15,642,00:47:44:19,00:47:45:22,A favor?
1,15,643,00:47:46:23,00:47:48:07,Do not bother.
1,15,644,00:47:48:10,00:47:51:12,I have no intentions of helping you.
1,15,645,00:47:51:14,00:47:53:04,I am being framed for murder.
1,15,646,00:47:53:23,00:47:55:02,What?
1,15,647,00:47:55:04,00:47:57:10,Can you please tell the leader of Songrim
1,15,648,00:47:58:03,00:48:00:13,that you saw me earlier at the inn?
1,15,649,00:48:01:16,00:48:05:23,"You want me to go to Songrim
and tell him that I had set foot"
1,15,650,00:48:06:12,00:48:07:18,at a place like that?
1,15,651,00:48:08:11,00:48:10:07,I would be mad to do that.
1,15,652,00:48:12:04,00:48:13:20,You are my only hope.
1,15,653,00:48:14:11,00:48:16:08,I beg of you to help.
1,15,654,00:48:19:10,00:48:20:15,No.
1,15,655,00:48:20:17,00:48:22:15,"I told Young Master Park
that I had an extra ticket."
1,15,656,00:48:22:17,00:48:24:14,"I do not want to reveal
I bought them from a scalper."
1,15,657,00:48:24:16,00:48:27:07,"Your embarrassment will only be temporary,"
1,15,658,00:48:27:09,00:48:29:09,but I could really get killed for this.
1,15,659,00:48:30:09,00:48:32:10,"If my mother finds out, she will kill me."
1,15,660,00:48:32:12,00:48:35:06,"There is no way
she would kill her own daughter!"
1,15,661,00:48:35:08,00:48:37:13,"Why are you yelling?
You came to ask for a favor."
1,15,662,00:48:40:07,00:48:43:14,"Then I guess I have no choice
but to tell your mother what happened"
1,15,663,00:48:44:02,00:48:45:17,and ask her to help me instead.
1,15,664,00:48:45:19,00:48:47:10,You are going to ask my mother?
1,15,665,00:48:48:21,00:48:50:09,There she is.
1,15,666,00:48:52:19,00:48:55:20,"You did not need to bring gifts
to apologize for the past."
1,15,667,00:48:57:02,00:49:00:19,"The more I thought about it,
the more apologetic I felt."
1,15,668,00:49:02:04,00:49:04:18,I will go and ask her myself.
1,15,669,00:49:04:20,00:49:05:18,Wait.
1,15,670,00:49:05:20,00:49:08:22,I will think about it. Come with me first.
1,15,671,00:49:17:18,00:49:19:19,I will be right back. Stay here.
1,15,672,00:49:20:09,00:49:21:20,"If you do not come, I will yell."
1,15,673,00:49:21:22,00:49:23:10,"-I will be back.
-Cho-yeon."
1,15,674,00:49:24:05,00:49:25:08,"Yes, Mother."
1,15,675,00:49:26:03,00:49:26:23,Wait here.
1,15,676,00:49:58:07,00:49:59:16,She is a young girl.
1,15,677,00:50:00:24,00:50:02:04,I wonder who she is.
1,15,678,00:50:31:15,00:50:33:06,Is it because of the incense stick?
1,15,679,00:50:37:06,00:50:38:13,What a nice vase.
1,15,680,00:50:39:14,00:50:43:13,"If you put flowers in the vase,
it helps them emit a stronger scent."
1,15,681,00:50:44:19,00:50:46:17,"-Really?
-Yes."
1,15,682,00:50:46:19,00:50:50:00,"I have been wanting to change
the vase in my daughter's room."
1,15,683,00:50:51:01,00:50:51:24,Thank you.
1,15,684,00:50:55:16,00:50:58:17,"Mother, are you going to put the vase
in Bu-yeon's room?"
1,15,685,00:50:58:20,00:51:00:17,"It helps the flowers emit
a stronger scent."
1,15,686,00:51:00:20,00:51:04:11,"Your sister cannot see, so she should
at least enjoy the scent of the flowers."
1,15,687,00:51:48:19,00:51:50:02,How dare you touch that!
1,15,688,00:51:50:04,00:51:52:00,What are you doing in my daughter's room?
1,15,689,00:51:56:22,00:51:58:07,She came with me.
1,15,690,00:51:58:10,00:51:59:21,She must have gotten lost.
1,15,691,00:52:00:11,00:52:02:17,"Mu-deok, what were you doing here?"
1,15,692,00:52:04:24,00:52:06:03,I am sorry.
1,15,693,00:52:07:23,00:52:10:03,"Please help me, just this once."
1,15,694,00:52:11:11,00:52:13:01,Please leave.
1,15,695,00:52:13:03,00:52:14:24,You are not allowed in here.
1,15,696,00:52:15:01,00:52:16:18,All right. Let us leave.
1,15,697,00:52:20:08,00:52:22:04,I promise I will go.
1,15,698,00:52:24:16,00:52:25:18,Cho-yeon.
1,15,699,00:52:26:09,00:52:29:24,"Tell the servants
to clean Bu-yeon's room again."
1,15,700,00:52:30:18,00:52:32:13,"Yes, Mother."
1,15,701,00:53:00:06,00:53:01:06,So-i.
1,15,702,00:53:02:06,00:53:04:01,This man will be your father.
1,15,703,00:53:05:00,00:53:06:03,My father?
1,15,704,00:53:07:01,00:53:09:11,"A father is willing to take in
a fake daughter?"
1,15,705,00:53:12:21,00:53:16:11,I am not the father of Jin Bu-yeon.
1,15,706,00:53:17:24,00:53:21:00,"Jin Bu-yeon's biological father
is someone else."
1,15,707,00:53:33:16,00:53:36:09,"To be acknowledged
as the daughter of the Jin family,"
1,15,708,00:53:36:11,00:53:38:08,you must open the door to Jinyowon.
1,15,709,00:53:38:10,00:53:41:21,"And to do that, the blood
of the Jin family needs to run inside you."
1,15,710,00:53:45:18,00:53:47:01,What is that?
1,15,711,00:53:47:03,00:53:50:12,"A worm that sucked the blood
of a female member of the Jin family."
1,15,712,00:54:12:11,00:54:14:09,"That is the blood of Cho-yeon,"
1,15,713,00:54:15:09,00:54:16:22,my beloved daughter.
1,15,714,00:54:18:19,00:54:20:24,What do you plan to do with that?
1,15,715,00:54:21:01,00:54:22:11,Give me your hand.
1,15,716,00:54:24:15,00:54:26:05,"I said, give me your hand."
1,15,717,00:55:09:17,00:55:12:21,"You now have the blood of the Jin family
running inside you."
1,15,718,00:55:13:23,00:55:16:08,"If I do not use sorcery to keep it alive,"
1,15,719,00:55:16:10,00:55:19:07,"that worm will start eating you
from the inside."
1,15,720,00:55:20:16,00:55:22:06,"If you try to run from me,"
1,15,721,00:55:23:01,00:55:25:08,that worm will eat you alive.
1,15,722,00:55:32:11,00:55:35:03,"That room belonged to her daughter
who died ten years ago."
1,15,723,00:55:36:07,00:55:37:22,"She apparently drowned and died,"
1,15,724,00:55:38:15,00:55:41:04,"but Lady Jin still thinks
she might come back."
1,15,725,00:55:42:18,00:55:43:24,"She is a pitiful woman,"
1,15,726,00:55:44:23,00:55:46:14,so forgive her for slapping you.
1,15,727,00:55:49:18,00:55:52:19,"By any chance, was that daughter blind?"
1,15,728,00:55:53:17,00:55:55:24,"Yes, she was."
1,15,729,00:55:57:06,00:55:59:12,"The owner of this body
used to be blind as well."
1,15,730,00:56:00:06,00:56:02:15,"Could that be why
I suddenly felt something earlier?"
1,15,731,00:56:20:02,00:56:23:05,"Master Lee wanted to talk
to the Crown Prince in private."
1,15,732,00:56:23:20,00:56:24:20,I see.
1,15,733,00:56:30:00,00:56:32:24,"The leader has asked us
to escort you to Songrim."
1,15,734,00:56:33:13,00:56:35:13,Just me? Why?
1,15,735,00:56:35:16,00:56:36:16,Come with us.
1,15,736,00:56:47:03,00:56:48:18,Am I getting locked in here again?
1,15,737,00:56:49:05,00:56:51:01,"-What is going on?
-It is--"
1,15,738,00:56:51:19,00:56:53:03,We were told to stay silent.
1,15,739,00:56:53:22,00:56:55:03,Wait here until he comes.
1,15,740,00:57:04:20,00:57:08:02,"Mu-deok was found near the bodies,
so I get why she was taken away."
1,15,741,00:57:08:04,00:57:10:17,"But why Young Master Jang?
He was at the palace."
1,15,742,00:57:12:01,00:57:14:15,What is the leader of Songrim thinking?
1,15,743,00:57:14:17,00:57:15:17,I do not know either.
1,15,744,00:57:18:07,00:57:19:08,Yul.
1,15,745,00:57:19:10,00:57:21:13,Mu-deok would never kill anyone.
1,15,746,00:57:22:04,00:57:23:06,Right?
1,15,747,00:57:26:08,00:57:28:13,May I take a look at the bodies?
1,15,748,00:57:41:10,00:57:43:07,It was done by a skilled swordsman.
1,15,749,00:57:43:22,00:57:45:13,It could not have been Mu-deok.
1,15,750,00:57:47:04,00:57:48:19,"But she is the assassin, Naksu."
1,15,751,00:57:49:17,00:57:51:11,She could have killed those men.
1,15,752,00:57:56:15,00:57:59:13,"I have a good reason for doing this,"
1,15,753,00:57:59:16,00:58:01:01,so just go on your way.
1,15,754,00:58:04:16,00:58:07:11,"-They are those thugs.
-Do you know them?"
1,15,755,00:58:09:19,00:58:12:00,"I got into a fight with them
some time ago."
1,15,756,00:58:17:07,00:58:19:20,"Can I take their bodies now
and hold a funeral for them?"
1,15,757,00:58:26:09,00:58:28:12,What brings the owner of Chwiseonru here?
1,15,758,00:58:28:14,00:58:30:02,Did someone die?
1,15,759,00:58:30:04,00:58:32:15,Our guards got killed.
1,15,760,00:58:45:23,00:58:47:07,Young Master Park.
1,15,761,00:58:47:09,00:58:49:07,Maidservant Kim told me what happened.
1,15,762,00:58:51:05,00:58:52:15,Young Lady Jin.
1,15,763,00:58:53:15,00:58:55:06,Please help Mu-deok.
1,15,764,00:59:03:03,00:59:05:22,"I went to the inn
to buy tickets from scalpers."
1,15,765,00:59:07:17,00:59:09:14,And I saw Mu-deok there.
1,15,766,00:59:11:16,00:59:12:18,"But of course,"
1,15,767,00:59:12:19,00:59:16:14,"it was my first time
going to such a place."
1,15,768,00:59:17:04,00:59:18:06,I know.
1,15,769,00:59:19:02,00:59:22:21,"We talked for a bit,
and right after Mu-deok went inside,"
1,15,770,00:59:22:23,00:59:24:22,"I saw you coming in, my lord."
1,15,771,00:59:25:20,00:59:30:07,"And of course,
I never thought I would meet you there."
1,15,772,00:59:31:23,00:59:33:02,I know.
1,15,773,00:59:36:14,00:59:37:24,"Judging by the circumstances,"
1,15,774,00:59:39:00,00:59:43:03,"there is no way Mu-deok had enough time
to kill all those men."
1,15,775,00:59:44:04,00:59:47:09,"A girl recently came
to Chwiseonru and looked for Mu-deok,"
1,15,776,00:59:47:11,00:59:48:22,pretending to be a mage.
1,15,777,00:59:49:00,00:59:50:12,The owner of Chwiseonru thinks
1,15,778,00:59:50:14,00:59:54:13,"it might have been So-i,
the girl that the broker warned her about."
1,15,779,00:59:54:15,00:59:57:00,"I once saw a girl
arguing with those thugs."
1,15,780,00:59:58:08,00:59:59:15,"The dead broker,"
1,15,781,00:59:59:16,01:00:00:24,"thugs, and guards."
1,15,782,01:00:01:21,01:00:04:02,"They all had something to do
with that girl, So-i."
1,15,783,01:00:04:04,01:00:06:00,"That swindler, So-i, seems suspicious."
1,15,784,01:00:06:22,01:00:09:03,"In any case, it means Mu-deok is innocent."
1,15,785,01:00:10:17,01:00:11:18,All right.
1,15,786,01:00:12:18,01:00:17:08,"I also did not think that
Mu-deok would have committed murder."
1,15,787,01:00:17:10,01:00:21:13,"I knew it. You knew that Mu-deok would
never do such a thing, right?"
1,15,788,01:00:21:15,01:00:25:03,Then can you release Uk and Mu-deok now?
1,15,789,01:00:25:06,01:00:27:12,The reason I locked both of them up
1,15,790,01:00:28:09,01:00:30:08,was to ask them about something else.
1,15,791,01:00:31:09,01:00:32:21,I will take care of it from here.
1,15,792,01:00:32:24,01:00:34:02,You may all leave.
1,15,793,01:00:34:04,01:00:35:08,All right.
1,15,794,01:00:54:06,01:00:55:13,My lord.
1,15,795,01:00:56:06,01:00:58:22,"What is this?
At least tell me what is going on."
1,15,796,01:00:59:17,01:01:02:03,Mu-deok committed murder.
1,15,797,01:01:05:07,01:01:06:07,What--
1,15,798,01:01:06:09,01:01:09:11,She killed those who knew about her past.
1,15,799,01:01:12:15,01:01:16:16,"Tell me what it is that you and Mu-deok
are hiding from me."
1,15,800,01:01:17:21,01:01:20:07,"If your statement
does not match Mu-deok's,"
1,15,801,01:01:20:22,01:01:23:05,"you will not be able
to leave this Secret Room."
1,15,802,01:01:24:01,01:01:25:20,And Mu-deok will die.
1,15,803,01:01:47:03,01:01:48:16,"My lord, hear me out--"
1,15,804,01:01:48:18,01:01:50:01,This is not about the murders.
1,15,805,01:01:52:01,01:01:54:00,Uk has told me your secret.
1,15,806,01:01:55:07,01:01:56:13,He told me everything.
1,15,807,01:02:00:03,01:02:04:01,"If you also tell me the truth,
I shall spare your life."
1,15,808,01:02:05:04,01:02:06:08,"However,"
1,15,809,01:02:06:10,01:02:09:13,"if anything that you say
differs from what he said,"
1,15,810,01:02:11:10,01:02:12:22,you will die.
1,15,811,01:02:21:20,01:02:23:17,"If he found out she was a soul shifter,"
1,15,812,01:02:23:19,01:02:25:18,he would not waste time like this.
1,15,813,01:02:25:20,01:02:28:10,"He is trying to test us
by interrogating us separately."
1,15,814,01:02:29:06,01:02:31:14,We have to say the same thing.
1,15,815,01:02:33:09,01:02:36:15,"What would Uk have said
to the same question?"
1,15,816,01:02:36:17,01:02:40:13,"A secret that ensures
that we say the same thing."
1,15,817,01:02:40:15,01:02:45:05,"A secret that is private
but will not get me killed if revealed."
1,15,818,01:02:48:07,01:02:49:19,I will tell you the truth.
1,15,819,01:02:49:21,01:02:51:05,I will tell you my secret.
1,15,820,01:02:58:22,01:03:00:09,What happened?
1,15,821,01:03:01:09,01:03:03:08,Both Mu-deok and Uk
1,15,822,01:03:04:04,01:03:05:07,can be set free.
1,15,823,01:03:05:20,01:03:08:21,"What did they say?
Did they say the same thing?"
1,15,824,01:03:12:01,01:03:15:01,They both did say the same thing.
1,15,825,01:03:44:14,01:03:47:11,"-You got out.
-So did you."
1,15,826,01:03:48:00,01:03:50:22,"-I am relieved that you are all right.
-Yes, me too."
1,15,827,01:03:50:24,01:03:52:20,Thank goodness we said the same thing.
1,15,828,01:03:54:09,01:03:55:21,What did you say?
1,15,829,01:03:55:23,01:03:57:16,The fact that we both got out…
1,15,830,01:03:59:01,01:04:01:01,"means you said
the same thing as what I said."
1,15,831,01:04:06:00,01:04:09:11,"You separately locked them up
to find out what they were hiding."
1,15,832,01:04:09:13,01:04:11:11,I guess you got something out of them.
1,15,833,01:04:11:13,01:04:12:09,Tell me.
1,15,834,01:04:12:11,01:04:14:21,What was the secret they were hiding?
1,15,835,01:04:15:19,01:04:17:04,The two of them…
1,15,836,01:04:18:06,01:04:21:18,"told me a secret
that completely shut me up."
1,15,837,01:04:24:14,01:04:27:04,They both showed me the same thing.
1,15,838,01:04:29:02,01:04:30:12,I will tell you the truth.
1,15,839,01:04:31:10,01:04:33:00,I tried not to let it show.
1,15,840,01:04:34:07,01:04:36:01,This is what I kept inside.
1,15,841,01:04:53:18,01:04:55:05,"You see, I…"
1,15,842,01:04:55:18,01:04:58:02,I actually…
1,15,843,01:05:05:01,01:05:06:17,I like Mu-deok a lot.
1,15,844,01:05:10:13,01:05:12:09,I like Young Master Jang very much.
1,15,845,01:05:18:18,01:05:21:05,"I figured it would ensure
that we said the same thing."
1,15,846,01:05:23:01,01:05:25:10,"It was not crucial enough
to get me killed."
1,15,847,01:05:25:12,01:05:29:06,"Right. Songrim's Book of Regulations
does not state anything about"
1,15,848,01:05:29:08,01:05:31:18,"punishing young men and women
for falling in love."
1,15,849,01:05:34:22,01:05:35:17,Exactly.
1,15,850,01:05:35:20,01:05:39:21,"They would not kill a maid
for loving her owner to death."
1,15,851,01:05:41:23,01:05:45:05,"You said that?
You told him that you loved me to death?"
1,15,852,01:05:46:24,01:05:48:02,Well…
1,15,853,01:05:48:20,01:05:52:00,"I just exaggerated
because I had to convince him."
1,15,854,01:05:55:07,01:05:56:20,I had no choice but to say it.
1,15,855,01:05:58:05,01:06:01:17,"You had no choice but to admit
that you loved me to death."
1,15,856,01:06:02:22,01:06:04:15,"Gosh, I feel so bad."
1,15,857,01:06:05:08,01:06:07:17,"I was not as passionate
when I expressed my feelings."
1,15,858,01:06:08:06,01:06:09:13,I guess I should try harder.
1,15,859,01:06:09:15,01:06:10:20,Forget it.
1,15,860,01:06:12:14,01:06:16:15,"Do not put everything on the line
for something as fickle as love."
1,15,861,01:06:17:23,01:06:19:21,"If something like this ever happens again,"
1,15,862,01:06:20:15,01:06:22:22,"and you find yourself
in a life or death situation,"
1,15,863,01:06:23:24,01:06:25:05,give up on love…
1,15,864,01:06:26:13,01:06:27:18,and choose your life.
1,15,865,01:06:30:02,01:06:31:18,Do that if you do not wish to die.
1,15,866,01:06:32:16,01:06:34:04,That is an order from your master.
1,15,867,01:06:39:06,01:06:40:09,Master.
1,15,868,01:06:41:02,01:06:42:15,What if I do not mind dying?
1,15,869,01:06:43:10,01:06:45:20,"Then can I hold onto it
and keep loving you?"
1,15,870,01:06:48:07,01:06:50:10,"I told you that
I am willing to risk it all"
1,15,871,01:06:51:09,01:06:53:04,and that we are in this together.
1,15,872,01:06:54:13,01:06:56:04,I will keep going no matter what.
1,15,873,01:06:56:18,01:07:01:04,"So you should do the same
and stick to your confession."
1,15,874,01:07:02:18,01:07:04:07,Keep loving me to death.
