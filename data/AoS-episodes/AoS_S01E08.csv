"1","8","1","00:00:51:12","00:00:52:16","Is that the alchemy of souls?"
"1","8","2","00:01:07:13","00:01:11:24","Is my soul being shifted right now?"
"1","8","3","00:02:59:23","00:03:01:08","My soul did not shift."
"1","8","4","00:03:02:22","00:03:04:06","What happened?"
"1","8","5","00:03:12:00","00:03:13:01","Jang Uk."
"1","8","6","00:03:14:02","00:03:15:06","Uk!"
"1","8","7","00:03:18:11","00:03:19:17","Uk!"
"1","8","8","00:03:20:21","00:03:22:00","Uk!"
"1","8","9","00:03:37:04","00:03:40:21","So you have shifted souls
with my pupil, Gil-ju."
"1","8","10","00:03:42:15","00:03:43:17","Mu-deok."
"1","8","11","00:03:47:11","00:03:50:00","I may have been too weak
to protect him from you."
"1","8","12","00:03:50:22","00:03:53:08","But I will make sure to end your life."
"1","8","13","00:03:59:04","00:04:00:11","I did not know"
"1","8","14","00:04:01:06","00:04:03:06","you cared about Jang Uk that much."
"1","8","15","00:04:03:24","00:04:05:05","Shut it!"
"1","8","16","00:04:07:08","00:04:08:12","Master!"
"1","8","17","00:04:09:14","00:04:10:17","It is me, Jang Uk."
"1","8","18","00:04:11:15","00:04:12:21","We did not shift souls."
"1","8","19","00:04:15:05","00:04:17:05","Look into my eyes."
"1","8","20","00:04:18:08","00:04:19:20","It is me, right?"
"1","8","21","00:04:24:07","00:04:27:01","I am the only one
who can look at you from this close."
"1","8","22","00:04:30:19","00:04:32:02","Do you recognize me?"
"1","8","23","00:05:53:17","00:05:56:00","He had the blue mark on his body."
"1","8","24","00:05:57:20","00:06:00:17","His soul must have re-entered his body."
"1","8","25","00:06:01:19","00:06:03:01","Then why am I fine?"
"1","8","26","00:06:03:03","00:06:04:02","You are wrong."
"1","8","27","00:06:04:20","00:06:06:10","You have changed as well. Look."
"1","8","28","00:06:07:17","00:06:09:22","You do not have the bracelet,
yet you are not trembling."
"1","8","29","00:06:12:10","00:06:15:11","You are right. I can move it freely now."
"1","8","30","00:06:15:13","00:06:17:23","The Soul Ejector helped surge your energy."
"1","8","31","00:06:18:00","00:06:21:17","The poison opened your gate of energy,
and the Soul Ejector surged your energy."
"1","8","32","00:06:22:19","00:06:26:02","Uk, you truly are astoundingly lucky."
"1","8","33","00:06:32:19","00:06:35:14","I am certain that I saw you there."
"1","8","34","00:06:36:13","00:06:37:16","What?"
"1","8","35","00:06:57:22","00:06:59:07","Why?"
"1","8","36","00:07:00:06","00:07:01:20","Why are you fine?"
"1","8","37","00:07:01:21","00:07:04:20","You must have failed
due to your weak energy."
"1","8","38","00:07:04:23","00:07:07:01","You are a soul shifter as well."
"1","8","39","00:07:07:03","00:07:08:24","Naksu, you will also"
"1","8","40","00:07:09:22","00:07:11:23","be petrified and perish eventually."
"1","8","41","00:07:13:01","00:07:15:01","Just like me"
"1","8","42","00:07:16:06","00:07:17:22","and your father."
"1","8","43","00:07:22:20","00:07:23:22","My father?"
"1","8","44","00:07:24:14","00:07:25:14","That is right."
"1","8","45","00:07:26:01","00:07:28:22","The constellation recorder mage."
"1","8","46","00:07:29:13","00:07:30:17","Cho Chung!"
"1","8","47","00:07:32:14","00:07:34:00","My father…"
"1","8","48","00:07:36:21","00:07:38:07","was a soul shifter?"
"1","8","49","00:07:41:05","00:07:45:16","The four families were not the ones
who killed your entire family."
"1","8","50","00:07:47:03","00:07:51:06","It was your father.
He had run wild and murdered them all."
"1","8","51","00:07:53:09","00:07:55:09","Stay inside and do not come out."
"1","8","52","00:07:55:11","00:07:58:09","If you see your father, run away."
"1","8","53","00:07:58:11","00:08:00:02","Do not let him catch you."
"1","8","54","00:08:03:12","00:08:07:17","Both you and your father were exploited"
"1","8","55","00:08:08:11","00:08:10:19","and will eventually be petrified and die."
"1","8","56","00:08:11:18","00:08:13:18","Was the man who shifted my father's soul,"
"1","8","57","00:08:15:02","00:08:16:07","the Danju,"
"1","8","58","00:08:17:09","00:08:19:09","Jin Mu of Cheonbugwan?"
"1","8","59","00:08:19:23","00:08:22:22","Jin Mu is not our true Danju."
"1","8","60","00:08:23:16","00:08:26:13","The real Danju is someone else."
"1","8","61","00:08:27:11","00:08:29:16","-And who is that?
-The true Danju"
"1","8","62","00:08:30:22","00:08:33:08","can prevent you from running wild"
"1","8","63","00:08:34:08","00:08:37:12","since the real Danju
possesses the ice stone."
"1","8","64","00:08:37:15","00:08:39:21","So who is the real Danju?"
"1","8","65","00:09:04:15","00:09:06:17","Mu-deok, are you all right?"
"1","8","66","00:09:07:23","00:09:09:04","I am fine."
"1","8","67","00:09:10:01","00:09:11:24","Go after him. Hurry!"
"1","8","68","00:09:48:17","00:09:51:01","I must get out of here"
"1","8","69","00:09:51:17","00:09:53:17","before the poison
from the sorcery spreads."
"1","8","70","00:10:18:03","00:10:19:08","Search the area."
"1","8","71","00:10:19:10","00:10:20:16","-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir."
"1","8","72","00:10:44:06","00:10:45:05","It is empty."
"1","8","73","00:10:50:20","00:10:52:17","It felt the energy of the sorcery."
"1","8","74","00:10:52:19","00:10:55:21","Master Heo was right.
This Sapsali was indeed Gwigu."
"1","8","75","00:10:56:12","00:10:58:19","Did the alchemy of souls
really take place here?"
"1","8","76","00:11:07:21","00:11:08:19","What are those?"
"1","8","77","00:11:09:09","00:11:10:18","They were on the ground."
"1","8","78","00:11:11:21","00:11:13:03","Maybe this is the Soul Ejector."
"1","8","79","00:11:18:24","00:11:20:03","This bracelet…"
"1","8","80","00:11:21:00","00:11:23:00","Is this not
Young Master Jang's binding bracelet?"
"1","8","81","00:11:23:02","00:11:24:19","Why is this here?"
"1","8","82","00:11:25:09","00:11:26:24","Does this mean Uk was here?"
"1","8","83","00:11:31:19","00:11:32:24","They fought here."
"1","8","84","00:11:33:01","00:11:35:05","Do you think something happened to him?"
"1","8","85","00:11:38:14","00:11:41:03","Please return to Songrim
and report what you saw here."
"1","8","86","00:11:41:19","00:11:44:01","Dang-gu, go inside the fortress
and look for Uk."
"1","8","87","00:11:44:03","00:11:46:01","-I will search this area.
-All right."
"1","8","88","00:12:21:22","00:12:24:10","How did the Songrim mages
know to come here?"
"1","8","89","00:12:41:13","00:12:43:07","You are a soul shifter as well."
"1","8","90","00:12:43:22","00:12:45:14","Naksu, you will also"
"1","8","91","00:12:46:12","00:12:48:18","be petrified and perish eventually."
"1","8","92","00:12:48:20","00:12:50:20","Just like me"
"1","8","93","00:12:51:11","00:12:53:01","and your father."
"1","8","94","00:12:56:19","00:12:57:24","Father."
"1","8","95","00:13:22:08","00:13:23:24","Both you and your father…"
"1","8","96","00:13:25:16","00:13:28:05","were exploited and will eventually"
"1","8","97","00:13:29:17","00:13:31:20","be petrified and die."
"1","8","98","00:15:18:10","00:15:19:14","Why?"
"1","8","99","00:15:20:14","00:15:21:23","Why is it you again?"
"1","8","100","00:15:28:09","00:15:31:05","Is that the soul shifter?"
"1","8","101","00:15:31:07","00:15:33:07","No, she is Uk's maid."
"1","8","102","00:15:34:08","00:15:36:16","I accidentally hurt her,
so I must get her treated."
"1","8","103","00:15:43:14","00:15:46:01","Goodness, what a day."
"1","8","104","00:15:46:03","00:15:48:20","Gosh. Business was good today."
"1","8","105","00:15:54:21","00:15:57:02","I must refill my energy,
or I will be petrified."
"1","8","106","00:15:59:18","00:16:01:19","-Are you done?
-Yes, I am."
"1","8","107","00:16:02:09","00:16:04:05","Then let us have a drink."
"1","8","108","00:16:04:22","00:16:05:23","-All right.
-Hurry up!"
"1","8","109","00:16:06:00","00:16:07:04","Let us go."
"1","8","110","00:16:08:21","00:16:11:03","I cannot return if I cause a commotion."
"1","8","111","00:16:11:05","00:16:14:03","I need to find somewhere quiet
where I can take their energy."
"1","8","112","00:17:04:21","00:17:06:16","Please move aside."
"1","8","113","00:17:08:18","00:17:09:24","Right. Please go ahead."
"1","8","114","00:17:10:22","00:17:11:21","Master."
"1","8","115","00:17:11:23","00:17:14:04","You cannot fool us
with those obvious tricks."
"1","8","116","00:17:15:11","00:17:18:00","You have been following her
ever since you entered the capital."
"1","8","117","00:17:25:12","00:17:27:21","That man has been following us."
"1","8","118","00:17:31:14","00:17:34:24","You followed her all the way to this inn."
"1","8","119","00:17:37:03","00:17:39:10","We just shared
the same destination, that is all."
"1","8","120","00:17:39:12","00:17:40:15","Do not lie."
"1","8","121","00:17:40:18","00:17:43:12","You were staring at her the entire time!"
"1","8","122","00:17:43:15","00:17:44:18","I was not."
"1","8","123","00:17:44:20","00:17:45:20","Sun-i."
"1","8","124","00:17:46:13","00:17:48:04","Do not embarrass him anymore."
"1","8","125","00:17:52:03","00:17:55:14","To follow me to my accommodation
was rude and uncomfortable."
"1","8","126","00:17:56:03","00:17:59:02","If you do not want me
to find another inn this late,"
"1","8","127","00:17:59:05","00:18:00:08","please leave."
"1","8","128","00:18:01:21","00:18:03:04","Lady."
"1","8","129","00:18:03:24","00:18:06:08","Why do you think I was following you?"
"1","8","130","00:18:06:22","00:18:08:19","You are neither my debtor"
"1","8","131","00:18:08:21","00:18:12:03","nor someone I know,
so why do you think I followed you?"
"1","8","132","00:18:12:05","00:18:15:04","-That is because she is very--
-Shut up, Sun-i."
"1","8","133","00:18:16:18","00:18:18:08","I want you to answer me."
"1","8","134","00:18:20:12","00:18:24:18","Many men have given me trouble
because they followed me due to my looks."
"1","8","135","00:18:24:20","00:18:25:24","So I thought"
"1","8","136","00:18:27:04","00:18:28:20","you were just one of them."
"1","8","137","00:18:29:09","00:18:30:05","I see."
"1","8","138","00:18:31:03","00:18:31:24","You are wrong."
"1","8","139","00:18:34:09","00:18:35:18","Your looks did not impress me,"
"1","8","140","00:18:36:11","00:18:38:04","and I did not follow you either."
"1","8","141","00:18:39:21","00:18:41:04","If that is the case,"
"1","8","142","00:18:43:05","00:18:44:13","I am sorry."
"1","8","143","00:18:44:15","00:18:46:13","Then may I go upstairs now?"
"1","8","144","00:18:59:01","00:19:01:11","-Young Lady Heo.
-Yes?"
"1","8","145","00:19:01:13","00:19:03:04","You must eat."
"1","8","146","00:19:05:05","00:19:06:09","Did that scum--"
"1","8","147","00:19:07:08","00:19:08:11","I mean…"
"1","8","148","00:19:09:00","00:19:11:22","Are you that embarrassed
that you might run into him again?"
"1","8","149","00:19:13:03","00:19:14:11","That is not why."
"1","8","150","00:19:15:10","00:19:16:22","I just do not feel well."
"1","8","151","00:19:17:12","00:19:19:05","You should change into dry clothes."
"1","8","152","00:19:19:08","00:19:21:18","I will get some porridge for you."
"1","8","153","00:21:02:09","00:21:03:14","Are you all right?"
"1","8","154","00:21:06:24","00:21:09:18","What was that?"
"1","8","155","00:21:11:00","00:21:12:13","Were you after him?"
"1","8","156","00:21:13:10","00:21:14:15","Yes."
"1","8","157","00:21:16:12","00:21:18:02","I am glad that you are unscathed."
"1","8","158","00:21:18:23","00:21:20:01","Wait."
"1","8","159","00:21:21:18","00:21:22:18","Thank you."
"1","8","160","00:21:23:06","00:21:24:19","If you feel unwell,"
"1","8","161","00:21:25:14","00:21:27:08","visit Sejukwon in Songrim."
"1","8","162","00:21:27:10","00:21:28:23","Do you know Sejukwon?"
"1","8","163","00:21:29:00","00:21:30:18","I am Sejukwon's…"
"1","8","164","00:21:34:21","00:21:36:14","Heo Yun-ok."
"1","8","165","00:21:55:22","00:21:58:24","Seeing that you have it
instead of your friend,"
"1","8","166","00:22:00:05","00:22:02:02","I am guessing that friend is gone."
"1","8","167","00:22:05:16","00:22:06:22","You knew…"
"1","8","168","00:22:08:23","00:22:10:11","who I was all along."
"1","8","169","00:23:11:18","00:23:12:24","Are you all right?"
"1","8","170","00:23:13:01","00:23:14:19","Hey, are you all right?"
"1","8","171","00:23:14:21","00:23:17:17","Try getting up. Slowly."
"1","8","172","00:23:21:06","00:23:22:20","It is a monster!"
"1","8","173","00:23:24:22","00:23:25:23","A soul shifter."
"1","8","174","00:23:26:00","00:23:27:02","It is a soul shifter!"
"1","8","175","00:23:27:04","00:23:29:11","-A soul shifter!
-A soul shifter!"
"1","8","176","00:24:02:16","00:24:05:10","The real Danju is someone else."
"1","8","177","00:24:06:11","00:24:10:03","The true Danju
can prevent you from running wild."
"1","8","178","00:24:10:04","00:24:12:23","Go on. Go to your Danju."
"1","8","179","00:24:15:06","00:24:16:20","Gil-ju went missing?"
"1","8","180","00:24:16:22","00:24:20:16","We have not heard from him
ever since he went after Jang Uk's maid."
"1","8","181","00:24:22:05","00:24:23:20","Jang Uk's maid?"
"1","8","182","00:24:24:10","00:24:26:04","Why would he go after her?"
"1","8","183","00:24:26:06","00:24:29:23","To be honest,
he had been after Jang Uk all along."
"1","8","184","00:24:30:24","00:24:34:16","The Spirit Plaque Naksu had left
was actually Jang Uk's."
"1","8","185","00:24:35:10","00:24:38:14","He must have been after Jang Uk,
thinking he was involved."
"1","8","186","00:24:38:16","00:24:40:22","Then you should have told me sooner!"
"1","8","187","00:24:41:13","00:24:42:19","He told me to stay silent."
"1","8","188","00:24:42:21","00:24:45:03","He must have wanted
to find firm evidence first."
"1","8","189","00:24:45:19","00:24:47:22","Order all of our mages to look for Gil-ju."
"1","8","190","00:24:54:03","00:24:55:20","Uk's binding bracelet was found"
"1","8","191","00:24:55:22","00:24:58:09","in the spot where
the alchemy of souls had taken place?"
"1","8","192","00:24:58:11","00:24:59:23","Dang-gu is looking for Young Master Jang."
"1","8","193","00:25:00:01","00:25:02:02","Young Master Seo is searching
the area around the temple."
"1","8","194","00:25:02:04","00:25:04:19","-They were at the temple?
-Yes, my lord."
"1","8","195","00:25:04:21","00:25:08:22","I doubt Uk was capable
of carrying out the alchemy of souls."
"1","8","196","00:25:09:00","00:25:10:08","Master Lee,"
"1","8","197","00:25:10:10","00:25:12:23","what if someone else's soul
has shifted into Uk's body?"
"1","8","198","00:25:13:00","00:25:15:19","Do not worry. I am sure he is fine."
"1","8","199","00:25:20:09","00:25:22:14","She will protect him."
"1","8","200","00:25:22:16","00:25:23:20","By the way,"
"1","8","201","00:25:23:22","00:25:27:15","where is our leader among all this chaos?"
"1","8","202","00:25:28:13","00:25:30:05","Before Uk was born…"
"1","8","203","00:25:31:24","00:25:34:00","About 20 years ago…"
"1","8","204","00:25:34:15","00:25:35:15","Did Jang Gang"
"1","8","205","00:25:36:12","00:25:38:08","perform the alchemy of souls?"
"1","8","206","00:25:43:14","00:25:45:21","The Gwanju of Cheonbugwan
performing sorcery?"
"1","8","207","00:25:46:16","00:25:48:00","That is absurd."
"1","8","208","00:25:48:02","00:25:49:07","Jin Mu told me about it."
"1","8","209","00:25:50:23","00:25:52:24","I could not dare to hear from him,"
"1","8","210","00:25:54:09","00:25:55:24","so I came to you instead."
"1","8","211","00:26:00:10","00:26:01:20","Madam Do-hwa…"
"1","8","212","00:26:03:01","00:26:04:19","was indeed once concerned"
"1","8","213","00:26:05:19","00:26:08:17","that the Gwanju was interested
in learning a strange spell."
"1","8","214","00:26:09:13","00:26:12:20","However, it did not last long."
"1","8","215","00:26:13:10","00:26:15:16","He did not come home for a year."
"1","8","216","00:26:16:07","00:26:19:20","He practiced spells with Jin Mu
in the Cheonbugwan Secret Room."
"1","8","217","00:26:19:22","00:26:20:21","However,"
"1","8","218","00:26:20:23","00:26:24:18","he stopped doing so
after his wife became pregnant."
"1","8","219","00:26:28:16","00:26:32:13","Do-hwa gave birth to the late king's son."
"1","8","220","00:26:33:05","00:26:34:07","The late king"
"1","8","221","00:26:35:02","00:26:37:20","passed due to a severe illness
and could not even move."
"1","8","222","00:26:37:22","00:26:39:06","So how is that possible?"
"1","8","223","00:26:41:05","00:26:44:17","The alchemy of souls
would have made that possible."
"1","8","224","00:26:46:16","00:26:48:00","As a mage,"
"1","8","225","00:26:49:08","00:26:51:13","he was just briefly curious about it."
"1","8","226","00:26:51:15","00:26:52:13","No."
"1","8","227","00:26:53:21","00:26:55:04","He committed something"
"1","8","228","00:26:56:16","00:26:57:22","irreparable…"
"1","8","229","00:26:58:17","00:27:02:17","to Do-hwa and Uk."
"1","8","230","00:27:13:00","00:27:16:09","A mage of Jeongjingak
is urgently looking for our young master."
"1","8","231","00:27:26:04","00:27:27:22","I did not know you were here as well."
"1","8","232","00:27:27:24","00:27:29:06","What is it?"
"1","8","233","00:27:30:11","00:27:31:16","I think Uk"
"1","8","234","00:27:32:12","00:27:34:07","fell victim to the alchemy of souls."
"1","8","235","00:27:35:09","00:27:36:11","What?"
"1","8","236","00:28:00:21","00:28:02:05","That is Cheonbugwan."
"1","8","237","00:28:02:19","00:28:05:18","Could the real Danju
be inside those walls?"
"1","8","238","00:28:28:22","00:28:31:12","This is the way to the royal palace."
"1","8","239","00:28:32:08","00:28:35:04","Could the real Danju be in there?"
"1","8","240","00:28:44:24","00:28:46:03","I am from Cheonbugwan."
"1","8","241","00:28:46:21","00:28:48:15","It must be urgent."
"1","8","242","00:28:56:19","00:28:58:00","Let me see your face."
"1","8","243","00:28:58:02","00:29:00:00","This is urgent. Move aside."
"1","8","244","00:29:00:02","00:29:01:10","Let me see your face."
"1","8","245","00:29:23:23","00:29:24:24","A soul shifter."
"1","8","246","00:29:27:23","00:29:29:01","Go after him!"
"1","8","247","00:31:16:17","00:31:18:19","So the real Danju is inside the palace."
"1","8","248","00:31:21:10","00:31:22:19","The ice stone, was it?"
"1","8","249","00:31:23:23","00:31:25:11","You mentioned it."
"1","8","250","00:31:27:03","00:31:30:06","I will find that and prevent her
from meeting the same fate as you."
"1","8","251","00:32:01:12","00:32:02:23","Hold on. Is he really…"
"1","8","252","00:32:03:22","00:32:05:06","Look at him!"
"1","8","253","00:32:05:08","00:32:06:22","Is he really dead?"
"1","8","254","00:32:06:24","00:32:08:18","-Touch him.
-Should I?"
"1","8","255","00:32:08:21","00:32:10:23","-Goodness!
-Goodness!"
"1","8","256","00:32:26:21","00:32:28:21","He tried to enter the palace
while running wild."
"1","8","257","00:32:30:18","00:32:31:23","Did you kill him?"
"1","8","258","00:32:32:24","00:32:34:11","How could we?"
"1","8","259","00:32:34:13","00:32:37:09","An unknown mage suddenly appeared
and used a spell on him."
"1","8","260","00:32:38:03","00:32:40:09","Which family was he from?
Did you see his face?"
"1","8","261","00:32:40:11","00:32:41:24","No, my lord.
It was covered with a blue cloth."
"1","8","262","00:32:42:02","00:32:44:18","However, I did see which spell he used."
"1","8","263","00:32:51:05","00:32:52:09","It was Tansu."
"1","8","264","00:32:55:21","00:32:58:18","-Tansu?
-Yes, I am sure of it."
"1","8","265","00:32:59:21","00:33:01:10","He flicked energy with his sword."
"1","8","266","00:33:04:02","00:33:07:04","Tansu was the spell Naksu used."
"1","8","267","00:33:07:06","00:33:10:06","Was there another mage
who had mastered it?"
"1","8","268","00:33:19:08","00:33:21:19","I heard you caught
a soul shifter who had run wild."
"1","8","269","00:33:22:11","00:33:25:18","We came here to see who it was."
"1","8","270","00:33:27:01","00:33:29:24","Sure. Feel free to take a look at him."
"1","8","271","00:33:53:21","00:33:54:24","Is he not Gil-ju,"
"1","8","272","00:33:55:21","00:33:58:16","one of your men?"
"1","8","273","00:34:00:14","00:34:02:18","That is correct."
"1","8","274","00:34:05:05","00:34:07:20","Bring his body inside
and make everyone leave."
"1","8","275","00:34:07:23","00:34:08:20","Yes, my lord."
"1","8","276","00:34:14:10","00:34:17:14","Jin Mu was with me
when the alchemy of souls took place."
"1","8","277","00:34:18:10","00:34:20:00","He is panicking as well."
"1","8","278","00:34:21:00","00:34:24:11","He was not aware
of this alchemy of souls either."
"1","8","279","00:34:26:04","00:34:29:14","I will take care of this
since it occurred inside Cheonbugwan."
"1","8","280","00:34:29:16","00:34:31:09","It has nothing to do with Songrim."
"1","8","281","00:34:32:01","00:34:33:03","Sure."
"1","8","282","00:34:33:22","00:34:36:21","However, please ask us for help"
"1","8","283","00:34:37:11","00:34:39:19","if you ever need any."
"1","8","284","00:34:42:09","00:34:44:20","Another soul shifter had run wild?"
"1","8","285","00:34:45:10","00:34:48:13","Fortunately, he was caught
and died of petrification."
"1","8","286","00:34:48:15","00:34:50:15","And who was this soul shifter?"
"1","8","287","00:34:50:17","00:34:51:23","It was"
"1","8","288","00:34:52:00","00:34:55:05","Gil-ju, a mage of Cheonbugwan."
"1","8","289","00:34:57:01","00:34:59:04","Gil-ju had become a soul shifter?"
"1","8","290","00:35:00:04","00:35:03:06","Then was he caught in Cheonbugwan?"
"1","8","291","00:35:03:08","00:35:05:08","He was caught in front of the palace."
"1","8","292","00:35:05:10","00:35:08:11","He tried to enter the premises
after running wild."
"1","8","293","00:35:09:11","00:35:11:03","He was on his way here?"
"1","8","294","00:35:11:05","00:35:13:10","Then a mage suddenly appeared"
"1","8","295","00:35:13:12","00:35:15:15","and subdued him by using Tansu."
"1","8","296","00:35:18:23","00:35:20:24","And who was this mage?"
"1","8","297","00:35:22:13","00:35:24:16","Naksu was the one who killed Gil-ju."
"1","8","298","00:35:24:18","00:35:25:24","-What?
-Naksu?"
"1","8","299","00:35:26:02","00:35:27:12","She is back!"
"1","8","300","00:35:27:14","00:35:29:11","-Naksu?
-The assassin?"
"1","8","301","00:35:30:00","00:35:34:01","Last night, the mage who appeared
in front of the palace used Tansu."
"1","8","302","00:35:34:03","00:35:35:23","That was the spell Naksu used."
"1","8","303","00:35:36:00","00:35:37:17","-Goodness.
-Really?"
"1","8","304","00:35:37:20","00:35:39:04","-It was hers?
-My gosh."
"1","8","305","00:35:39:06","00:35:40:14","Hold on!"
"1","8","306","00:35:40:15","00:35:41:24","Naksu is dead."
"1","8","307","00:35:42:01","00:35:42:23","-Right.
-Right."
"1","8","308","00:35:43:00","00:35:45:23","Everyone here witnessed
her body turn to ash."
"1","8","309","00:35:46:00","00:35:48:08","I saw it with my own two eyes."
"1","8","310","00:35:48:10","00:35:49:15","-That is right.
-True."
"1","8","311","00:35:49:17","00:35:52:02","Unlike her body, her soul is still alive."
"1","8","312","00:35:52:04","00:35:55:14","The Shadow Assassin
has returned as a soul shifter!"
"1","8","313","00:35:55:16","00:35:57:08","-What?
-Is that true?"
"1","8","314","00:35:57:10","00:35:59:07","-That cannot be.
-Really?"
"1","8","315","00:35:59:10","00:36:01:06","But Naksu is female."
"1","8","316","00:36:01:09","00:36:03:10","It was a man who killed Gil-ju."
"1","8","317","00:36:03:12","00:36:06:16","He was a tall, young man
with a blue cloth covering his face."
"1","8","318","00:36:07:08","00:36:09:08","Naksu shifted souls, right?"
"1","8","319","00:36:09:10","00:36:12:02","She must have shifted souls
with that tall man."
"1","8","320","00:36:13:22","00:36:15:20","Then she must have become stronger."
"1","8","321","00:36:17:07","00:36:18:24","She was powerful to begin with."
"1","8","322","00:36:19:01","00:36:22:12","But she has become invincible
thanks to shifting into a strong body."
"1","8","323","00:36:24:18","00:36:26:03","Murdering Gil-ju is her revenge"
"1","8","324","00:36:26:05","00:36:28:17","on Cheonbugwan for burning her body"
"1","8","325","00:36:29:08","00:36:30:21","and killing her men."
"1","8","326","00:36:30:23","00:36:32:08","Why us?"
"1","8","327","00:36:32:11","00:36:34:08","Songrim was the one who killed Naksu."
"1","8","328","00:36:35:07","00:36:40:01","""The invincible Naksu
dressed in blue cloth has returned,"
"1","8","329","00:36:40:03","00:36:42:18","and Songrim is her next target."""
"1","8","330","00:36:42:20","00:36:45:24","This is the rumor
that I have been hearing."
"1","8","331","00:36:46:01","00:36:48:23","The soul shifter was caught
only a few hours ago."
"1","8","332","00:36:49:01","00:36:50:20","How is it we already have
such absurd rumors?"
"1","8","333","00:36:51:10","00:36:55:05","Such rumors tend to spread
like wildfire and be exaggerated."
"1","8","334","00:36:55:07","00:36:56:23","And the rumor is reasonable."
"1","8","335","00:36:57:01","00:37:00:00","The mage who killed Gil-ju used Tansu,"
"1","8","336","00:37:00:02","00:37:02:11","and that is exactly the spell Naksu used."
"1","8","337","00:37:02:13","00:37:04:11","Who said she was the only one
who could use it?"
"1","8","338","00:37:06:01","00:37:08:19","I could master it
right now if I wanted to."
"1","8","339","00:37:10:14","00:37:13:06","If this rumor spreads within Songrim,"
"1","8","340","00:37:13:08","00:37:16:10","I will hold you responsible.
So make sure that never happens."
"1","8","341","00:37:17:05","00:37:18:06","Yes, my lord."
"1","8","342","00:37:21:16","00:37:24:16","I am truly relieved
that it was not Young Master Jang"
"1","8","343","00:37:24:18","00:37:26:04","who had shifted souls and died."
"1","8","344","00:37:27:01","00:37:30:07","But then why did we find
his belongings there?"
"1","8","345","00:37:31:23","00:37:34:04","We will know once we find him."
"1","8","346","00:37:40:05","00:37:42:18","You do not look too well."
"1","8","347","00:37:50:01","00:37:51:09","You should"
"1","8","348","00:37:52:03","00:37:54:12","go home and wait for him there."
"1","8","349","00:38:04:20","00:38:06:13","Are you feeling very unwell?"
"1","8","350","00:38:07:03","00:38:10:04","I was so surprised
that the honey biscuit I had last night"
"1","8","351","00:38:10:07","00:38:12:07","is giving me indigestion."
"1","8","352","00:38:14:08","00:38:17:07","I was so shocked
when I heard about his soul shifting"
"1","8","353","00:38:17:09","00:38:19:17","that even my soul exited
and entered my body again."
"1","8","354","00:38:27:21","00:38:30:06","Is it really back?"
"1","8","355","00:38:33:04","00:38:34:12","Is that you, Maidservant Kim?"
"1","8","356","00:38:35:08","00:38:37:21","No, my lord. I am Maidservant Park."
"1","8","357","00:38:39:01","00:38:42:17","If I could, I would like to slap
Young Master Park's back for shocking me."
"1","8","358","00:38:44:19","00:38:46:04","Slap mine instead."
"1","8","359","00:38:48:14","00:38:51:03","I can allow that for Maidservant Park."
"1","8","360","00:38:51:18","00:38:52:20","Go on."
"1","8","361","00:38:52:22","00:38:54:16","I have pretty strong hands."
"1","8","362","00:38:54:18","00:38:56:17","It will hurt."
"1","8","363","00:38:57:14","00:38:59:19","I will not be a baby about it,"
"1","8","364","00:38:59:21","00:39:01:04","so go on."
"1","8","365","00:39:01:18","00:39:02:21","Goodness."
"1","8","366","00:39:04:20","00:39:07:17","This means you have already hit me once."
"1","8","367","00:39:09:01","00:39:10:08","Why?"
"1","8","368","00:39:11:01","00:39:13:04","Are you going to do something
to make me upset?"
"1","8","369","00:39:13:06","00:39:15:19","Then take it back."
"1","8","370","00:39:15:21","00:39:17:04","Hit me back."
"1","8","371","00:39:18:00","00:39:19:03","Go on."
"1","8","372","00:39:20:02","00:39:21:14","Hurry up."
"1","8","373","00:39:27:05","00:39:28:11","I do not want…"
"1","8","374","00:39:30:05","00:39:31:21","to hurt you."
"1","8","375","00:39:34:06","00:39:36:05","As Songrim's leader,"
"1","8","376","00:39:37:11","00:39:40:10","there will come a time
when I will have to be cold and heartless."
"1","8","377","00:39:41:02","00:39:42:10","But I truly"
"1","8","378","00:39:43:13","00:39:45:05","do not want to hurt you."
"1","8","379","00:39:50:22","00:39:52:05","Is your heart troubled"
"1","8","380","00:39:52:19","00:39:56:05","because of what you asked me yesterday
regarding Master Jang Gang?"
"1","8","381","00:39:56:20","00:39:58:19","There has been chaos lately."
"1","8","382","00:39:58:21","00:40:00:21","But I have failed to be objective"
"1","8","383","00:40:01:21","00:40:03:20","as the leader."
"1","8","384","00:40:04:19","00:40:06:22","Your slap helped me come to my senses."
"1","8","385","00:40:07:18","00:40:10:23","I must act wisely from now on."
"1","8","386","00:40:15:03","00:40:17:01","Feel free to hit me every now and then"
"1","8","387","00:40:18:09","00:40:19:24","as Maidservant Park."
"1","8","388","00:40:21:21","00:40:23:01","If it is you,"
"1","8","389","00:40:24:01","00:40:25:15","I can allow that."
"1","8","390","00:40:41:20","00:40:43:03","Why are you here?"
"1","8","391","00:40:43:05","00:40:45:19","Master Heo ordered me
to trace the root of the sorcery."
"1","8","392","00:40:45:21","00:40:48:03","And this is what I found here."
"1","8","393","00:40:49:03","00:40:51:06","I must have left it behind."
"1","8","394","00:40:52:17","00:40:54:05","Do you not need it anymore?"
"1","8","395","00:40:55:07","00:40:57:01","No, I am fine now."
"1","8","396","00:40:57:19","00:41:00:06","I almost lost that Jin family treasure."
"1","8","397","00:41:01:08","00:41:02:14","Thank you for finding it."
"1","8","398","00:41:04:00","00:41:05:17","You also left something else."
"1","8","399","00:41:07:00","00:41:08:20","Are you not looking for Mu-deok?"
"1","8","400","00:41:10:22","00:41:11:23","Where is she?"
"1","8","401","00:41:13:16","00:41:15:07","I found her hiding in the forest."
"1","8","402","00:41:16:19","00:41:19:17","She was injured and bleeding profusely."
"1","8","403","00:41:34:24","00:41:35:22","Mu-deok."
"1","8","404","00:41:37:15","00:41:38:19","Young Master."
"1","8","405","00:41:39:08","00:41:41:19","How could you leave me behind?"
"1","8","406","00:41:41:21","00:41:42:22","What?"
"1","8","407","00:41:44:15","00:41:48:02","You ran away and left me behind."
"1","8","408","00:41:48:23","00:41:50:10","Go along with it."
"1","8","409","00:41:54:03","00:41:57:05","Right. I did indeed run away."
"1","8","410","00:41:57:20","00:41:58:19","That is right."
"1","8","411","00:41:58:21","00:42:02:03","We had spotted the soul shifter
when we took shelter from the rain."
"1","8","412","00:42:02:05","00:42:03:12","But thanks to you,"
"1","8","413","00:42:03:15","00:42:06:22","I almost got ripped into shreds
by that soul shifter."
"1","8","414","00:42:09:10","00:42:10:11","I am sorry."
"1","8","415","00:42:12:00","00:42:15:18","I was too terrified
that I did not think twice and ran away."
"1","8","416","00:42:17:08","00:42:20:17","Yul mistook Mu-deok for the soul shifter
and almost killed her."
"1","8","417","00:42:21:09","00:42:24:10","Had he not treated her right away,
she would have died."
"1","8","418","00:42:29:24","00:42:31:10","Yul."
"1","8","419","00:42:31:12","00:42:35:10","Thanks for rescuing and treating Mu-deok."
"1","8","420","00:42:41:07","00:42:43:02","Did you really run away
and leave her behind?"
"1","8","421","00:42:48:22","00:42:50:18","Had I fought, I would have died."
"1","8","422","00:42:51:09","00:42:52:20","We need to be selfish at times."
"1","8","423","00:42:54:08","00:42:56:10","Why are you staring at me?
Do you not agree?"
"1","8","424","00:42:57:19","00:43:00:01","In any case, I am glad"
"1","8","425","00:43:00:02","00:43:02:20","that both of us are fine."
"1","8","426","00:43:12:10","00:43:13:06","Right."
"1","8","427","00:43:19:13","00:43:21:09","I heard you are hiding in Danhyanggok."
"1","8","428","00:43:21:24","00:43:23:21","Did you hear that our leader made Songrim"
"1","8","429","00:43:23:23","00:43:26:01","take responsibility
for the dishonor you made?"
"1","8","430","00:43:26:03","00:43:27:16","Jeez, I am sick of this."
"1","8","431","00:43:28:09","00:43:30:20","Why would he do that
when I am not from Songrim?"
"1","8","432","00:43:30:22","00:43:33:00","The duel with the Crown Prince
is in two weeks."
"1","8","433","00:43:33:16","00:43:37:06","Do not enter the fortress
or cause any more trouble until then."
"1","8","434","00:43:37:08","00:43:38:13","Just lie low."
"1","8","435","00:43:44:13","00:43:46:19","Thank you for treating me."
"1","8","436","00:43:46:21","00:43:48:24","Uk seems fine
without the binding bracelet."
"1","8","437","00:43:50:01","00:43:52:06","I guess he can control his energy now."
"1","8","438","00:43:54:13","00:43:57:10","He risked his life
and got what he wanted once again."
"1","8","439","00:43:57:12","00:43:59:00","And you were by his side again."
"1","8","440","00:44:01:20","00:44:05:14","If you were so bothered by that
you should have just let me die."
"1","8","441","00:44:06:05","00:44:07:08","Next time,"
"1","8","442","00:44:09:02","00:44:10:12","I might have to do just that."
"1","8","443","00:44:17:09","00:44:18:14","Mu-deok."
"1","8","444","00:44:19:16","00:44:20:22","Coming, Young Master."
"1","8","445","00:44:23:16","00:44:24:17","Bye."
"1","8","446","00:44:30:14","00:44:32:15","Uk was unscathed."
"1","8","447","00:44:33:13","00:44:34:11","That is a relief."
"1","8","448","00:44:35:09","00:44:37:07","Did he see"
"1","8","449","00:44:37:09","00:44:39:22","who was with Gil-ju
when the latter shifted souls?"
"1","8","450","00:44:39:24","00:44:42:22","That person was probably
the one in the blue cloth."
"1","8","451","00:44:42:24","00:44:45:09","He was too busy running away to look back."
"1","8","452","00:44:45:11","00:44:47:04","Did you ask his maid?"
"1","8","453","00:44:48:15","00:44:50:08","She must have witnessed the spell."
"1","8","454","00:44:53:08","00:44:54:15","Mu-deok…"
"1","8","455","00:45:00:15","00:45:02:19","She probably will not know
even if she saw it."
"1","8","456","00:45:03:24","00:45:06:18","She is an ordinary maid
who does not know such spells."
"1","8","457","00:45:09:10","00:45:11:14","What happened to your hand?"
"1","8","458","00:45:13:08","00:45:14:04","Did you injure it?"
"1","8","459","00:45:16:17","00:45:19:19","The Soul Ejector I had touched yesterday
had some leftover poison from the sorcery."
"1","8","460","00:45:20:14","00:45:21:17","But I am fine."
"1","8","461","00:45:23:08","00:45:24:17","I shall take my leave."
"1","8","462","00:46:02:21","00:46:04:17","Why did you want to see me this time?"
"1","8","463","00:46:06:13","00:46:10:19","I heard you had taken
my wedding gifts that had arrived."
"1","8","464","00:46:11:09","00:46:12:18","Why did you do that?"
"1","8","465","00:46:12:20","00:46:15:23","Were you worried I would destroy them?"
"1","8","466","00:46:16:00","00:46:20:00","I will keep them stored and give them back
during your next wedding."
"1","8","467","00:46:20:14","00:46:21:24","Just throw them away."
"1","8","468","00:46:22:01","00:46:24:10","Marriage is out of the picture for me."
"1","8","469","00:46:25:10","00:46:27:13","Do not be so embarrassed."
"1","8","470","00:46:27:15","00:46:32:02","Your wedding was prepared in secret,
so not many know of it."
"1","8","471","00:46:34:04","00:46:35:03","Really?"
"1","8","472","00:46:37:09","00:46:39:12","Cho-yeon!"
"1","8","473","00:46:43:03","00:46:44:22","I heard you are getting married."
"1","8","474","00:46:45:16","00:46:48:20","I heard you bought gifts
and hired a craftsman for your rings."
"1","8","475","00:46:49:08","00:46:52:02","I guess word got out."
"1","8","476","00:46:52:04","00:46:53:02","Congratulations."
"1","8","477","00:46:53:04","00:46:55:10","Congratulations, Young Master Park."
"1","8","478","00:46:56:02","00:46:58:19","-Me?
-I know you two are getting married."
"1","8","479","00:46:58:21","00:47:00:17","He received the wedding gifts"
"1","8","480","00:47:00:19","00:47:02:15","and went with you to get your rings."
"1","8","481","00:47:02:17","00:47:03:20","Right?"
"1","8","482","00:47:03:22","00:47:06:18","There was an absurd rumor
about you marrying Uk again."
"1","8","483","00:47:07:08","00:47:08:07","No, right?"
"1","8","484","00:47:08:09","00:47:10:00","You are marrying Young Master Park, right?"
"1","8","485","00:47:11:17","00:47:12:18","That is true."
"1","8","486","00:47:12:20","00:47:14:18","But please keep it quiet"
"1","8","487","00:47:14:20","00:47:16:06","since it is a secret."
"1","8","488","00:47:16:21","00:47:17:24","All right."
"1","8","489","00:47:18:15","00:47:19:19","See you later."
"1","8","490","00:47:21:01","00:47:23:10","I told you it was Dang-gu."
"1","8","491","00:47:23:12","00:47:26:14","You are right.
She would be crazy to wed Uk again."
"1","8","492","00:47:26:16","00:47:28:06","Tell me about it."
"1","8","493","00:47:30:23","00:47:32:00","Young Master Park."
"1","8","494","00:47:32:02","00:47:33:22","Why did you say yes?"
"1","8","495","00:47:34:11","00:47:36:19","This is better
than getting rejected by Uk twice."
"1","8","496","00:47:37:09","00:47:40:04","Let us say
you broke it off with me this time."
"1","8","497","00:47:40:06","00:47:42:01","After all, it will just be a rumor."
"1","8","498","00:47:43:17","00:47:45:24","Will you be all right with that?"
"1","8","499","00:47:46:23","00:47:48:12","You will be embarrassed."
"1","8","500","00:47:49:18","00:47:50:23","That is fine by me."
"1","8","501","00:48:18:23","00:48:19:22","Filthy Mu-deok?"
"1","8","502","00:48:21:12","00:48:23:23","Are you back here again?
Were you unharmed?"
"1","8","503","00:48:24:23","00:48:25:23","Sorry?"
"1","8","504","00:48:28:21","00:48:30:10","Forget it. Move aside."
"1","8","505","00:48:35:13","00:48:37:17","Are you looking for Mu-deok again?"
"1","8","506","00:48:37:19","00:48:40:13","Never mind.
Her dress just looked familiar."
"1","8","507","00:48:41:21","00:48:44:08","Mu-deok sold it to us."
"1","8","508","00:48:45:02","00:48:47:02","-She sold it?
-Yes, Your Royal Highness."
"1","8","509","00:48:47:04","00:48:50:02","She said a thoughtless, young man
had given it to her."
"1","8","510","00:48:50:04","00:48:51:14","She sold it saying"
"1","8","511","00:48:51:16","00:48:53:15","that he was well-off
and would not want it back."
"1","8","512","00:48:55:06","00:48:57:22","Did she really say that?"
"1","8","513","00:48:57:24","00:49:01:19","That is right. Filthy Mu-deok and silk
do not go hand in hand."
"1","8","514","00:49:02:18","00:49:03:24","Watch what you say."
"1","8","515","00:49:04:18","00:49:05:15","Sorry?"
"1","8","516","00:49:05:17","00:49:09:01","That is a nickname that I have given her.
Only I can call her that."
"1","8","517","00:49:09:03","00:49:10:07","So do not call her that."
"1","8","518","00:49:11:05","00:49:12:06","I am sorry, Your Royal Highness."
"1","8","519","00:49:13:24","00:49:15:02","Also…"
"1","8","520","00:49:17:04","00:49:19:11","she did not look too bad
in that silk dress."
"1","8","521","00:49:20:04","00:49:22:13","She looked much better
than you in that blue cloth."
"1","8","522","00:49:23:03","00:49:24:19","You must not like this."
"1","8","523","00:49:26:09","00:49:27:15","What is that?"
"1","8","524","00:49:27:17","00:49:30:08","Everyone here was wearing one."
"1","8","525","00:49:30:10","00:49:32:11","This is Naksu's cloth."
"1","8","526","00:49:32:13","00:49:33:15","Whose cloth?"
"1","8","527","00:49:33:16","00:49:37:01","Naksu, the soul shifter, killed a mage
of Cheonbugwan in front of the palace."
"1","8","528","00:49:37:16","00:49:39:20","Naksu had a blue cloth like this one."
"1","8","529","00:49:39:22","00:49:43:13","This blue cloth has become
a trend within the capital's walls."
"1","8","530","00:49:49:01","00:49:52:07","-Come and buy Naksu's blue cloth.
-I got one."
"1","8","531","00:49:52:10","00:49:54:03","It will prevent your soul
from getting shifted."
"1","8","532","00:49:54:06","00:49:55:16","-This one.
-Take it."
"1","8","533","00:49:55:18","00:49:58:04","I would like one too."
"1","8","534","00:49:58:06","00:50:00:11","-This is Naksu's cloth.
-Try this on."
"1","8","535","00:50:05:03","00:50:07:05","Naksu, the soul shifter in blue?"
"1","8","536","00:50:08:08","00:50:10:14","Everyone thinks Naksu
has returned from the dead."
"1","8","537","00:50:12:07","00:50:16:03","But thanks to Naksu in Blue,"
"1","8","538","00:50:16:05","00:50:18:22","they have lost interest
in Uk's duel with the Crown Prince."
"1","8","539","00:50:20:01","00:50:22:00","I wonder where Uk and Mu-deok are."
"1","8","540","00:50:23:03","00:50:24:12","They were not in Danhyanggok either."
"1","8","541","00:50:25:09","00:50:26:21","I am sure they are safe."
"1","8","542","00:50:27:14","00:50:30:04","They will return after two weeks."
"1","8","543","00:50:32:16","00:50:34:07","By the way, Yul…"
"1","8","544","00:50:36:21","00:50:38:14","I got one too. Do you want to try it on?"
"1","8","545","00:50:44:07","00:50:45:06","All right."
"1","8","546","00:50:49:20","00:50:52:09","Who in the world could it be?"
"1","8","547","00:50:52:11","00:50:55:15","This Naksu in blue cloth who uses Tansu?"
"1","8","548","00:51:03:16","00:51:05:19","Did you say
this was the soul shifters' grave?"
"1","8","549","00:51:07:08","00:51:08:23","Then he must be buried here."
"1","8","550","00:51:10:20","00:51:11:23","Your father."
"1","8","551","00:51:13:22","00:51:15:12","As a little girl,"
"1","8","552","00:51:16:00","00:51:19:19","I thought he was unjustly murdered
by the mages of the four families."
"1","8","553","00:51:21:12","00:51:24:02","Jin Mu took me under his wing,
and I called him Danju."
"1","8","554","00:51:24:05","00:51:25:06","However…"
"1","8","555","00:51:26:21","00:51:29:09","my father was a soul shifter
who used sorcery."
"1","8","556","00:51:31:02","00:51:33:09","And I was used and abandoned."
"1","8","557","00:51:36:24","00:51:38:12","Like Gil-ju said,"
"1","8","558","00:51:39:15","00:51:41:09","I will eventually run wild as well."
"1","8","559","00:51:46:05","00:51:47:16","Once I become petrified,"
"1","8","560","00:51:52:01","00:51:53:18","will you leave me here?"
"1","8","561","00:52:05:06","00:52:09:08","I found out where the real Danju was."
"1","8","562","00:52:11:00","00:52:14:01","Inside the palace.
The true Danju is in there."
"1","8","563","00:52:18:12","00:52:21:09","Please tell me about the ice stone."
"1","8","564","00:52:23:01","00:52:24:08","Are you certain"
"1","8","565","00:52:24:23","00:52:28:04","that the ice stone was indeed destroyed"
"1","8","566","00:52:29:14","00:52:33:07","by Master Seo Gyeong
and the leader of Jinyowon 200 years ago?"
"1","8","567","00:52:36:01","00:52:37:16","Are you sure…"
"1","8","568","00:52:39:05","00:52:40:17","it is not somewhere in Songrim?"
"1","8","569","00:53:01:22","00:53:03:20","Hello, Danju."
"1","8","570","00:53:20:02","00:53:23:19","Gil-ju wanted the ice stone
and headed to the palace to see me."
"1","8","571","00:53:24:23","00:53:26:03","I was not aware"
"1","8","572","00:53:27:01","00:53:29:14","that Gil-ju knew who the real Danju was."
"1","8","573","00:53:30:07","00:53:32:05","The day the Choi family regains power,"
"1","8","574","00:53:32:20","00:53:36:19","Songrim, the cause
of our family's downfall, gets destroyed,"
"1","8","575","00:53:38:18","00:53:41:24","and I control Daeho, is approaching."
"1","8","576","00:53:43:18","00:53:46:06","And I have been waiting
for that day with bated breath."
"1","8","577","00:53:47:17","00:53:51:02","We must find and kill the one
who killed Gil-ju in front of the palace."
"1","8","578","00:53:52:15","00:53:55:01","That individual may have waited
for Gil-ju to go there,"
"1","8","579","00:53:55:03","00:53:57:22","knowing the latter
was after the ice stone."
"1","8","580","00:53:57:24","00:54:00:14","If that individual knows
that the ice stone is in there,"
"1","8","581","00:54:01:01","00:54:02:11","you must find"
"1","8","582","00:54:03:14","00:54:04:21","and kill them."
"1","8","583","00:54:09:11","00:54:10:22","I do not know who it is,"
"1","8","584","00:54:11:23","00:54:13:22","but the Danju inside the palace
has the ice stone."
"1","8","585","00:54:14:00","00:54:16:17","And with that, Gil-ju said
a soul shifter may not run wild."
"1","8","586","00:54:18:19","00:54:22:01","Are you saying we should enter
the royal palace and look for the Danju?"
"1","8","587","00:54:22:03","00:54:24:03","It is impossible in my current state."
"1","8","588","00:54:24:23","00:54:27:09","I am a low-class mage
that was rejected by Jeongjingak."
"1","8","589","00:54:28:00","00:54:30:15","However, I will keep climbing up."
"1","8","590","00:54:31:18","00:54:34:05","And I will eventually enter
the palace walls."
"1","8","591","00:54:35:20","00:54:36:21","Master."
"1","8","592","00:54:38:02","00:54:39:08","I will find"
"1","8","593","00:54:40:10","00:54:41:19","that ice stone for you."
"1","8","594","00:54:47:07","00:54:48:08","Uk."
"1","8","595","00:54:49:05","00:54:51:13","Your master is neither strong enough
to pull you up"
"1","8","596","00:54:52:15","00:54:55:07","nor support you from the bottom."
"1","8","597","00:54:56:24","00:55:00:03","You were never like that to begin with."
"1","8","598","00:55:00:16","00:55:02:06","You always pushed me to my death."
"1","8","599","00:55:05:19","00:55:09:17","But whenever you did that,
I found myself on a whole new level."
"1","8","600","00:55:13:11","00:55:15:07","Keep doing that"
"1","8","601","00:55:15:22","00:55:17:12","and stay by my side."
"1","8","602","00:55:27:12","00:55:28:17","Fine."
"1","8","603","00:55:29:16","00:55:31:19","I will do that and push you"
"1","8","604","00:55:31:21","00:55:34:05","to your death if you stop."
"1","8","605","00:56:01:18","00:56:04:20","I will find Uk and make sure
he does not come to fight the duel."
"1","8","606","00:56:06:16","00:56:07:23","Do not bother."
"1","8","607","00:56:08:12","00:56:10:20","If he wants to come,"
"1","8","608","00:56:11:17","00:56:12:16","let him."
"1","8","609","00:56:12:18","00:56:15:10","It is a formal match among mages."
"1","8","610","00:56:16:04","00:56:18:09","We cannot intervene
even if one of them dies."
"1","8","611","00:56:20:12","00:56:22:06","If death occurs,"
"1","8","612","00:56:24:05","00:56:25:18","then that is that."
"1","8","613","00:56:30:03","00:56:31:16","Will you not stop it?"
"1","8","614","00:56:35:16","00:56:38:07","The Unanimous Assembly asked Uk to fight"
"1","8","615","00:56:38:09","00:56:40:12","on Songrim's behalf."
"1","8","616","00:56:41:09","00:56:43:07","Whether he becomes a coward and runs away"
"1","8","617","00:56:44:00","00:56:46:02","or honorably dies during the duel,"
"1","8","618","00:56:46:22","00:56:51:19","I will only watch
as the leader of Songrim."
"1","8","619","00:58:23:22","00:58:28:05","His Majesty and the Queen are here."
"1","8","620","00:59:01:07","00:59:04:01","One month ago, Go Won,
Daeho's royal Go family member,"
"1","8","621","00:59:04:04","00:59:07:17","challenged Jang Uk, the eldest son
of the Jang family, to a duel."
"1","8","622","00:59:07:19","00:59:11:08","And Songrim received
the challenge on Uk's behalf."
"1","8","623","00:59:12:03","00:59:14:04","Whoever signs the paper"
"1","8","624","00:59:14:06","00:59:16:11","cannot hold his opponent responsible"
"1","8","625","00:59:17:10","00:59:20:11","for their death even if that occurs."
"1","8","626","00:59:22:04","00:59:25:24","The match will commence at noon."
"1","8","627","00:59:26:16","00:59:28:18","If he does not show up by then,"
"1","8","628","00:59:29:13","00:59:31:13","we will accept his defeat."
"1","8","629","00:59:34:05","00:59:39:05","You must mention the punishment
he will get if he does not show up."
"1","8","630","00:59:42:13","00:59:47:03","If Jang Uk does not show up today,"
"1","8","631","00:59:47:22","00:59:52:00","his right to become
Cheonbugwan's next Gwanju…"
"1","8","632","00:59:53:23","00:59:55:08","will be lost."
"1","8","633","01:00:16:11","01:00:17:08","Come here."
"1","8","634","01:00:19:02","01:00:20:23","What are in those crocks?"
"1","8","635","01:00:22:18","01:00:24:10","They are full of water."
"1","8","636","01:00:24:24","01:00:26:13","Crocks full of water?"
"1","8","637","01:00:59:05","01:01:01:04","My lord, it is noon."
"1","8","638","01:01:01:07","01:01:03:06","Close the Training Center's door."
"1","8","639","01:01:04:11","01:01:05:15","I must announce"
"1","8","640","01:01:06:21","01:01:08:09","his defeat."
"1","8","641","01:01:28:10","01:01:29:08","Close the door."
"1","8","642","01:01:44:10","01:01:45:16","Jang Uk is here!"
"1","8","643","01:01:55:00","01:01:55:23","Young Master…"
"1","8","644","01:02:26:15","01:02:27:15","Young Master."
"1","8","645","01:02:29:05","01:02:30:05","It will be all right."
"1","8","646","01:02:34:18","01:02:37:02","JANG UK"
"1","8","647","01:02:57:09","01:02:59:08","Now that you have signed the paper,"
"1","8","648","01:02:59:11","01:03:00:23","no one can intervene"
"1","8","649","01:03:01:17","01:03:03:17","even if you die while fighting."
"1","8","650","01:03:04:22","01:03:06:01","I am aware of that."
"1","8","651","01:03:09:19","01:03:10:24","Mother."
"1","8","652","01:03:11:01","01:03:13:17","Please use our plaque to stop this duel."
"1","8","653","01:03:14:11","01:03:17:06","He will surely die
in the Crown Prince's hands."
"1","8","654","01:03:17:08","01:03:19:08","He showed up because he was ready to die."
"1","8","655","01:03:20:10","01:03:22:03","Your wedding has fallen through."
"1","8","656","01:03:22:05","01:03:24:24","His fate has nothing to do with us now."
"1","8","657","01:03:38:12","01:03:39:21","You may commence the duel."
"1","8","658","01:04:09:01","01:04:11:06","First, do not do anything and just defend."
"1","8","659","01:04:11:08","01:04:13:12","If you make the first move
with your current skills,"
"1","8","660","01:04:15:01","01:04:16:05","you will die."
"1","8","661","01:04:18:03","01:04:20:01","You must only attack him"
"1","8","662","01:04:21:05","01:04:22:20","when he loses his focus."
"1","8","663","01:05:00:21","01:05:02:20","I trust that he has placed them."
"1","8","664","01:05:02:22","01:05:05:15","Did you say you could enter Songrim
whenever you pleased?"
"1","8","665","01:05:06:16","01:05:07:20","Yes. Why?"
"1","8","666","01:05:08:21","01:05:10:10","I have a favor."
"1","8","667","01:05:10:24","01:05:12:20","Could you put some water
in the Training Center"
"1","8","668","01:05:12:22","01:05:14:24","so that he can use Tansu during the duel?"
"1","8","669","01:05:29:04","01:05:32:04","I feel uneasy about those crocks."
"1","8","670","01:05:33:22","01:05:34:21","Break them."
"1","8","671","01:06:34:16","01:06:35:17","Young Master."
"1","8","672","01:06:47:09","01:06:48:12","Tansu."
"1","8","673","01:07:06:10","01:07:07:09","Your Royal Highness."
"1","8","674","01:07:07:12","01:07:08:14","The match"
"1","8","675","01:07:09:02","01:07:10:06","has ended."
"1","8","676","01:07:15:08","01:07:17:16","This is cheating. It does not count!"
"1","8","677","01:07:27:12","01:07:29:01","That was Tansu."
"1","8","678","01:07:29:24","01:07:32:23","Only those
who have reached Chisu can do it."
"1","8","679","01:07:33:19","01:07:37:13","How could he have mastered that
when his gate of energy just opened?"
"1","8","680","01:07:37:15","01:07:38:24","I am certain"
"1","8","681","01:07:39:01","01:07:42:07","that a master has helped him in secret."
"1","8","682","01:07:42:09","01:07:45:13","How could anyone have possibly helped him"
"1","8","683","01:07:45:15","01:07:47:11","when all of us were watching?"
"1","8","684","01:07:47:13","01:07:48:24","Do not be stubborn!"
"1","8","685","01:07:49:15","01:07:51:14","Jang Uk, tell us yourself."
"1","8","686","01:07:51:16","01:07:54:05","Is it true that you have learned Tansu"
"1","8","687","01:07:54:06","01:07:55:24","by reaching Chisu in such a short time?"
"1","8","688","01:07:57:13","01:07:58:21","That is not true."
"1","8","689","01:07:59:19","01:08:01:19","I do not know how to gather my energy."
"1","8","690","01:08:01:21","01:08:04:02","I can only use Tansu if there is water."
"1","8","691","01:08:04:17","01:08:07:10","I only learned how to flick the water."
"1","8","692","01:08:07:12","01:08:09:19","Then who taught you that?"
"1","8","693","01:08:11:14","01:08:13:19","Someone must have taught you that skill."
"1","8","694","01:08:16:24","01:08:18:00","No one did."
"1","8","695","01:08:19:23","01:08:20:24","Look at him."
"1","8","696","01:08:21:17","01:08:23:03","He is being ridiculous,"
"1","8","697","01:08:23:05","01:08:25:19","claiming that
he learned it single-handedly."
"1","8","698","01:08:28:21","01:08:31:11","I spotted some water crocks
in this building."
"1","8","699","01:08:33:03","01:08:35:04","Who placed them here?"
"1","8","700","01:08:36:21","01:08:38:17","Was it your master?"
"1","8","701","01:08:40:14","01:08:42:00","I trained by myself."
"1","8","702","01:08:42:02","01:08:43:12","I will not buy that!"
"1","8","703","01:08:43:14","01:08:45:11","Jang Uk, explain yourself."
"1","8","704","01:08:48:22","01:08:52:00","Who helped you train all this time?"
"1","8","705","01:09:02:04","01:09:03:06","It was me."
"1","8","706","01:09:15:22","01:09:17:12","I was with him."
"1","8","707","01:09:18:06","01:09:21:11","Everything he just said is true."
"1","8","708","01:09:25:02","01:09:26:07","And who are you?"
"1","8","709","01:09:27:05","01:09:29:03","How dare you intervene?"
"1","8","710","01:09:29:05","01:09:30:07","Silence!"
"1","8","711","01:09:31:01","01:09:33:17","He is Hemp Master Lee,"
"1","8","712","01:09:33:19","01:09:35:12","a pupil of Master Seo Gyeong."
"1","8","713","01:09:35:14","01:09:37:10","Greet him this instant!"
"1","8","714","01:09:40:20","01:09:42:16","Goodness. Hello, master."
"1","8","715","01:09:45:11","01:09:48:22","I saw everything
during my time in Danhyanggok with him."
"1","8","716","01:09:48:24","01:09:51:17","He practiced flicking waterdrops
all day long."
"1","8","717","01:09:54:22","01:09:56:10","And by his side"
"1","8","718","01:09:57:23","01:10:00:08","was no one other than his maid."
"1","8","719","01:10:02:09","01:10:05:10","Master Lee has vouched for him."
"1","8","720","01:10:07:11","01:10:11:23","Do you have any other objections?"
"1","8","721","01:10:46:21","01:10:48:12","Let us go, Your Majesty."
"1","8","722","01:11:05:14","01:11:08:08","Bring Jang Uk into Cheonbugwan."
"1","8","723","01:11:21:12","01:11:24:22","The son of Gwanju Jang Gang
is incredible indeed."
"1","8","724","01:11:24:24","01:11:30:00","Since you do not have a master yet,
Cheonbugwan will happily accept you."
"1","8","725","01:11:30:20","01:11:32:17","Do not be ridiculous."
"1","8","726","01:11:32:19","01:11:35:02","If anything, I should be his master."
"1","8","727","01:11:35:05","01:11:38:08","I opened his gate of energy
and gave him a torrent of my energy."
"1","8","728","01:11:38:10","01:11:40:20","Uk, come to Sejukwon."
"1","8","729","01:11:40:23","01:11:43:05","I will teach you what I know."
"1","8","730","01:11:43:07","01:11:45:13","How about joining Jinyowon?"
"1","8","731","01:11:47:07","01:11:49:03","As Cho-yeon's former betrothed,"
"1","8","732","01:11:49:05","01:11:52:11","we will consider you family
and teach you our spells."
"1","8","733","01:11:56:23","01:11:58:03","Jang Uk."
"1","8","734","01:11:59:00","01:12:01:07","If you wish to join Songrim Jeongjingak,"
"1","8","735","01:12:02:24","01:12:04:06","we will accept you."
"1","8","736","01:12:23:11","01:12:24:14","Mu-deok."
"1","8","737","01:12:24:16","01:12:28:10","They all want me. Where should I go?"
"1","8","738","01:12:40:22","01:12:42:17","You should join Songrim for now,"
"1","8","739","01:12:43:14","01:12:44:17","Young Master."
"1","8","740","01:12:54:17","01:12:56:19","I, Jang Uk,
the eldest son of the Jang family,"
"1","8","741","01:12:57:14","01:12:59:16","will join Songrim Jeongjingak."
