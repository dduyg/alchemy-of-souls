1,2,1,00:00:36:15,00:00:39:17,20 YEARS AGO
1,2,2,00:00:41:11,00:00:43:03,My lady…
1,2,3,00:00:45:15,00:00:47:12,My lady…
1,2,4,00:00:56:04,00:00:57:18,My lady…
1,2,5,00:01:01:16,00:01:03:19,I shall make Do-hwa mine.
1,2,6,00:01:03:21,00:01:06:11,"If she bears a child,
know that it is mine."
1,2,7,00:01:12:13,00:01:14:07,My lady…
1,2,8,00:01:15:05,00:01:16:13,My lord.
1,2,9,00:01:16:15,00:01:18:04,"Where are you going, my lord?"
1,2,10,00:01:28:22,00:01:30:14,I heard about Do-hwa.
1,2,11,00:01:31:04,00:01:32:20,We were just about to head over.
1,2,12,00:01:32:22,00:01:36:20,"Why are you here
when you should be mourning her?"
1,2,13,00:01:37:12,00:01:40:14,"I came here because this was
the only way to change his fate."
1,2,14,00:02:00:03,00:02:01:03,What are you doing?
1,2,15,00:02:27:05,00:02:29:03,What have you done?
1,2,16,00:02:29:05,00:02:31:07,I have blocked his gate of energy.
1,2,17,00:02:32:02,00:02:34:14,"He will not be able
to learn any spells while he is alive."
1,2,18,00:02:37:18,00:02:41:04,"I forbid anyone from opening
his gate of energy!"
1,2,19,00:02:41:22,00:02:45:23,How could you do this to your son?
1,2,20,00:02:47:20,00:02:49:01,My son?
1,2,21,00:02:58:08,00:03:00:12,Why would he decide my own fate?
1,2,22,00:03:01:20,00:03:04:00,"No one even considers him
as my true father anyway!"
1,2,23,00:03:04:20,00:03:05:24,I will find someone.
1,2,24,00:03:06:15,00:03:08:11,A master who will open my gate of energy
1,2,25,00:03:08:13,00:03:10:13,and teach me how to practice spells.
1,2,26,00:03:11:12,00:03:13:08,I will find someone myself.
1,2,27,00:03:14:14,00:03:17:00,"Then I will take out that sword
and break it in two."
1,2,28,00:03:22:05,00:03:26:01,"I have met a total of 12 masters
and have been kicked out every time."
1,2,29,00:03:27:20,00:03:31:06,"And finally, I have met the master
who will change my fate."
1,2,30,00:03:42:22,00:03:44:17,I knew the moment I saw you.
1,2,31,00:03:46:11,00:03:47:21,You are my master.
1,2,32,00:03:58:18,00:04:02:06,"Did you find something special about me,"
1,2,33,00:04:02:09,00:04:03:10,Young Master?
1,2,34,00:04:06:09,00:04:08:06,I told you that you have beautiful eyes.
1,2,35,00:04:08:08,00:04:10:16,"Right, sorry.
Only your eyes are beautiful."
1,2,36,00:04:12:08,00:04:14:20,"The soul shifter's blue mark
has bloomed inside them."
1,2,37,00:04:16:14,00:04:18:12,So the mark was inside my eyes.
1,2,38,00:04:22:22,00:04:24:04,You are going to fight me?
1,2,39,00:04:24:06,00:04:25:24,Killing you would be a breeze.
1,2,40,00:04:26:13,00:04:27:21,But this is Songrim.
1,2,41,00:04:28:15,00:04:30:00,You will get caught.
1,2,42,00:04:42:13,00:04:44:15,I am planning to save you.
1,2,43,00:04:44:17,00:04:47:18,"You will not get caught
if you stay by my side."
1,2,44,00:05:01:17,00:05:03:23,"How should you address me
if you want to lie low?"
1,2,45,00:05:06:10,00:05:07:18,"""Young Master."""
1,2,46,00:05:20:22,00:05:21:22,Jang Uk?
1,2,47,00:05:22:14,00:05:23:19,"Yes, it is me."
1,2,48,00:05:24:07,00:05:25:18,Why are you here?
1,2,49,00:05:29:12,00:05:30:13,And who is she?
1,2,50,00:05:31:22,00:05:32:18,Right.
1,2,51,00:05:34:01,00:05:36:00,"She is Mu-deok, my maid."
1,2,52,00:05:38:15,00:05:39:20,Mu-deok?
1,2,53,00:05:42:12,00:05:46:18,"Yul, you startled her.
Can you put your blade down?"
1,2,54,00:05:47:15,00:05:48:19,Right.
1,2,55,00:05:51:15,00:05:53:13,"Mu-deok, are you all right?"
1,2,56,00:05:56:09,00:05:57:10,Mu-deok.
1,2,57,00:05:59:22,00:06:01:20,"I am fine, Young Master."
1,2,58,00:06:02:10,00:06:03:08,Good.
1,2,59,00:06:04:07,00:06:05:09,Uk?
1,2,60,00:06:06:03,00:06:07:01,Hey.
1,2,61,00:06:08:10,00:06:10:24,Hold on. Why are you here?
1,2,62,00:06:11:01,00:06:14:15,"I came to visit the leader.
We took refuge here after hearing a fight."
1,2,63,00:06:15:08,00:06:18:03,"There were intruders.
You cannot even fight."
1,2,64,00:06:18:05,00:06:21:02,"Jeez. Thank goodness
they did not spot you."
1,2,65,00:06:21:04,00:06:22:15,No.
1,2,66,00:06:22:17,00:06:25:01,It was wise of you to hide here.
1,2,67,00:06:25:03,00:06:28:08,"My maid ran away,
so I just followed her, you…"
1,2,68,00:06:28:10,00:06:29:16,"Gosh, that hurts…"
1,2,69,00:06:30:10,00:06:32:03,Who is she?
1,2,70,00:06:37:04,00:06:38:12,What is with that blade?
1,2,71,00:06:45:05,00:06:46:01,You…
1,2,72,00:06:49:07,00:06:51:05,Were you trying to protect him with that?
1,2,73,00:06:52:04,00:06:53:24,I am proud of you.
1,2,74,00:06:54:00,00:06:57:08,"That is right. Your young master
is extremely weak,"
1,2,75,00:06:57:10,00:06:59:08,so you need to protect him.
1,2,76,00:07:01:12,00:07:02:16,Of course.
1,2,77,00:07:02:18,00:07:04:24,I ought to protect my young master.
1,2,78,00:07:06:00,00:07:08:07,"No, that is not true."
1,2,79,00:07:09:13,00:07:12:08,I should protect you instead.
1,2,80,00:07:13:20,00:07:15:03,What is with the strong grip?
1,2,81,00:07:15:22,00:07:16:24,Let go.
1,2,82,00:07:25:00,00:07:28:14,Mudeoki! You should not glare like that!
1,2,83,00:07:29:07,00:07:30:12,You should look down.
1,2,84,00:07:32:24,00:07:35:09,"Yes, Young Master."
1,2,85,00:07:36:16,00:07:38:23,So you were the one who ran away from me.
1,2,86,00:07:39:00,00:07:40:08,"Mu-deok, was it?"
1,2,87,00:07:41:07,00:07:42:20,I am sorry to have startled you.
1,2,88,00:07:55:02,00:07:56:16,Are you injured?
1,2,89,00:08:09:13,00:08:10:14,Mu-deok.
1,2,90,00:08:11:11,00:08:13:23,"I am fine, Young Master."
1,2,91,00:08:16:23,00:08:19:01,"-Has the dust settled?
-No."
1,2,92,00:08:19:03,00:08:20:07,It is still chaotic.
1,2,93,00:08:20:21,00:08:22:20,"Soul Shifter Naksu's body
has gone missing."
1,2,94,00:08:24:04,00:08:26:20,I knew it. They were the Danju's men.
1,2,95,00:08:26:22,00:08:29:12,"Now, I just need
to get out of here safely."
1,2,96,00:08:30:05,00:08:31:24,What a pity.
1,2,97,00:08:32:18,00:08:33:24,The soul shifter.
1,2,98,00:08:34:01,00:08:36:02,"Naksu, the Shadow Assassin."
1,2,99,00:08:37:08,00:08:40:22,I was always curious about how she looked.
1,2,100,00:08:43:00,00:08:45:08,He knows who I am.
1,2,101,00:08:45:09,00:08:47:16,I must kill him before I leave.
1,2,102,00:08:52:07,00:08:55:09,"They must have broken
the pine forest barrier and gone out."
1,2,103,00:09:08:16,00:09:10:11,So they broke the barrier.
1,2,104,00:09:10:13,00:09:12:22,"-We will go after them.
-It is too late."
1,2,105,00:09:14:10,00:09:16:23,"Only those of Songrim
can break the barrier."
1,2,106,00:09:18:01,00:09:19:20,There is a spy among us.
1,2,107,00:09:21:12,00:09:23:18,We must ask the Jin family for help.
1,2,108,00:09:30:10,00:09:33:12,Naksu's body was in this secret room.
1,2,109,00:09:34:14,00:09:37:24,"Uk, did you notice anything suspicious
while hiding in Jeongjingak?"
1,2,110,00:09:38:01,00:09:39:15,Suspicious?
1,2,111,00:09:39:17,00:09:42:11,No. I was only watching Mu-deok.
1,2,112,00:09:46:22,00:09:50:11,"Do you think Naksu shifted her soul
into another woman's body"
1,2,113,00:09:50:13,00:09:51:24,and came to retrieve her body?
1,2,114,00:09:55:21,00:09:58:06,"Can women only shift souls
to the same gender?"
1,2,115,00:09:58:08,00:09:59:11,Not really.
1,2,116,00:09:59:13,00:10:03:03,"But for everything to go smoothly,
I heard they should pick someone similar."
1,2,117,00:10:03:05,00:10:06:00,"Gender, age, and build.
They all need to be similar."
1,2,118,00:10:07:23,00:10:09:13,"I am only asking
because I have not seen her."
1,2,119,00:10:09:15,00:10:13:16,Was Naksu thin with short limbs?
1,2,120,00:10:13:18,00:10:16:10,"Did she have a round face
like Mu-deok right here?"
1,2,121,00:10:16:12,00:10:18:08,What the hell is his problem?
1,2,122,00:10:20:22,00:10:24:11,"If that was the case,
she would not have been nicknamed ""Naksu""."
1,2,123,00:10:24:13,00:10:25:10,Look at her.
1,2,124,00:10:26:05,00:10:28:23,"What kind of an assassin
looks this adorable?"
1,2,125,00:10:29:20,00:10:30:20,You are right.
1,2,126,00:10:30:23,00:10:33:04,I bet she was a monster.
1,2,127,00:10:33:06,00:10:35:10,"No, she was human."
1,2,128,00:10:37:07,00:10:40:08,"Let us not belittle the dead,
even if she was an assassin."
1,2,129,00:10:46:06,00:10:48:07,Master Heo Yeom wants to see you.
1,2,130,00:10:48:09,00:10:50:08,Go without me. He dislikes me anyway.
1,2,131,00:10:50:11,00:10:52:03,Right. Being here would be safer.
1,2,132,00:10:52:05,00:10:53:10,Let us go.
1,2,133,00:11:04:21,00:11:06:15,The body was frozen here.
1,2,134,00:11:06:17,00:11:10:12,"Seeing how there is no rotting smell,
your body must still be fine."
1,2,135,00:11:12:11,00:11:13:12,Naksu.
1,2,136,00:11:15:03,00:11:16:07,That is right.
1,2,137,00:11:17:03,00:11:19:11,I am the Shadow Assassin.
1,2,138,00:11:22:04,00:11:23:11,Naksu.
1,2,139,00:11:28:04,00:11:30:09,"I thought long and hard
about why you helped me."
1,2,140,00:11:32:16,00:11:34:12,Did the Danju send you too?
1,2,141,00:11:34:14,00:11:36:24,No. No one sent me here.
1,2,142,00:11:37:01,00:11:38:24,Then why did you help me?
1,2,143,00:11:39:01,00:11:42:11,"I already told you,
but I guess you did not get the message."
1,2,144,00:11:45:05,00:11:46:13,You have beautiful eyes.
1,2,145,00:11:47:07,00:11:48:13,Do not tell me
1,2,146,00:11:49:20,00:11:51:02,you really fell for me.
1,2,147,00:11:53:09,00:11:54:10,Do not laugh.
1,2,148,00:11:55:00,00:11:57:04,That is the only thing that makes sense.
1,2,149,00:11:57:06,00:11:59:04,I do admit repeatedly calling you pretty.
1,2,150,00:12:00:04,00:12:02:00,But it was because I desired something.
1,2,151,00:12:02:15,00:12:03:20,Which was?
1,2,152,00:12:04:11,00:12:08:19,"I have been searching for someone who
can break this spell to call my master."
1,2,153,00:12:09:14,00:12:11:00,"And then, I found you."
1,2,154,00:12:13:00,00:12:14:02,Naksu.
1,2,155,00:12:14:22,00:12:16:21,I want you to be my master.
1,2,156,00:12:32:19,00:12:33:23,I heard.
1,2,157,00:12:34:00,00:12:36:01,"You borrowed
the Jin family's ghost Sapsali?"
1,2,158,00:12:36:03,00:12:37:02,"Yes, my lord."
1,2,159,00:12:37:16,00:12:41:03,Are you certain that thing is in Songrim?
1,2,160,00:12:41:05,00:12:42:07,I am.
1,2,161,00:12:43:08,00:12:47:01,A soul shifter is lurking within Songrim.
1,2,162,00:12:51:13,00:12:53:13,The son of Jang Gang of Songrim
1,2,163,00:12:53:15,00:12:56:01,"is asking me, an assassin,
to be his master?"
1,2,164,00:12:57:18,00:12:59:12,What original nonsense.
1,2,165,00:13:01:03,00:13:04:15,"You will open your pupil's gate of energy
and help him master spells."
1,2,166,00:13:05:05,00:13:08:01,"As your pupil,
I will keep you safe and hidden."
1,2,167,00:13:08:03,00:13:11:11,"We could form a beautiful relationship
where we benefit from each other."
1,2,168,00:13:11:13,00:13:13:10,"-Not interested.
-If you do not want to be my master,"
1,2,169,00:13:13:12,00:13:15:05,you could be my wife instead.
1,2,170,00:13:15:07,00:13:16:14,"-Would you like that?
-Shut it."
1,2,171,00:13:17:06,00:13:20:05,"I heard you visited many masters
and got kicked out every time."
1,2,172,00:13:20:07,00:13:22:06,Was it because you were this stubborn?
1,2,173,00:13:26:05,00:13:29:14,"I could not threaten my former masters
since they had no weakness."
1,2,174,00:13:30:04,00:13:33:22,But you have a pretty big one.
1,2,175,00:13:37:02,00:13:39:10,"You cannot get out of here alive
without my help."
1,2,176,00:13:40:04,00:13:42:02,You will die if they find out who you are.
1,2,177,00:13:43:00,00:13:44:04,Is that so?
1,2,178,00:13:44:24,00:13:46:11,"In that case,"
1,2,179,00:13:49:21,00:13:51:05,I will just kill you.
1,2,180,00:13:53:16,00:13:56:14,"How merciless. After all, I helped you."
1,2,181,00:13:56:16,00:13:59:15,"Sorry that I am so merciless
for such a cute face."
1,2,182,00:14:08:21,00:14:11:03,"I brought you to our house
with the Jade Plaque"
1,2,183,00:14:11:20,00:14:13:21,and to Songrim with the Spirit Plaque.
1,2,184,00:14:14:16,00:14:16:18,"And now, look where we are."
1,2,185,00:14:24:13,00:14:26:03,This is Songrim's secret room.
1,2,186,00:14:27:01,00:14:30:13,"Once that door closes, we can only get out
if someone opens from the outside."
1,2,187,00:14:31:19,00:14:33:09,We are locked in here together.
1,2,188,00:14:35:15,00:14:36:19,Do not move!
1,2,189,00:14:37:07,00:14:39:22,"Step on the wrong spot,
and the ground will cave in."
1,2,190,00:14:43:04,00:14:47:07,"Kill me, and you will be killed
by the Songrim mages who will enter."
1,2,191,00:14:47:09,00:14:50:18,"But if you agree to be my master,
we will get out of this unscathed."
1,2,192,00:14:54:04,00:14:57:06,"I do not have the strength
to break his gate of energy right now."
1,2,193,00:14:57:19,00:14:59:16,He will catch wind of it if I stay here.
1,2,194,00:15:00:05,00:15:01:07,I need my sword.
1,2,195,00:15:02:16,00:15:04:15,I have become weak due to shifting souls.
1,2,196,00:15:04:17,00:15:07:13,"I need my sword's energy
to open your gate of energy."
1,2,197,00:15:08:01,00:15:09:06,"Without that,"
1,2,198,00:15:09:21,00:15:12:13,there is nothing I can do in here.
1,2,199,00:15:13:16,00:15:15:03,"To retrieve my sword,"
1,2,200,00:15:16:12,00:15:17:17,I need to go out there.
1,2,201,00:15:17:19,00:15:18:23,So stop that.
1,2,202,00:15:21:04,00:15:22:11,Did you not hear me?
1,2,203,00:15:22:13,00:15:25:15,"I cannot do that. I need to wait
until it fully closes first."
1,2,204,00:15:27:07,00:15:29:11,"You! You lied, did you not?"
1,2,205,00:15:32:14,00:15:33:20,Do not move!
1,2,206,00:15:33:22,00:15:36:01,"-If you do, the ground will cave in!
-Wait!"
1,2,207,00:15:39:03,00:15:40:19,Grab tightly! You are slipping!
1,2,208,00:15:41:16,00:15:44:06,"-Where is your face touching?
-Shut it!"
1,2,209,00:15:44:09,00:15:46:01,"-Hey!
-Hey!"
1,2,210,00:15:46:03,00:15:47:02,You little…
1,2,211,00:15:47:21,00:15:50:13,"-That hurts!
-It was not intentional."
1,2,212,00:15:50:15,00:15:52:18,"-It hurts!
-Just wait."
1,2,213,00:15:53:08,00:15:54:04,Let me go.
1,2,214,00:16:00:00,00:16:02:06,"By the way, how will we find your sword?"
1,2,215,00:16:03:03,00:16:05:03,I know who took it. I can find it.
1,2,216,00:16:06:10,00:16:08:08,It is too dangerous to get out of Songrim.
1,2,217,00:16:08:10,00:16:10:01,We need to stay inside.
1,2,218,00:16:11:08,00:16:13:06,Does it have to be that specific sword?
1,2,219,00:16:13:08,00:16:15:03,"Get another sword with that energy
and do it here."
1,2,220,00:16:15:05,00:16:17:08,I cannot. It has to be mine.
1,2,221,00:16:18:15,00:16:20:02,Let us go out and find it.
1,2,222,00:16:21:01,00:16:24:04,I will lure him out and then kill him.
1,2,223,00:16:25:13,00:16:27:06,You said you became weak.
1,2,224,00:16:30:07,00:16:32:13,"I thought you were pretending
to be clumsy."
1,2,225,00:16:33:22,00:16:35:01,How weak have you become?
1,2,226,00:16:38:04,00:16:39:14,The mages are coming.
1,2,227,00:16:39:16,00:16:40:17,Stay alert.
1,2,228,00:16:43:14,00:16:46:13,Why would I? They are on my side.
1,2,229,00:16:48:01,00:16:50:13,"Taking sides?
Are you seriously that childish?"
1,2,230,00:16:50:15,00:16:52:11,"Why are you talking casually
in this situation?"
1,2,231,00:16:52:13,00:16:53:19,"Fine, Young Master."
1,2,232,00:16:53:21,00:16:55:02,I will look down.
1,2,233,00:16:55:20,00:16:56:24,Look at you.
1,2,234,00:17:04:05,00:17:05:06,Who is she?
1,2,235,00:17:06:01,00:17:09:02,"I am Mu-deok, his maid."
1,2,236,00:17:11:15,00:17:13:15,"You heard her, right? She is my maid."
1,2,237,00:17:14:04,00:17:15:22,"You all seem busy. Go on, then."
1,2,238,00:17:15:24,00:17:18:10,"-Let us go, Mu-deok.
-You may not leave."
1,2,239,00:17:21:02,00:17:24:02,"The leader ordered everyone
to gather at the Training Center."
1,2,240,00:17:26:10,00:17:27:20,I am not a member of Songrim.
1,2,241,00:17:27:23,00:17:30:04,"He wants every living thing
within these walls"
1,2,242,00:17:30:19,00:17:33:01,to gather there.
1,2,243,00:17:41:16,00:17:43:03,"-Uk.
-Hey."
1,2,244,00:17:45:01,00:17:47:12,"What is going on?
Why are we gathered here?"
1,2,245,00:17:48:00,00:17:50:16,"They are going to catch
Naksu's men who are in here."
1,2,246,00:17:52:20,00:17:54:01,Naksu?
1,2,247,00:18:04:20,00:18:06:01,One of you
1,2,248,00:18:06:03,00:18:08:24,"has helped Naksu's men
who sneaked in here today."
1,2,249,00:18:09:20,00:18:10:20,My lord.
1,2,250,00:18:10:23,00:18:14:02,Everyone here knows each other.
1,2,251,00:18:14:04,00:18:17:20,"On the outside,
you all look like those of Songrim."
1,2,252,00:18:20:01,00:18:21:24,That is why I asked someone for help.
1,2,253,00:18:23:04,00:18:26:10,"Lady Jin Cho-yeon of the Jin family
has brought Gwigu."
1,2,254,00:19:02:02,00:19:03:03,"Hello, my lady."
1,2,255,00:19:17:02,00:19:19:06,Why is Jang Uk here?
1,2,256,00:19:20:08,00:19:21:09,I am not sure.
1,2,257,00:19:32:00,00:19:34:24,"That must be Gwigu,
the Jin family's heirloom."
1,2,258,00:19:35:01,00:19:36:02,Gwigu?
1,2,259,00:19:36:16,00:19:37:24,"-As in a dog?
-Yes."
1,2,260,00:19:38:01,00:19:40:19,"It is a ghost Sapsali
that detects sorcery."
1,2,261,00:19:45:08,00:19:46:12,There is
1,2,262,00:19:47:14,00:19:48:20,a soul shifter among us.
1,2,263,00:19:50:06,00:19:54:09,And Gwigu will find that individual.
1,2,264,00:19:55:00,00:19:57:16,They look like one of us on the outside.
1,2,265,00:19:57:18,00:20:01:02,"But Gwigu will find the one
who has a different soul within them."
1,2,266,00:20:07:07,00:20:09:00,Close all the doors.
1,2,267,00:20:09:03,00:20:10:00,"-Yes, my lord!
-Yes, my lord!"
1,2,268,00:20:14:19,00:20:19:03,Whoever tries to leave this building
1,2,269,00:20:19:05,00:20:22:11,will be considered a spy and killed.
1,2,270,00:20:23:23,00:20:25:01,You may begin.
1,2,271,00:21:26:08,00:21:29:20,"The alchemy of souls, a type of sorcery,
has one weakness."
1,2,272,00:21:29:22,00:21:31:21,"There is a gap
between the body and the soul."
1,2,273,00:21:31:23,00:21:34:09,The evil energy seeps out from it.
1,2,274,00:21:34:11,00:21:36:20,And Gwigu can detect that.
1,2,275,00:22:05:14,00:22:08:14,"Uk, feign ignorance even if I get caught."
1,2,276,00:22:10:24,00:22:13:02,"-Is this loyalty?
-It is my duty."
1,2,277,00:22:19:07,00:22:21:18,I do not want to become a laughingstock
1,2,278,00:22:22:10,00:22:24:09,once they find out I asked you for help.
1,2,279,00:22:24:11,00:22:25:24,Stay right by my side.
1,2,280,00:22:27:03,00:22:30:20,No one here will let that thing attack me.
1,2,281,00:23:01:23,00:23:03:07,He is a soul shifter! Get him!
1,2,282,00:24:31:23,00:24:35:00,"I heard soul shifters get petrified
when they run wild and lose their energy."
1,2,283,00:24:35:02,00:24:36:07,It was true.
1,2,284,00:25:04:21,00:25:07:08,We thank you for your great help.
1,2,285,00:25:08:17,00:25:10:24,"I am sure one day
we will ask you for help too."
1,2,286,00:25:12:03,00:25:16:17,"I see that Daeho's four families
have all gathered here."
1,2,287,00:25:16:20,00:25:18:22,I heard you are called the Four Seasons.
1,2,288,00:25:19:11,00:25:22:16,Seeing you all together makes me happy.
1,2,289,00:25:23:09,00:25:25:02,"We used to gather often,"
1,2,290,00:25:25:04,00:25:28:10,"but it is our first time after Uk
and Cho-yeon called off their wedding."
1,2,291,00:25:29:22,00:25:31:07,You little…
1,2,292,00:25:31:21,00:25:34:08,"I told them to prepare some tea
in the reception room."
1,2,293,00:25:34:10,00:25:35:15,Please come.
1,2,294,00:25:42:07,00:25:44:02,You were here as well.
1,2,295,00:25:44:19,00:25:46:22,I heard you were kicked out of Gisan.
1,2,296,00:25:46:24,00:25:48:12,Right.
1,2,297,00:25:49:10,00:25:52:05,"You should stop
keeping track of what I am doing."
1,2,298,00:25:54:24,00:25:57:22,"Everyone was talking about
how you got kicked out yet again."
1,2,299,00:25:57:24,00:25:59:13,I just happened to hear it.
1,2,300,00:25:59:14,00:26:00:23,I see.
1,2,301,00:26:01:24,00:26:04:21,"Our precious guest here
seems uncomfortable around me,"
1,2,302,00:26:04:23,00:26:06:07,so let me excuse myself.
1,2,303,00:26:09:19,00:26:11:00,What a scumbag.
1,2,304,00:26:12:22,00:26:13:23,Let us go.
1,2,305,00:26:16:03,00:26:17:05,Let us go.
1,2,306,00:26:29:06,00:26:31:16,"Hey, excuse me."
1,2,307,00:26:32:18,00:26:34:17,Did you see my maid?
1,2,308,00:26:35:07,00:26:37:23,"She is short, thin, and has a round face."
1,2,309,00:26:38:00,00:26:39:07,Darn it.
1,2,310,00:26:40:04,00:26:41:20,Where did she go?
1,2,311,00:26:43:14,00:26:46:16,"The spy the Danju had sent here
was a soul shifter."
1,2,312,00:26:48:07,00:26:49:24,I must find the Danju.
1,2,313,00:27:01:02,00:27:03:13,"You were not loyal,
but you said you knew your duties."
1,2,314,00:27:04:03,00:27:06:01,Can you say the same thing about this?
1,2,315,00:27:07:03,00:27:09:13,"That is exactly
why I am leaving you behind."
1,2,316,00:27:09:15,00:27:12:01,"My original plan
was to take you with me and kill you."
1,2,317,00:27:12:03,00:27:13:02,I see.
1,2,318,00:27:13:22,00:27:15:06,How evil.
1,2,319,00:27:15:08,00:27:19:00,"I am not the round-faced Mu-deok,
your loyal maid."
1,2,320,00:27:19:23,00:27:22:22,You are Naksu. The merciless assassin.
1,2,321,00:27:25:14,00:27:28:07,"You had the chance to kill me
when I was bathing."
1,2,322,00:27:28:09,00:27:30:15,"I even risked my life
bringing you here with me."
1,2,323,00:27:31:21,00:27:33:24,"It is up to you
whether to still kill me now"
1,2,324,00:27:34:01,00:27:37:00,"or become my master
after opening my gate of energy."
1,2,325,00:27:42:11,00:27:46:15,"By the way, you have the habit
of glaring at others."
1,2,326,00:27:46:17,00:27:48:23,"Keep doing that, and you will get caught."
1,2,327,00:27:50:02,00:27:52:06,"Can you see the mark
from where you are at?"
1,2,328,00:27:53:16,00:27:54:17,No.
1,2,329,00:27:57:15,00:27:58:14,What about now?
1,2,330,00:28:01:10,00:28:02:21,I can see it since I know already.
1,2,331,00:28:04:21,00:28:05:24,And now?
1,2,332,00:28:13:10,00:28:15:02,I can definitely see it.
1,2,333,00:28:15:04,00:28:17:21,"But I doubt you will be
this up-close with someone often."
1,2,334,00:28:18:13,00:28:20:10,Just be careful when you kiss someone.
1,2,335,00:28:22:18,00:28:24:15,Come on. I am just helping you out.
1,2,336,00:28:24:17,00:28:27:04,"Anyone who came that close to me
died in my hands."
1,2,337,00:28:29:16,00:28:31:00,You could die tonight.
1,2,338,00:28:32:10,00:28:33:15,It is the ghost Sapsali.
1,2,339,00:28:41:03,00:28:42:14,"If that thing attacks you,"
1,2,340,00:28:42:16,00:28:44:11,will you turn to stone like that guy?
1,2,341,00:28:46:09,00:28:47:13,Run.
1,2,342,00:28:49:16,00:28:50:18,I will try to save you.
1,2,343,00:30:13:14,00:30:15:04,Gwigu's pottery.
1,2,344,00:30:15:06,00:30:17:10,It was our family heirloom.
1,2,345,00:30:18:17,00:30:21:15,I just wanted to take a look at it.
1,2,346,00:30:21:17,00:30:24:19,"But what kind of an heirloom
is this fragile?"
1,2,347,00:30:24:21,00:30:26:05,Jang Uk!
1,2,348,00:30:29:22,00:30:31:16,We need to talk. Come here.
1,2,349,00:30:32:08,00:30:33:10,Uk.
1,2,350,00:30:35:11,00:30:36:14,Uk.
1,2,351,00:30:38:10,00:30:41:15,"Hey, Uk. Jang Uk!"
1,2,352,00:30:46:08,00:30:47:10,Uk!
1,2,353,00:30:48:19,00:30:49:21,Uk!
1,2,354,00:30:50:11,00:30:51:20,Jang Uk!
1,2,355,00:30:52:09,00:30:53:19,Darn it!
1,2,356,00:30:55:02,00:30:56:01,Uk!
1,2,357,00:30:57:06,00:30:58:07,Gather all the pieces
1,2,358,00:30:58:09,00:31:00:15,"since I will have to
put them back together."
1,2,359,00:31:00:17,00:31:01:24,"-Yes, my lady.
-Yes, my lady."
1,2,360,00:31:17:05,00:31:18:12,Jeez.
1,2,361,00:31:19:03,00:31:20:23,That is the work of your young master.
1,2,362,00:31:22:16,00:31:25:08,So that is how he saved me.
1,2,363,00:31:25:10,00:31:26:12,"Gosh, that kid."
1,2,364,00:31:26:14,00:31:29:03,"Last year, he broke off the engagement
with the Jin family."
1,2,365,00:31:29:05,00:31:31:16,"This time, he broke their heirloom."
1,2,366,00:31:31:18,00:31:33:24,"-Engagement?
-Yes."
1,2,367,00:31:35:04,00:31:37:01,He called off the wedding with her.
1,2,368,00:31:37:18,00:31:41:06,"He got kicked out 12 times,
broke off a wedding, and now, an heirloom."
1,2,369,00:31:41:08,00:31:42:20,What a disaster.
1,2,370,00:31:45:14,00:31:47:07,What will you do about him?
1,2,371,00:31:48:04,00:31:49:09,Where is he?
1,2,372,00:31:50:09,00:31:51:06,He got dragged away.
1,2,373,00:31:51:23,00:31:55:07,"I am afraid he will face
severe punishment this time."
1,2,374,00:32:02:17,00:32:05:05,I sent you to Gisan.
1,2,375,00:32:06:07,00:32:08:12,"Then you were kicked out
in less than six months."
1,2,376,00:32:09:08,00:32:11:02,Why did you come here tonight?
1,2,377,00:32:11:04,00:32:14:05,"I heard you were troubled by the news,
so I came to apologize."
1,2,378,00:32:14:20,00:32:16:04,Is this how you apologize?
1,2,379,00:32:18:20,00:32:21:17,Why did you break the pottery?
1,2,380,00:32:21:19,00:32:24:12,"I was fascinated by it
and wanted to take a look,"
1,2,381,00:32:24:14,00:32:26:18,but it slipped out of my hands.
1,2,382,00:32:26:20,00:32:29:08,"Had I learned spells,
that would not have happened."
1,2,383,00:32:29:11,00:32:30:22,I guess I lack the teachings.
1,2,384,00:32:30:24,00:32:32:14,Jang Uk!
1,2,385,00:32:34:06,00:32:36:02,He also tampered
1,2,386,00:32:36:04,00:32:38:08,"with the door of the secret room
and damaged it."
1,2,387,00:32:38:20,00:32:41:24,"He definitely did that on purpose.
He is just jealous."
1,2,388,00:32:42:18,00:32:45:21,I will not let it slide this time around.
1,2,389,00:32:46:19,00:32:49:24,"Until I say so, I forbid Jang Uk"
1,2,390,00:32:50:01,00:32:53:18,from moving or talking.
1,2,391,00:32:55:01,00:32:56:08,Repent.
1,2,392,00:33:15:14,00:33:16:14,Do not worry.
1,2,393,00:33:18:00,00:33:19:22,He will not punish him for too long.
1,2,394,00:33:21:11,00:33:23:23,"He almost died of a cold
after he was punished"
1,2,395,00:33:24:01,00:33:25:04,all night long one day.
1,2,396,00:33:26:02,00:33:29:09,"Uk's gate of energy is opened
just enough to keep him alive."
1,2,397,00:33:29:11,00:33:32:01,"So extreme cold or heat
can be life-threatening."
1,2,398,00:33:32:21,00:33:34:01,He cannot recover when he falls ill.
1,2,399,00:33:34:15,00:33:38:12,"Then open his gate of energy for him.
He desperately wants it."
1,2,400,00:33:39:03,00:33:40:21,You are his friends.
1,2,401,00:33:41:22,00:33:43:19,We are still too weak to do that.
1,2,402,00:33:45:02,00:33:46:14,But no one in Songrim…
1,2,403,00:33:46:16,00:33:50:06,No. No one in Daeho is allowed to do that.
1,2,404,00:33:55:12,00:33:58:15,"Then he is already being punished
for his entire lifetime."
1,2,405,00:34:33:08,00:34:35:09,You are allowed to have a hot cup of tea.
1,2,406,00:34:38:22,00:34:40:01,Young Master.
1,2,407,00:34:40:16,00:34:43:14,I will go first and leave you behind.
1,2,408,00:34:45:04,00:34:46:13,You are leaving without me?
1,2,409,00:34:54:00,00:34:56:09,You are loyal and know your duties.
1,2,410,00:34:57:06,00:34:59:16,"That is why you took me in,
brought me here,"
1,2,411,00:35:00:18,00:35:02:22,and protected me.
1,2,412,00:35:03:24,00:35:07:06,"You must know very well
that you cannot tell that to anyone."
1,2,413,00:35:20:03,00:35:22:16,I will be safe thanks to you.
1,2,414,00:35:33:16,00:35:36:17,"The people I have met so far
only wanted me dead."
1,2,415,00:35:37:24,00:35:39:21,You are the first person
1,2,416,00:35:41:05,00:35:42:21,who tried to save me.
1,2,417,00:35:49:04,00:35:51:20,"Even if we meet again
and come this close to each other,"
1,2,418,00:35:52:11,00:35:53:24,I will spare you.
1,2,419,00:36:51:02,00:36:53:24,I will send a gift of apology to Gisan
1,2,420,00:36:54:01,00:36:58:05,"and pay the Jin family a hefty sum
for what he did."
1,2,421,00:36:58:19,00:37:02:05,Uk made too many mistakes this time.
1,2,422,00:37:03:19,00:37:05:11,I had no choice but to punish him.
1,2,423,00:37:05:13,00:37:07:09,I am glad you punished him.
1,2,424,00:37:08:11,00:37:11:19,"Since you have done enough,
I will take him home now."
1,2,425,00:37:12:13,00:37:13:17,Sure.
1,2,426,00:37:15:09,00:37:16:13,Thank you.
1,2,427,00:37:22:11,00:37:25:13,"-Are you all right?
-No, I am not."
1,2,428,00:37:27:13,00:37:29:18,Did Mudeoki stop by our place?
1,2,429,00:37:30:08,00:37:32:08,Why would she?
1,2,430,00:37:33:05,00:37:36:21,"Speaking of which, where did she go
while you were being punished?"
1,2,431,00:37:37:12,00:37:38:14,Forget it.
1,2,432,00:37:41:22,00:37:44:19,"By the way, why did you tamper
with the secret room?"
1,2,433,00:37:45:21,00:37:47:10,The stone door will not close.
1,2,434,00:37:48:02,00:37:49:10,I do not know.
1,2,435,00:37:52:07,00:37:54:20,"-Why did you break the pottery?
-I do not…"
1,2,436,00:37:56:20,00:37:58:09,I said I do not know.
1,2,437,00:37:59:00,00:38:00:08,Stop asking me.
1,2,438,00:38:10:11,00:38:12:09,Here are the firecrackers you wanted.
1,2,439,00:38:12:11,00:38:14:12,"They will be able to see them
from miles away."
1,2,440,00:38:17:13,00:38:18:16,All right.
1,2,441,00:38:19:16,00:38:22:15,Why does Young Master Jang want them?
1,2,442,00:38:22:17,00:38:25:02,"Rumor has it that
he was punished severely."
1,2,443,00:38:25:04,00:38:26:16,So what is he scheming this time?
1,2,444,00:38:28:17,00:38:29:17,It is a secret.
1,2,445,00:38:30:13,00:38:32:08,"Do not tell anyone about this, okay?"
1,2,446,00:38:34:03,00:38:35:09,Ju-wol.
1,2,447,00:38:37:06,00:38:39:08,He should lie low for now.
1,2,448,00:38:46:01,00:38:47:11,This is Songrim's Spirit Plaque.
1,2,449,00:38:48:00,00:38:49:22,Are you free to enter there?
1,2,450,00:38:49:24,00:38:52:04,Your young master must really trust you.
1,2,451,00:38:52:22,00:38:55:00,This is such a precious item.
1,2,452,00:38:56:02,00:38:57:15,He wants me to sell it.
1,2,453,00:38:58:13,00:39:01:05,"You cannot sell
something like this that easily."
1,2,454,00:39:01:07,00:39:02:07,Is that so?
1,2,455,00:39:02:21,00:39:05:03,"He said I would be able
to sell it somewhere."
1,2,456,00:39:05:17,00:39:06:18,"But then again,"
1,2,457,00:39:06:21,00:39:10:05,"there is a merchant
who purchases black market goods."
1,2,458,00:39:11:20,00:39:14:05,But it will not be easy to hook you up.
1,2,459,00:39:20:18,00:39:22:21,You will be getting a hefty sum.
1,2,460,00:39:22:23,00:39:24:21,Can I have another chicken?
1,2,461,00:39:24:23,00:39:27:13,"Sure. I will put it on
your young master's tab."
1,2,462,00:39:27:15,00:39:29:13,Eat up. Eat lots.
1,2,463,00:39:36:19,00:39:41:02,"Naksu's body may be here,
but her soul lives on in another body."
1,2,464,00:39:41:24,00:39:45:22,"You will also be given new bodies
through the alchemy of souls."
1,2,465,00:39:45:24,00:39:50:08,"So do not be afraid
to sacrifice yourselves for me."
1,2,466,00:39:50:10,00:39:51:14,"-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir."
1,2,467,00:40:11:18,00:40:12:16,Fire!
1,2,468,00:40:31:08,00:40:32:21,I need my sword.
1,2,469,00:40:32:23,00:40:34:24,I have become weak due to shifting souls.
1,2,470,00:40:35:17,00:40:38:15,"I need my sword's energy
to open your gate of energy."
1,2,471,00:40:38:17,00:40:41:07,"Even if we meet again
and come this close to each other,"
1,2,472,00:40:41:22,00:40:43:09,I will spare you.
1,2,473,00:40:48:04,00:40:50:16,"-I have no appetite.
-Young Master Jang."
1,2,474,00:40:52:21,00:40:54:16,"Young Master Jang, they caught them."
1,2,475,00:40:55:06,00:40:57:22,"-Mudeoki?
-Why would anyone catch her?"
1,2,476,00:40:58:22,00:41:01:01,Never mind.
1,2,477,00:41:01:03,00:41:02:20,"Jin Mu, the Assistant Gwanju
of Cheonbugwan,"
1,2,478,00:41:02:22,00:41:05:08,caught Naksu's men who raided Songrim.
1,2,479,00:41:05:24,00:41:06:24,Really?
1,2,480,00:41:09:13,00:41:13:10,"Jin Mu brought the bodies
of Naksu's men into the palace."
1,2,481,00:41:13:12,00:41:15:16,We were the ones who caught Naksu.
1,2,482,00:41:15:18,00:41:18:13,"So I am worried
we will become a laughingstock."
1,2,483,00:41:18:15,00:41:21:15,Is it true that he spared
1,2,484,00:41:22:03,00:41:23:20,none of the men?
1,2,485,00:41:23:22,00:41:25:09,He killed them all.
1,2,486,00:41:26:22,00:41:29:18,"We have no way to track
the source of the alchemy of souls."
1,2,487,00:41:31:21,00:41:34:05,Jin Ho-gyeong of Jinyowon is here too.
1,2,488,00:41:39:08,00:41:41:11,"I heard Jin Mu,
the Assistant Gwanju of Cheonbugwan,"
1,2,489,00:41:41:13,00:41:44:08,"caught the assassins
that Songrim could not."
1,2,490,00:41:45:04,00:41:48:04,"How did they break
Songrim's barrier twice?"
1,2,491,00:41:53:00,00:41:55:06,"There was a soul shifter spy
inside Songrim."
1,2,492,00:41:55:08,00:41:58:15,"Thankfully, the Jin family's Gwigu
caught him."
1,2,493,00:41:59:15,00:42:00:22,Gwigu?
1,2,494,00:42:00:24,00:42:02:21,I would like to see it too.
1,2,495,00:42:02:23,00:42:05:05,I am afraid I cannot show you right now.
1,2,496,00:42:05:07,00:42:08:03,"They made the mistake
of accidentally breaking it."
1,2,497,00:42:09:05,00:42:11:12,How could you make such a foolish mistake?
1,2,498,00:42:12:23,00:42:14:04,"My apologies, Your Majesty."
1,2,499,00:42:15:06,00:42:19:10,"Since Jin Mu made this contribution,
I summoned you all to tell you"
1,2,500,00:42:19:12,00:42:21:18,"that I am considering
promoting him to Gwanju."
1,2,501,00:42:22:23,00:42:24:05,That is not right.
1,2,502,00:42:24:07,00:42:27:00,Jang Gang is still the current Gwanju.
1,2,503,00:42:27:02,00:42:30:02,"For he was given the robe
and the sword by the late king,"
1,2,504,00:42:30:04,00:42:32:01,Jang Gang is the Gwanju of Cheonbugwan.
1,2,505,00:42:32:15,00:42:35:07,"Furthermore, he has a son, Jang Uk."
1,2,506,00:42:35:09,00:42:36:05,Jang Gang…
1,2,507,00:42:37:01,00:42:38:10,has been away for decades
1,2,508,00:42:38:12,00:42:40:03,using his training as an excuse.
1,2,509,00:42:40:05,00:42:43:06,"His son, Jang Uk,
physically cannot learn spells."
1,2,510,00:42:43:08,00:42:45:08,Assistant Gwanju Jin Mu has been the one
1,2,511,00:42:46:13,00:42:47:15,to fill in for him.
1,2,512,00:42:49:11,00:42:51:18,"Your Majesty, the dark soul-related spell"
1,2,513,00:42:51:20,00:42:55:04,is forbidden sorcery among mages.
1,2,514,00:42:55:07,00:42:57:10,And Songrim has always been the one
1,2,515,00:42:57:23,00:42:59:19,to keep this under control.
1,2,516,00:43:00:09,00:43:03:21,"Songrim could have gotten to the bottom
of this soul shifter incident"
1,2,517,00:43:03:23,00:43:05:10,and gotten rid of it all.
1,2,518,00:43:07:01,00:43:10:23,"But Jin Mu
killed every single one of them."
1,2,519,00:43:12:01,00:43:14:12,He actually ruined everything.
1,2,520,00:43:14:14,00:43:16:05,Are you unhappy
1,2,521,00:43:17:01,00:43:19:22,that Cheonbugwan took the credit?
1,2,522,00:43:19:24,00:43:22:02,Songrim was the one who caught Naksu!
1,2,523,00:43:22:04,00:43:24:01,And you took credit for it!
1,2,524,00:43:26:09,00:43:28:07,We are not here to discuss that.
1,2,525,00:43:30:20,00:43:34:12,"As for the Gwanju position,
we will hold a mage meeting"
1,2,526,00:43:34:14,00:43:37:14,"and make a decision
once Jang Gang returns."
1,2,527,00:43:38:14,00:43:41:17,Please grant him a different reward.
1,2,528,00:43:45:05,00:43:46:11,Jin Mu.
1,2,529,00:43:48:10,00:43:50:05,Tell me what you desire.
1,2,530,00:43:53:02,00:43:55:00,The people are troubled by this sorcery.
1,2,531,00:43:55:02,00:43:57:12,"Allow me to burn
Naksu's body in front of Cheonbugwan."
1,2,532,00:43:57:14,00:43:58:19,As for Naksu's sword…
1,2,533,00:43:59:21,00:44:03:04,"Allow us to keep it
since Songrim has lost it once already."
1,2,534,00:44:06:15,00:44:08:07,You may do that.
1,2,535,00:44:17:13,00:44:21:17,"The best swords of the mages
have always been stored"
1,2,536,00:44:21:19,00:44:24:13,in the Sword Room of Jeongjingak.
1,2,537,00:44:25:16,00:44:28:02,"But things have changed
after that incident."
1,2,538,00:44:29:13,00:44:31:17,Jin Mu of Cheonbugwan took Naksu's sword?
1,2,539,00:44:31:19,00:44:35:09,Yes. He will burn Naksu's body there too.
1,2,540,00:44:35:11,00:44:38:01,"She will be there to witness
her body getting burned."
1,2,541,00:44:38:03,00:44:39:04,Who?
1,2,542,00:44:39:06,00:44:40:04,Naksu?
1,2,543,00:44:40:23,00:44:43:03,"Do you still think
Naksu has switched souls?"
1,2,544,00:44:44:07,00:44:46:20,"Are you serious
about accepting Naksu as your master?"
1,2,545,00:44:47:24,00:44:49:02,Forget it.
1,2,546,00:44:50:00,00:44:51:09,Pour me some more tea.
1,2,547,00:44:54:08,00:44:57:06,"You can do that yourself,"
1,2,548,00:44:57:09,00:44:58:22,lazybones.
1,2,549,00:45:01:18,00:45:04:07,"Where is your maid, Mudeoki?"
1,2,550,00:45:05:16,00:45:09:11,"I will find her.
But first, I need that sword."
1,2,551,00:45:16:13,00:45:19:03,"Seeing how he got rid
of everything that was mine,"
1,2,552,00:45:19:15,00:45:22:05,"he must think I failed
to switch souls and died."
1,2,553,00:45:23:19,00:45:26:16,"I cannot look for the Danju
since I do not know who he is."
1,2,554,00:45:35:06,00:45:38:00,"Find the merchant
who is selling a drawn Spirit Plaque,"
1,2,555,00:45:38:02,00:45:39:13,and you will find me.
1,2,556,00:45:40:02,00:45:41:10,I will be waiting.
1,2,557,00:46:04:03,00:46:05:14,That is Danhyanggok.
1,2,558,00:46:08:18,00:46:12:05,CHEONBUGWAN
1,2,559,00:46:12:07,00:46:14:00,I am here for Naksu's sword.
1,2,560,00:46:14:18,00:46:16:00,Why would you?
1,2,561,00:46:16:02,00:46:19:03,"I heard His Majesty allowed
Cheonbugwan to keep it."
1,2,562,00:46:19:05,00:46:22:18,"Since Jang Gang is the Gwanju,
it is right for his family to keep it."
1,2,563,00:46:22:20,00:46:24:01,"Since your father is not here,"
1,2,564,00:46:24:03,00:46:26:12,"it is only right that
the Assistant Gwanju keeps it."
1,2,565,00:46:29:23,00:46:33:13,"Since my father is not here,
I, his son, should keep it."
1,2,566,00:46:38:06,00:46:40:16,"I heard you are searching everywhere
for your master."
1,2,567,00:46:41:10,00:46:43:03,I would like to take you in myself.
1,2,568,00:46:43:20,00:46:46:12,"But I cannot defy your father's commands
since he was my master once."
1,2,569,00:46:48:04,00:46:51:06,"Why did he close
his own son's gate of energy?"
1,2,570,00:46:52:07,00:46:54:04,I just cannot fathom it.
1,2,571,00:46:58:21,00:47:01:06,"The mage's energy
flows through this sword."
1,2,572,00:47:01:09,00:47:05:11,"Someone as ordinary as you
will not be able to unsheathe it."
1,2,573,00:47:29:04,00:47:30:24,Are you afraid I will do it?
1,2,574,00:47:33:22,00:47:36:12,"If I unsheathe it,
I will be qualified as the next Gwanju."
1,2,575,00:47:36:14,00:47:39:11,"meaning you will be disqualified
from getting that position."
1,2,576,00:47:44:21,00:47:45:22,Do not worry.
1,2,577,00:47:46:17,00:47:48:01,I cannot unsheathe it for now.
1,2,578,00:48:00:00,00:48:01:05,"""For now""?"
1,2,579,00:48:05:02,00:48:07:19,"I saw firecrackers
coming from Danhyanggok."
1,2,580,00:48:07:21,00:48:09:17,Are you sure it was Danhyanggok?
1,2,581,00:48:09:19,00:48:10:15,"Yes, my lord."
1,2,582,00:48:10:16,00:48:13:05,"They came from the valley,
Naksu's former home."
1,2,583,00:48:33:02,00:48:35:01,"I am looking for the one
with the Spirit Plaque."
1,2,584,00:48:44:08,00:48:46:03,"Ma'am, they are here."
1,2,585,00:48:50:23,00:48:52:16,I guess someone wants to buy it.
1,2,586,00:48:58:06,00:49:00:02,"The very last room, please."
1,2,587,00:49:06:00,00:49:07:20,How could you lose it?
1,2,588,00:49:07:22,00:49:10:07,I did not lose it. Someone stole it.
1,2,589,00:49:10:09,00:49:11:21,I am certain it was Ae-hyang.
1,2,590,00:49:14:08,00:49:16:08,Are you the one who brought this?
1,2,591,00:49:18:20,00:49:21:02,I am here to buy the Spirit Plaque.
1,2,592,00:49:21:22,00:49:23:11,You have come to the right person.
1,2,593,00:49:30:17,00:49:32:12,She is no longer useful.
1,2,594,00:49:32:14,00:49:34:10,Kill her to avoid further problems.
1,2,595,00:49:46:18,00:49:47:19,"You know me, right?"
1,2,596,00:49:47:21,00:49:50:14,"I told you to let me know
if someone brought that drawing."
1,2,597,00:49:50:18,00:49:51:20,And I did.
1,2,598,00:49:52:08,00:49:54:13,She is meeting them upstairs.
1,2,599,00:49:55:10,00:49:57:16,So it was Ae-hyang.
1,2,600,00:50:02:22,00:50:04:11,We are mages from Cheonbugwan.
1,2,601,00:50:05:01,00:50:08:06,"We just caught a thief.
You can mind your own business."
1,2,602,00:50:14:11,00:50:15:15,He killed her.
1,2,603,00:50:16:17,00:50:18:05,He thought it was me.
1,2,604,00:50:47:10,00:50:49:14,The Danju has cut me off.
1,2,605,00:51:16:23,00:51:19:05,Is that truly you?
1,2,606,00:51:23:23,00:51:26:00,"-Begin.
-Yes, my lord."
1,2,607,00:51:52:08,00:51:55:00,"Cheonbugwan caught Naksu
when Songrim failed?"
1,2,608,00:51:55:02,00:51:57:12,Songrim was pretty much humiliated.
1,2,609,00:51:57:14,00:52:00:24,The Assistant Gwanju is over there.
1,2,610,00:52:01:01,00:52:02:09,You are right.
1,2,611,00:52:18:05,00:52:20:05,"So the Danju was Jin Mu,"
1,2,612,00:52:20:07,00:52:23:24,"the Assistant Gwanju
of the royal Cheonbugwan."
1,2,613,00:52:36:06,00:52:38:02,I am burning.
1,2,614,00:52:39:15,00:52:43:23,"Just like how my house
and parents burned on that day."
1,2,615,00:52:50:06,00:52:52:01,I will give you power.
1,2,616,00:52:52:03,00:52:53:20,Will you come with me?
1,2,617,00:53:32:00,00:53:33:05,Young Master Jang.
1,2,618,00:53:34:04,00:53:36:18,"As you can see, there is nothing I can do"
1,2,619,00:53:37:13,00:53:39:17,but watch my body burn.
1,2,620,00:53:41:13,00:53:43:12,There is nothing I can do for you either.
1,2,621,00:53:50:20,00:53:52:03,I found your sword.
1,2,622,00:53:59:16,00:54:01:24,"You said you could retrieve
your power with this."
1,2,623,00:54:08:24,00:54:12:00,"Why are you standing still?
Pick it up and unsheathe it."
1,2,624,00:54:29:24,00:54:32:12,An excellent blade recognizes its owner.
1,2,625,00:54:42:16,00:54:45:09,"Now, I just need to receive its energy."
1,2,626,00:55:21:23,00:55:24:05,You are too weak to handle
1,2,627,00:55:25:07,00:55:26:18,and unsheathe your own sword.
1,2,628,00:55:29:02,00:55:30:23,You are just as powerless as me.
1,2,629,00:55:31:23,00:55:33:06,We are useless.
1,2,630,00:55:38:13,00:55:41:02,That is enough. Forget it.
1,2,631,00:55:41:19,00:55:42:22,Just go.
1,2,632,00:55:48:15,00:55:52:11,"I doubt you will be a threat to Songrim,
and Naksu is already gone."
1,2,633,00:55:53:20,00:55:55:23,Just live as Mu-deok.
1,2,634,00:56:00:20,00:56:02:11,I would rather die…
1,2,635,00:56:06:16,00:56:08:01,than live like this.
1,2,636,00:56:10:15,00:56:12:07,Then be my guest.
1,2,637,00:57:04:11,00:57:06:10,This is the grave of the Soul Shifters.
1,2,638,00:57:07:12,00:57:10:00,The one who taught me this spell
1,2,639,00:57:10:02,00:57:12:16,also disposed of their bodies here.
1,2,640,00:57:23:14,00:57:24:17,So this will be
1,2,641,00:57:26:02,00:57:27:23,my grave as well.
1,2,642,00:57:55:17,00:57:59:09,"Young Master Jang,
how long should we keep this place closed?"
1,2,643,00:58:00:19,00:58:02:02,I am done now.
1,2,644,00:58:02:19,00:58:04:12,What is wrong with Mudeoki?
1,2,645,00:58:04:14,00:58:06:05,She seemed out of it.
1,2,646,00:58:10:11,00:58:11:17,I am just worried.
1,2,647,00:58:12:15,00:58:14:22,"She was heading
toward Lake Gyeongcheondaeho."
1,2,648,00:58:17:16,00:58:18:20,Lake Gyeongcheondaeho?
1,2,649,00:58:22:03,00:58:23:19,I would rather die…
1,2,650,00:58:25:14,00:58:26:19,than live like this.
1,2,651,00:58:26:21,00:58:28:08,Then be my guest.
1,2,652,00:59:41:24,00:59:43:02,Mu-deok!
1,2,653,00:59:44:02,00:59:45:04,Mu-deok!
1,2,654,00:59:49:20,00:59:50:22,Darn it…
1,2,655,01:00:49:04,01:00:52:16,"SEJUKWON, SONGRIM"
1,2,656,01:01:03:02,01:01:04:14,You are in Sejukwon.
1,2,657,01:01:05:13,01:01:07:08,Master Heo Yeom's infirmary in Songrim.
1,2,658,01:01:08:11,01:01:11:10,"Thanks to you, I could come here
even though I was once forbidden."
1,2,659,01:01:14:03,01:01:17:12,"Your eyes are probably sore.
I put in some eye drops."
1,2,660,01:01:18:09,01:01:21:08,"He said the blue marks in your eyes
were like bruises."
1,2,661,01:01:21:10,01:01:23:24,These eye drops will lighten their color.
1,2,662,01:01:24:14,01:01:25:16,Put them in regularly.
1,2,663,01:01:33:14,01:01:35:04,I unsheathed this before.
1,2,664,01:01:36:23,01:01:38:01,I definitely did.
1,2,665,01:01:38:03,01:01:39:16,I know. I saw it.
1,2,666,01:01:40:10,01:01:42:04,But you are still too weak.
1,2,667,01:01:42:07,01:01:44:13,"You could only do it
thanks to that lake's energy."
1,2,668,01:01:45:22,01:01:47:23,I had regained my power inside that lake.
1,2,669,01:01:49:14,01:01:50:21,I should go back there.
1,2,670,01:01:50:23,01:01:54:10,"Then what?
Will you live underwater like a fish?"
1,2,671,01:01:59:22,01:02:03:00,I felt a surge of energy underwater.
1,2,672,01:02:03:02,01:02:04:18,That is how I regained my power.
1,2,673,01:02:05:07,01:02:06:11,That is it.
1,2,674,01:02:07:13,01:02:10:00,"Someone who has energy
as powerful as that lake"
1,2,675,01:02:10:17,01:02:13:10,should push out the energy within me.
1,2,676,01:02:13:13,01:02:16:09,"And who exactly?
Will you be searching for a master too?"
1,2,677,01:02:17:00,01:02:20:04,"Do you think there is anyone
that powerful, to begin with?"
1,2,678,01:02:20:06,01:02:23:05,"Even if there was,
would they want to help you?"
1,2,679,01:02:24:10,01:02:26:10,"You are Naksu, an assassin
who shifted her soul."
1,2,680,01:02:29:14,01:02:30:12,What?
1,2,681,01:02:30:14,01:02:33:04,Uk came to Sejukwon?
1,2,682,01:02:33:18,01:02:35:23,He came to treat his maid who was injured.
1,2,683,01:02:36:00,01:02:37:16,He barged in.
1,2,684,01:02:37:18,01:02:38:22,His maid?
1,2,685,01:02:40:07,01:02:41:17,"Mu-deok, was it?"
1,2,686,01:02:41:19,01:02:43:06,How bad were her injuries
1,2,687,01:02:43:20,01:02:46:18,"that he would come
all the way here himself?"
1,2,688,01:03:02:21,01:03:04:24,I have only heard of Sejukwon.
1,2,689,01:03:05:20,01:03:07:11,It sure is an incredible infirmary.
1,2,690,01:03:08:15,01:03:10:11,There are all sorts of medicinal herbs.
1,2,691,01:03:11:01,01:03:12:12,And poisonous ones too.
1,2,692,01:03:18:06,01:03:22:00,"I am sure these eye drops
will make your eye color faint."
1,2,693,01:03:22:02,01:03:23:15,Lie low and live as Mu-deok.
1,2,694,01:03:24:12,01:03:26:00,This is all I can do for you.
1,2,695,01:03:26:02,01:03:27:09,You are wrong.
1,2,696,01:03:28:13,01:03:31:02,I want you to be my Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.
1,2,697,01:03:34:12,01:03:37:04,"You said you risked your life
many times for me."
1,2,698,01:03:38:10,01:03:40:03,Do it one more time.
1,2,699,01:03:46:15,01:03:47:22,It will be pretty painful.
1,2,700,01:03:55:07,01:03:56:16,What did you put in here?
1,2,701,01:03:59:00,01:04:01:00,One of the poisonous herbs.
1,2,702,01:04:07:20,01:04:09:15,I am betting everything on you.
1,2,703,01:04:11:17,01:04:14:16,So I hope you will survive.
1,2,704,01:04:31:02,01:04:32:10,"If you do,"
1,2,705,01:04:35:18,01:04:37:17,I will be your master.
1,2,706,01:04:47:13,01:04:49:04,Uk!
1,2,707,01:04:50:03,01:04:52:04,What is wrong? Uk!
1,2,708,01:04:52:06,01:04:53:08,Uk!
1,2,709,01:04:53:10,01:04:54:18,What is wrong with him?
1,2,710,01:04:55:08,01:04:56:11,He ingested poison.
1,2,711,01:04:58:04,01:04:59:17,"-Poison?
-What poison?"
1,2,712,01:04:59:19,01:05:03:08,His heart will stop in six hours.
1,2,713,01:05:03:09,01:05:04:14,What poison was it?
1,2,714,01:05:04:16,01:05:07:01,"It will be too late
by the time you find out"
1,2,715,01:05:07:03,01:05:08:22,and concoct an antidote.
1,2,716,01:05:08:24,01:05:11:13,There is only one way to save him.
1,2,717,01:05:11:15,01:05:12:23,Open his gate of energy
1,2,718,01:05:13:00,01:05:16:15,"and remove the poison
with both of your energy."
1,2,719,01:05:16:17,01:05:17:22,"-What?
-What?"
1,2,720,01:05:19:10,01:05:21:01,Open his gate of energy.
1,2,721,01:05:21:17,01:05:23:07,"Or else, he will die."
1,2,722,01:05:26:24,01:05:28:19,Yul…
1,2,723,01:05:29:12,01:05:31:06,Uk ingested poison.
1,2,724,01:05:32:02,01:05:33:08,They say he's going to die.
1,2,725,01:05:33:10,01:05:36:06,"-What?
-Mu-deok was the one who gave it to him."
1,2,726,01:05:36:08,01:05:38:18,"But she will not say
what kind of poison it was,"
1,2,727,01:05:38:20,01:05:41:14,so my uncle is torturing her right now.
1,2,728,01:05:47:06,01:05:48:21,What was the poison?
1,2,729,01:05:53:04,01:05:54:23,Keep going.
1,2,730,01:05:55:00,01:05:57:10,"-She could die, my lord.
-Uk is dying."
1,2,731,01:05:58:04,01:06:01:20,"We must find out what it is
in the next two hours."
1,2,732,01:06:08:06,01:06:09:08,Young Master Jang.
1,2,733,01:06:10:04,01:06:11:07,Young Master Jang…
1,2,734,01:06:13:09,01:06:14:14,Open his gate of energy.
1,2,735,01:06:15:20,01:06:17:16,That is the only way.
1,2,736,01:06:20:03,01:06:21:14,We are running out of time!
1,2,737,01:06:22:04,01:06:23:07,Please…
1,2,738,01:06:24:07,01:06:26:10,Please save Young Master Jang!
1,2,739,01:06:41:03,01:06:42:14,"-My lord.
-How is Uk?"
1,2,740,01:06:42:16,01:06:44:07,Did something happen to him?
1,2,741,01:06:44:09,01:06:46:07,Master Heo Yeom removed the poison.
1,2,742,01:06:46:22,01:06:48:10,Young Master Jang is safe.
1,2,743,01:06:49:00,01:06:51:14,"-Did he concoct the antidote?
-No, my lord."
1,2,744,01:06:52:08,01:06:55:10,"He opened
the young master's gate of energy."
1,2,745,01:07:20:24,01:07:23:19,"Young Master Jang, are you awake?"
1,2,746,01:07:35:23,01:07:37:21,Am I alive or dead?
1,2,747,01:07:39:02,01:07:40:20,You barely made it out alive.
1,2,748,01:07:40:22,01:07:42:10,Master Heo saved you
1,2,749,01:07:43:13,01:07:45:20,by opening your gate of energy.
1,2,750,01:07:48:05,01:07:49:22,He opened it?
1,2,751,01:07:49:24,01:07:51:11,Mu-deok that lunatic
1,2,752,01:07:52:03,01:07:55:03,"would not tell us
what kind of poison you took."
1,2,753,01:07:55:05,01:07:59:00,"So he had no choice
but to do that to remove the poison."
1,2,754,01:08:03:03,01:08:05:09,I am betting everything on you.
1,2,755,01:08:05:24,01:08:09:04,So I hope you will survive.
1,2,756,01:08:12:04,01:08:13:14,Where is Mu-deok?
1,2,757,01:08:32:15,01:08:33:18,Mu-deok…
1,2,758,01:08:40:10,01:08:41:16,Mu-deok!
1,2,759,01:08:52:05,01:08:53:08,Mu-deok.
1,2,760,01:08:56:16,01:08:57:21,Mu-deok.
1,2,761,01:09:02:08,01:09:03:10,Mu-deok.
1,2,762,01:09:18:00,01:09:19:18,Both of us could have died.
1,2,763,01:09:20:15,01:09:21:18,You are…
1,2,764,01:09:23:01,01:09:24:10,You are really crazy.
1,2,765,01:09:27:14,01:09:29:02,So you survived…
1,2,766,01:09:30:20,01:09:32:05,my pupil.
1,2,767,01:09:38:12,01:09:39:18,That is right.
1,2,768,01:09:41:16,01:09:43:11,I almost died thanks to you.
1,2,769,01:09:50:00,01:09:51:19,My crazy master.
