"I shall retrieve his soul.","Jang Gang","1","1"
"No! You were the one who turned my son into a soul shifter.","Geon's mother","1","1"
"If word gets out that I used forbidden sorcery, we will both be doomed.","Jang Gang","1","1"
"A crack forms when the bodies clash with the souls they carry, which causes them to lose energy.","Jang Gang","1","1"
"I guess I should stop shifting souls.","Jang Gang","1","1"
"The alchemy of souls. That is forbidden sorcery.","Jang Gang","1","1"
"The energy of the sky rules the wind, clouds, and rain. This energy reached the ground and created a huge form of energy. A country was built around Lake Gyeongcheondaeho, a lake that embodied that energy.","Jang Uk","1","1"
"Humans who had the power to control this great energy were called mages.","Jang Uk","1","1"
"This story is about the mages of Daeho, a place that does not exist in both history books or maps.","Jang Uk","1","1"
"They call me Naksu, for wherever I go, heads fall to the ground. A beautiful name, is it not?","Naksu","1","1"
"This mark shows that her soul has left the body. Remember this mark. When someone tries to switch bodies, it leaves a blue bruise like this right on top of their heart.","Heo Yeom","1","1"
"She seems to have tried, but I think she failed.","Park Jin","1","1"
"This proves that her soul has escaped her body, but we found no signs of her soul having entered another body.","Park Jin","1","1"
"She may have been an assassin who killed people like it was nothing, but she was still human. She must have had a story of her own.","Heo Yeom","1","1"
"Word will spread about the alchemy of souls.","Park Jin","1","1"
"Has it been 20 years since we have seen a soul shifter?","Heo Yeom","1","1"
"You seem awfully excited to start rumors.","Park Jin","1","1"
"Now that I have learned a big lesson, I would like to end it and leave.","Jang Uk","1","1"
"No one in this world will teach you spells because of your father.","Monk Ho-Yeong","1","1"
"I will find my own master. Someone extremely powerful and skilled.","Jang Uk","1","1"
"I should not switch bodies too soon. Let us stay as Mu-deok for now.","Mu-deok / Naksu","1","1"
"And they are called the Four Seasons. The daughter of the Jin family who has the vitality of spring: Jin Cho-yeon. The heir of the Park family who has the energy of a hot summer: Park Dang-gu. The genius of the Seo family who is as noble as the sunset in fall: Seo Yul. Then there is Jang Uk, the successor of the Jang family who is as dazzling as the winter snow.","Ju-Wol","1","1"
"The Jin, Park, Seo, and Jang family. They are the most well-known mage families in Daeho. Their children are known as the Four Seasons.","Ju-Wol","1","1"
"You flick energy with a blade just like how you flick water. A single strike is enough to kill someone.","Park Dang-Gu","1","1"
"Yes, she aimed at my vital point in just one go. But why did she roll off then? ","Jang Uk","1","1"
"You cannot even take out your own father's sword. How do you expect to learn spells?","Park Jin","1","1"
"No one in Daeho will be able to go against your father and open your gate of energy. ","Park Jin","1","1"
"Why would he decide my own fate?","Jang Uk","1","1"
"I will find someone myself. A master who will open my gate of energy and teach me how to practice spells. Then I will take out that sword and break it in two.","Jang Uk","1","1"
"I knew the moment I saw you. You are my master.","Jang Uk","1","1"
"The soul shifter Naksu, the Shadow Assassin, I have been searching for someone who can break this spell to call my master. I want you to be my master.","Jang Uk","1","1"
"I have blocked his gate of energy. He will not be able to learn any spells while he is alive.","Jang Gang","1","2"
"I forbid anyone from opening his gate of energy!","Jang Gang","1","2"
"And finally, I have met the master who will change my fate. I knew the moment I saw you. ","Jang Uk","1","2"
"I am planning to save you. You will not get caught if you stay by my side.","Jang Uk","1","2"
"How should you address me if you want to lie low? Young Master","Jang Uk","1","2"
"Only those of Songrim can break the barrier.","Park Jin","1","2"
"We could form a beautiful relationship where we benefit from each other.","Jang Uk","1","2"
"How merciless. After all, I helped you.","Jang Uk","1","2"
"Sorry that I am so merciless for such a cute face.","Mu-deok / Naksu","1","2"
"I thought you were pretending to be clumsy.","Jang Uk","1","2"
"Taking sides? Are you seriously that childish?","Mu-deok / Naksu","1","2"
"Why are you talking casually in this situation?","Jang Uk","1","2"
"The alchemy of souls, a type of sorcery, has one weakness. There is a gap between the body and the soul. The evil energy seeps out from it. And Gwigu can detect that. ","Park Dang-Gu","1","2"
"Uk, feign ignorance even if I get caught.","Mu-deok / Naksu","1","2"
"Stay right by my side. No one here will let that thing attack me.","Jang Uk","1","2"
"I see. How evil. ","Jang Uk","1","2"
"By the way, you have the habit of glaring at others. Keep doing that, and you will get caught.","Jang Uk","1","2"
"Anyone who came that close to me died in my hands.","Mu-deok / Naksu","1","2"
"But what kind of an heirloom is this fragile?","Jang Uk","1","2"
"Then open his gate of energy for him. He desperately wants it. You are his friends. ","Mu-deok / Naksu","1","2"
"Then he is already being punished for his entire lifetime.","Mu-deok / Naksu","1","2"
"The people I have met so far only wanted me dead. You are the first person who tried to save me.","Mu-deok / Naksu","1","2"
"Even if we meet again and come this close to each other, I will spare you.","Mu-deok / Naksu","1","2"
"I am betting everything on you. So I hope you will survive. ","Mu-deok / Naksu","1","2"
"He ingested poison. His heart will stop in six hours. It will be too late by the time you find out and concoct an antidote. There is only one way to save him. Open his gate of energy. Or else, he will die. ","Mu-deok / Naksu","1","2"
"Mu-deok. Both of us could have died. You are… You are really crazy. ","Jang Uk","1","2"
"So you survived, my pupil. ","Mu-deok / Naksu","1","2"
"That is right. I almost died thanks to you. My crazy master.","Jang Uk","1","2"
"Believe what you wish to believe.","Jang Gang","1","3"
"See? He is your son. A son you are willing to protect even at the risk of your own life.","Park Jin","1","3"
"I am merely trying to keep him safe.","Jang Gang","1","3"
"Not only does his birth make no sense, but it never should have happened either. ","Jang Gang","1","3"
"She did not poison me. I poisoned myself. Please help. Mu-deok risked her life to do what I asked.","Jang Uk","1","3"
"She risked her life for him even though they only just met. It is strange.","Seo Yul","1","3"
"She easily deceives people. She did not speak even though she was tortured. ","Seo Yul","1","3"
"There is more to her than meets the eye.","Park Dang-Gu","1","3"
"The people of Songrim are too nice. If this is how they torture people… ","Mu-deok / Naksu","1","3"
"I am the only person who is safe enough to come this close to you.","Jang Uk","1","3"
"All my life, no one ever seemed to know how desperate I was. No one has ever risked their lives for me like you did. ","Jang Uk","1","3"
"People think I got kicked out every time, but I was the one who left.","Jang Uk","1","3"
"The moment I get my energy back and become Naksu again, we will no longer be master and pupil. Because then, you should no longer have a reason to protect me, nor should I have a reason to go easy on you. ","Mu-deok / Naksu","1","3"
"I, Jang Uk, your pupil, will serve and protect my master, Mu-deok, with all my heart. ","Jang Uk","1","3"
"If you master your spells, you will neither feel cold on ice nor hot walking on fire. ","Mu-deok / Naksu","1","3"
"In order to become the best mage, you must go through several steps.","Mu-deok / Naksu","1","3"
"First is Jipsu, the ability to gather the energy of water. Second is Ryusu, the ability to gain energy from the flow of water. Then comes Chisu, the ability to control the energy in the atmosphere. ","Mu-deok / Naksu","1","3"
"I did not feel motivated to do so. As you already know, I need to feel motivated in order to do something.","Jang Uk","1","3"
"I am a quick learner. I will quickly master Jipsu. How long does it take?","Jang Uk","1","3"
"He was a genius who only took a year to master Jipsu.","Mu-deok / Naksu","1","3"
"If he took a year, I will do it in six months. No, I will do it in three months. ","Jang Uk","1","3"
"I am determined, so do not discourage me.","Jang Uk","1","3"
"Please do not resent me for that.","Park Jin","1","3"
"It is normal to pick on the weak. That is how the world works.","Mu-deok / Naksu","1","3"
"This wine was made with spring water from a volcanic island in Southern Daeho. It is dark wine, the best wine you can find in Daeho. This is a rare delicacy.","Kim Do-Joo","1","3"
"You will have to take your sister's place and become the leader that guards Jinyowon for the family. Find a man who will support your cause.","Lady Jin","1","3"
"If he is not busy, he normally sleeps early and wakes up early too. ","Park Dang-Gu","1","3"
"I lived a harsh life, so I learned a few moves just to keep myself safe. ","Mu-deok / Naksu","1","3"
"Your mother, Do-hwa, was extremely kind-hearted. Always remember that and ignore what everyone else says.","Heo Yeom","1","3"
"So be careful who you fall for. Only I get to come this close.","Jang Uk","1","3"
"Fine. I will only allow it to you.","Mu-deok / Naksu","1","3"
"What? Why does that require effort? ","Jang Uk","1","3"
"Why not? It makes no sense. Come on. Humor me. ","Jang Uk","1","3"
"His existence will bring chaos. He should not attract attention or challenge anyone. We must make people think that he is nothing special.","Jang Gang","1","3"
"I was abandoned from the moment I was born. And this is not my first time getting kicked out. It does not faze me. ","Jang Uk","1","4"
"The alchemy of souls was not a type of sorcery from the start. You can only perform this once you have mastered Jipsu, Ryusu, Chisu, and ultimately, Hwansu. ","Heo Yeom","1","4"
"Hwansu is the godlike power of changing water to fire and vice versa. Is it not? Humans cannot reach that level. Right? ","Park Dang-Gu","1","4"
"I want to unsheathe it and show them. Is that an act of stupidity?","Jang Uk","1","4"
"I see. You are going to give him some medicine before nitpicking at him.","Park Dang-Gu","1","4"
"I am sure you expected me to grovel in humiliation. Going against you would be an act of stupidity. However, there is someone who sees it as one of vigor. So I shall try. ","Jang Uk","1","4"
"Then what? Should I just leave? You should have stopped me before I started. ","Prince Go Won","1","4"
"I am the Assistant Gwanju. I would appreciate it if you showed more respect.","Jin Mu","1","4"
"You are intelligent and pick up things quickly.","Park Jin","1","4"
"Just stay a clueless Young Master of the Jang family. ","Park Jin","1","4"
"Did he scold you again? I thought you were used to being scolded… ","Mu-deok / Naksu","1","4"
"Why did you not dodge his blade? Was it because you needed another reason to kick him out?","Kim Do-Joo","1","4"
"Breaking his heart must be more painful than getting stabbed.","Kim Do-Joo","1","4"
"You have put him in danger once again.","Seo Yul","1","4"
"I will give you power. Will you come with me?","Jin Mu","1","5"
"I do not know if I toughened up to survive or if I survived because I was tough. ","Mu-deok / Naksu","1","5"
"This is a place so rugged and remote that even echoes cannot be heard. Hence the name, Danhyanggok.","Mu-deok / Naksu","1","5"
"A crack has formed and damaged the stability and peace that had existed between the royal family and mages. ","King Go Soon","1","5"
"A small amount of energy created immense strength.","Mu-deok / Naksu","1","5"
"Who are you to stop me from enjoying my peace?","Jang Uk","1","5"
"(Jang Uk) Once I put my mind to something, I tend to learn very fast. (Master Lee) I like you even more now.","Jang Uk & Master Lee","1","5"
"She has no blue mark. Is she really not Naksu?","Gil-Ju","1","5"
"Relieve yourself of everything you have wanted to say but could not, thinking it might make you seem petty. ","Mu-deok / Naksu","1","5"
"(Go Won) Are you offering to be a verbal outhouse of sorts? (Mu-deok) Goodness, that would be too grand of a title for me.","Prince Go Won & Mu-deok","1","5"
"Mu-deok is like a bird's egg. She needs to be embraced.","Jang Uk","1","5"
"(Jang Uk) Is that level even possible for a human being to master? (Master Lee) Of course. ","Jang Uk & Master Lee","1","5"
"If I ever happen to get caught by them, do not try to save me.","Mu-deok / Naksu","1","5"
"I wanted to do nothing, but I feel motivated to climb this tree.","Jang Uk","1","5"
"I could not ask her why. The moment she sliced my sincerity in half, I could no longer cherish our memories together. ","Seo Yul","1","6"
"That is the type of girl she is. She does not easily like or feel shy in front of others.","Jang Uk","1","6"
"I did not know my pupil was this possessive. Fine. My one and only pupil will be you who spews nonsense first thing in the morning. Happy? ","Mu-deok / Naksu","1","6"
"No, thank you. I do not want to climb such a special tree with just anyone. ","Mu-deok / Naksu","1","6"
"Have I ever listened to anyone? Tell him I am doing the very opposite and being reckless. ","Jang Uk","1","6"
"I would not hesitate to stab you with a sword if that could get you back on your feet.","Mu-deok / Naksu","1","6"
"Is he trying to run before learning to walk?","Master Lee","1","6"
"Yes, I do. I truly want to. I will get married at all costs. Wait up. ","Jang Uk","1","6"
"Yes. That is what I believed all my life. I do not want to deny it now. So… I will not sit still. Do not stop me no matter what I do.","Jang Uk","1","6"
"Eventually, that boundless power ended up causing chaos. In order to possess the unmelting ice that produced the Soul Ejector, the battle of mages turned into bloodshed, and Daeho became a living hell.  ","Master Lee","1","7"
"Yul is always so calm, but he can be a scatterbrain when he is startled too.","Prince Go Won","1","7"
"That is right. I am an illusion. An illusion that reflects who you are. Humans are incapable of seeing themselves with their own eyes. The only way is to see themselves through a mirror. So the perception you have about yourself is nothing but an illusion.The same goes for how others perceive you. They only see what they want to see and create an illusion that suits them.","The Mirror of Longing","1","7"
"If there is nothing to reflect, a mirror becomes useless. ","Jang Uk","1","7"
"When you have a lot to protect, you sometimes have no choice but to be heartless. ","Park Jin","1","7"
"The mirror I saw inside Jinyowon told me that people only see what they wish to see. That it is an illusion. All my life, I tried so hard to prove to everyone that I was my father's son. But… you told me I was not. Though it hurt, it got rid of my illusion.","Jang Uk","1","7"
"(Mu-deok / Naksu) Your master is neither strong enough to pull you up nor support you from the bottom. (Jang Uk) You were never like that to begin with. You always pushed me to my death. But whenever you did that, I found myself on a whole new level. Keep doing that and stay by my side.","Mu-deok / Naksu & Jang Uk","1","8"
"First, do not do anything and just defend. If you make the first move with your current skills, you will die. You must only attack him when he loses his focus.","Mu-deok / Naksu","1","8"
"The reason you get lost when you have a lot on your mind is that you are focused on too many things. When that happens, just try to focus on one thing.","Mu-deok / Naksu","1","9"
"You always circled those words, never saying them out loud.","Kim Do-Joo","1","9"
"Must you say your feelings out loud? You should just be able to tell.","Park Jin","1","9"
"All living things in this world have energy. And detecting energy is how I see the world.","Jin Bu-Yeon","1","9"
"I was wondering why he agreed to obey the rules. He had his reasons.","Park Dang-Gu","1","10"
"So you did not take him under your wing. You just locked him up in Songrim.","Heo Yeom","1","10"
"I rarely go out when it is raining. I had hurt my leg as a child, and it still hurts when it rains.","Seo Yul","1","10"
"But I will not be able to if we break up today. Up until now, I stayed home for at least a month after breaking off an engagement.","Jin Cho-Yeon","1","10"
"I do not understand why I am being nice to him.","Prince Go Won","1","10"
"Countless mages have read this, but no one knows that fact. Master Seo Gyeong wrote this for a lady who could not see so that she could read it with her heart. You can read it by training your concentration skills.","Master Lee","1","10"
"You cannot grasp water, but it is inside the soil. You cannot touch fire, but it is inside the tree. You cannot hold the wind, but it is resting on the rock. If you let them be, they will exist everywhere. The faint, blue light makes me sigh. My white breath turned into snow and tears. I could not let them drop and hid them. Despite knowing that they will fill up once again, I am a fool who dares not shed a single tear.","Words of the Heart","1","10"
"No matter how pathetic you feel, you must do what you can at the moment. If I am not willing to do anything, I might as well just die.","Mu-deok / Naksu","1","10"
"I should have braced myself before letting him get this close to me. What I gave him should not have been read or delivered in the first place. It was my foolish and pathetic love letter.","Mu-deok / Naksu","1","10"
"Some things are hard to see because they are hidden, not because they do not exist.","Jang Uk","1","11"
"Just as you saw my blue mark and found out I was a soul shifter, you have once again caught me. You have found another weakness of mine.","Mu-deok / Naksu","1","11"
"I do not know much about love, but when you truly love someone, you will not need to say it that often. Because it will be hard just to say it once.","Seo Yul","1","11"
"Gwanju Jang Gang performed the alchemy of souls. Because of that, a child that should not have been born was born. And that night, the King's Star was in the night sky.","Park Jin","1","11"
"If that is what Master Lee wants, we will store Words of the Heart safely in Jinyowon.","Lady Jin","1","11"
"My eldest daughter might still be alive. Although she could not see, she could feel energy and could control relics like no other.","Lady Jin","1","11"
"He got lucky and beat me by using Tansu. It was not because he was skilled.","Prince Go Won","1","11"
"You were willing to give up on becoming Songrim's heir because of me?","Jin Cho-Yeon","1","11"
"You said you did not want a loveless marriage. I figured if I married you, you would at least marry a man that loved you.","Park Dang-Gu","1","11"
"Young Master Jang can be blunt due to his past scars. But after he opens up to someone, he is very kind and warm.","Kim Do-Joo","1","11"
"The ice stone may seem like it is made of ice, but it also has the nature of fire, water, and wind.","Master Lee","1","11"
"Fight and perish, Jang Uk. All the pain that does not kill you, will only make you stronger.","Mu-deok / Naksu","1","11"
"There should be a red jade that goes with it. They are only valuable when they are together.","Jin Mu","1","11"
"Uk may be losing, but he is improving.","Seo Yul","1","12"
"Had you suddenly taken a step back after landing those blows, he would have been relieved, stopped defending, and let down his guard. Fighting is like a game of tug-of-war.","Mu-deok / Naksu","1","12"
"Are you saying he took that little girl and turned her into an assassin?","Master Lee","1","12"
"I took care of her just enough for her to survive. But she was determined and grew to be remarkably strong.","Jin Mu","1","12"
"Once Jin Mu heard that we were after her, he was probably afraid of getting caught. He probably sent Naksu to Songrim despite knowing that she would die.","Park Jin","1","12"
"She was used for all the wrong reasons and met a terrible death. Naksu… I truly pity her.","Master Lee","1","12"
"If they hide their blue mark, they can easily blend in with other people. But once they run wild, there is no turning back. They will start to petrify as their energy seeps out. They can prevent that by feeding on others' energy. But once they do that, they will no longer be humans, but monsters. And it is our duty to protect this world from such monsters.","Seo Yul","1","12"
"We can also protect the monsters from this world. Once we keep them in check, the world will be at peace.","Jang Uk","1","12"
"Everyone had high hopes for you ever since you were little, so you think you need to do something grand. But I was told to sit still all my life. I will follow my heart.","Jang Uk","1","12"
"We must strengthen Songrim's boundaries. You are forbidden from leaving Songrim for the time being. Those who have mastered Ryusu and more shall go to Sejukwon and follow Sang-ho's orders.","Park Jin","1","12"
"Here, at Cheonbugwan, we have records of all the constellations.","Cho Chung","1","12"
"Tell him that we use a lot of oil in our honey biscuits and that he should have them with green tea.","Jang Uk","1","12"
"Come to think of it, I believe he recorded the constellation on the day you were born.","Mu-deok / Naksu","1","12"
"You are no longer needed. You will turn into a stone now.","Jin Mu","1","12"
"Eunuch Kim has run wild. No one must find out that he is a soul shifter.","Jin Mu","1","12"
"So you were the maid who always stuck by his side and caused a nuisance.","Jin Mu","1","12"
"Master, help me once again. Give your hesitant pupil confidence.","Jang Uk","1","12"
"Jin Bu-yeon. If she were alive, she would have become a great priestess who could even control the energy of the skies. ","Jin Mu","1","13"
"You cannot judge what is right or wrong merely based on the things you see. There are stories to everything. And fate is made up of many stories and relationships.","Master Lee","1","13"
"The leader of Songrim and Assistant Gwanju of Cheonbugwan fighting over honey biscuits?","Prince Go Won","1","13"
"If you try to hold on, people let go. If you let go, people try to hold on.","Mu-deok / Naksu","1","13"
"He was just an average boy with nothing special about him. He was angry at the world, and he hid his helplessness and indolence by putting on a cold-hearted mask. He never did anything with a goal. He was just a young master who was full of himself, so all one ever had to do was appease him. ","Jin Mu","1","13"
"People change, because of other people. Find out who showed up just when he began to change. That will be your answer.","Shaman Choi","1","13"
"That feeling of catching a Golden Fish as you control the energy of Lake Gyeongcheondaeho… It is ecstatic.","Master Lee","1","13"
"We, the people of Jinyowon, do not take orders from Songrim.","Lady Jin ","1","13"
"My feelings for her are not worldly. I just think she is beautiful and warm-hearted. That is all there is to it.","Master Lee","1","13"
"Well, as for me… I do like her. I cannot believe I am talking about this with a man who practices chastity.","Jang Uk","1","13"
"If I had not left you there in the mountains, you would not have to suffer this fate where you have to hold your tears and pretend to be someone else. But even now, I cannot seem to step up and tell you that I know who you really are.","Seo Yul","1","13"
"Uk, I will be returning to Seoho Fortress soon. I promised my father that I would only train at Jeongjingak until I mastered Chisu.","Seo Yul","1","13"
"He is stubborn about things no matter what others tell him. But he always listens to Mu-deok.","Park Dang-Gu","1","14"
"It took us over ten years to finally grasp this energy. But there are those who can do that from birth. Simply put, they are geniuses. But to the world, they seem reckless, unreliable, and even dangerous at times. That is because they are different from the rest of us. Some could be jealous of them. While others could be worried about them. We react that way because we do not know how they will use their terrifying powers.","Master Lee","1","14"
"I love that you are persistent and smart. But that is also what makes you dangerous.","Jin Mu","1","14"
"You can erase that black ink with white rice. The two colors may contrast one another. But mix them together, and they will get rid of that stain.","Prince Go Won","1","14"
"Understanding you is much harder than controlling Lake Gyeongcheondaeho's energy. You were pulling me in, were you not?","Jang Uk","1","14"
"Since they are shamelessly hiding it, I have decided to be brazen as well and make my move.","Master Lee","1","14"
"Does this mean there is a soul shifter inside my palace?","King Go Soon","1","15"
"The son of Cheonbugwan's Gwanju should be protecting the royal family, but you brought in a wily beast instead.","Jin Mu","1","15"
"I was told that Master Seo Gyeong destroyed all the ice stones 200 years ago after the Great Chaos.","Jin Mu","1","15"
"It is not easy to quell human desires.","Master Lee","1","15"
"A power strong enough to defy the laws of nature and bring chaos to the world has returned once again. Thus, someone strong enough to stop it should also appear. That way, the world will be able to maintain balance.","Master Lee","1","15"
"Naksu may have been an assassin, but she never hurt ordinary people.","Seo Yul","1","15"
"Naksu's body was burned, and they all know that it was done by those with power and authority. Calling them fools when they are actually scared is negligence.","Jang Uk","1","15"
"Your embarrassment will only be temporary, but I could really get killed for this.","Mu-deok / Naksu","1","15"
"You did not need to bring gifts to apologize for the past.","Lady Jin","1","15"
"To be acknowledged as the daughter of the Jin family, you must open the door to Jinyowon.","Jin Mu","1","15"
"A secret that ensures that we say the same thing.","Jang Uk","1","15"
"If something like this ever happens again, and you find yourself in a life or death situation, give up on love and choose your life. That is an order from your master.","Mu-deok / Naksu","1","15"
"What if I do not mind dying? Then can I hold onto it and keep loving you?","Jang Uk","1","15"
"I told you that I am willing to risk it all and that we are in this together. I will keep going no matter what. So you should do the same and stick to your confession. Keep loving me to death.","Jang Uk","1","15"
"Master Lee knew that you were a soul shifter from the beginning. Perhaps, he even knows you are Naksu.","Jang Uk","1","16"
"I heard that you took Gwigu, a relic of Jinyowon, to the palace today.","Lady Jin","1","16"
"So this dog was Gwigu. It must have known that I was a soul shifter from the beginning. But it never barked at me. Was it covering for me too?","Mu-deok / Naksu","1","16"
"The rumors about soul shifters have spread throughout Daeho Fortress. If he hears the rumors, he will return, fearing for Songrim and for his son.","Park Jin","1","16"
"He is merciless towards those who stray.","Heo Yeom","1","16"
"And if you must draw and point that sword at someone, point it at me before at anyone else. If you stab me, then I will die as the one who released the assassin.","Jang Uk","1","16"
"The heart is the most important. If you are in love, appearances do not matter.","Kim Do-Joo","1","16"
"My sister was her pride and joy. Even though she was blind, she could see energy and handle relics. Even at a young age, her abilities were as powerful as my mother's.","Jin Cho-Yeon","1","16"
"Well, I heard that the Jin family members are born with more divine powers than spell-related powers.","Mu-deok / Naksu","1","16"
