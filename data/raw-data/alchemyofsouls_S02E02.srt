00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:44,962
ALCHEMY OF SOULS
PART 2

2
00:00:57,975 --> 00:00:59,055
She is nowhere to be found.

3
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:03,188
- Bu-yeon's boat is the only one missing?
- Yes.

4
00:01:04,772 --> 00:01:08,150
Does that mean someone
purposely kidnapped the bride?

5
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,614
Who would do such a thing?

6
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:16,950
Let us go.

7
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:19,287
Sure.

8
00:01:38,347 --> 00:01:40,141
I am very happy that you came.

9
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:48,400
What are you doing?

10
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,984
Are you not going to carry me?

11
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,487
- Can you not walk?
- Of course, I can.

12
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:55,240
But people will come looking for me.

13
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:58,534
It would be much faster to cast a spell
and run with me in your arms.

14
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,453
If that is what you are worried about,

15
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,081
do not worry and just walk.

16
00:02:10,963 --> 00:02:12,716
You are the strongest man in Daeho.

17
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,009
Carrying me would be
a piece of cake for you.

18
00:02:16,927 --> 00:02:18,972
I do not want to waste my energy.

19
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:20,723
Besides, you do not look that light.

20
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:23,393
That is because I am wearing layers.

21
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,295
It is difficult to walk with this.

22
00:02:28,522 --> 00:02:29,524
Thenâ€¦

23
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,735
- take it off.
- Here?

24
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,028
Yes, take it off.

25
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,406
I meanâ€¦

26
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,911
this does seem
like a pretty deserted place.

27
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:46,040
I get that you are impatient,
but doing it here seems inappropriate.

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,293
Do you not think so?

29
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:53,215
After all, this is
our first night together.

30
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:56,218
Unbelievable. Listen.

31
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:58,969
I was telling you
to take off that impractical robe.

32
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:00,055
Why in the worldâ€¦

33
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,641
- would I want to do anything here?
- Right?

34
00:03:03,724 --> 00:03:04,810
I apologize.

35
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:08,104
I am just really anxious.
I must have gotten ahead of myself.

36
00:03:09,563 --> 00:03:10,689
Hey, wait.

37
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:13,401
Do not worry.
I am only taking off this robe.

38
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:19,615
Are you sure you were not locked up
because you hurt your head?

39
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,367
No, but I was ill.

40
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:24,371
I was on the verge of death,

41
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,081
but my mother found me and treated me.

42
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,000
Why were you ill?

43
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:32,420
To be frank,
I do not know what it was myself.

44
00:03:33,045 --> 00:03:34,463
Once I regained consciousness,

45
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:37,175
I was already a lot better.

46
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:40,637
How could you not know?

47
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:43,432
You may not remember anything
from when you were unconscious,

48
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:45,099
but what about before that?

49
00:03:45,891 --> 00:03:47,978
Was it because you got hurt,
or was it an illness?

50
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:50,521
You see,

51
00:03:51,647 --> 00:03:53,483
I remember nothing before Jinyowon.

52
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:55,860
I lost all my memories when I was ill.

53
00:03:58,237 --> 00:04:00,073
My condition is the reason

54
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,616
why my mother kept me a secretâ€¦

55
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:05,786
and hidden from everyone.

56
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:21,845
No one knows of Bu-yeon's existence.

57
00:04:21,927 --> 00:04:23,680
Who could have taken her?

58
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,432
Park Dang-go of Songrim

59
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,101
knew about Jinyowon's wedding ceremony.

60
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,771
Perhaps he thought it was my wedding

61
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:34,899
and stole the boat carrying the bride,
hoping to ruin the ceremony.

62
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,909
The person from Jinyowon getting married

63
00:04:44,992 --> 00:04:47,204
is Jin Bu-yeon, not Jin Cho-yeon?

64
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,247
Yes.

65
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,917
She and my Uncle Yun-o,
who came with me from Seoho Fortress,

66
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,252
are having the wedding ceremony in secret.

67
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:59,048
I am only telling you
because you will not stop crying.

68
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:04,386
Here.

69
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:06,514
Thank you.

70
00:05:12,394 --> 00:05:14,064
Thank goodness it is not Cho-yeon.

71
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,231
But wait a minute.

72
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,401
Jin Bu-yeon is actually alive?

73
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,112
Have you met her?

74
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:24,240
- What is she like?
- I have not met her yet.

75
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:28,661
Uncle Yun-o said he would
introduce her to me after the wedding.

76
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,353
I guess I will know once I meet her.

77
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,255
I was told Jin Bu-yeon was blind,
but you are not.

78
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:40,338
That is also strange.

79
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,800
Apparently, I was when I was little,

80
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,761
but my sight came back after I recovered.

81
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:46,930
I remember none of that, though.

82
00:06:07,324 --> 00:06:08,701
- What?
- You do not have it.

83
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,663
I do not have what?

84
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,611
The blue mark of a soul shifter.

85
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,420
The energy sometimes enters the eyes
and enables a blind person to see.

86
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,780
But I guess that was not the case.

87
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,429
I thought they were found
on the left shoulder.

88
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,210
Some have them in their eyes?

89
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:26,759
Yes.

90
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:29,014
I have never heard of such a thing.

91
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,391
I am the only one who has seen it.

92
00:06:32,766 --> 00:06:35,728
That makes sense since you are a mage
who hunts down soul shifters.

93
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,972
You must have killed
the infamous soul shifter as well.

94
00:06:44,653 --> 00:06:46,615
What is it? Did you fail to catch her?

95
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,619
- She died.
- "She died"?

96
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:53,704
Was it not you who killed her?

97
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,336
I guess not.

98
00:07:00,127 --> 00:07:02,047
Did you know her? Were you close?

99
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:03,589
You ask too many questions.

100
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,761
I told you my story,
so I just wanted to hear yours.

101
00:07:07,843 --> 00:07:09,803
I know I picked you
to be my husband on a whim,

102
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,057
but I would like to get to know you.

103
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:14,225
You could not stop praising me
when you wanted me,

104
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,937
but are you getting picky
now that I am here?

105
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:19,480
I just want to know more about you.
Is that so bad?

106
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:22,942
So you can leave me
if you find me insufficient?

107
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,235
I thought you wanted someone

108
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,613
who could defy your mother
and help you escape.

109
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:30,908
If it is a loving husband
you are looking for

110
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,577
instead of a means to escape,
then let us say goodbye now.

111
00:07:34,536 --> 00:07:36,706
I will send you back on the boat
to where you were.

112
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:43,129
No way.

113
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:45,673
As long as you free me
from that sickening cell,

114
00:07:47,007 --> 00:07:48,718
I will stay with you no matter what.

115
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:51,178
You can be a thug for all I care.

116
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,004
Fortunately, I am not that bad.

117
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,156
I will still be reasonable. Do not worry.

118
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,519
Butâ€¦

119
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:00,730
Why did you come for me?

120
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,149
You obviously are not smitten with me,

121
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,026
and you do not seem to pity me either.

122
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:10,447
What is it that you need me for?

123
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:17,829
You told me that

124
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:20,000
you could see the energy inside me.

125
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,375
What you are seeing

126
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,127
is the ice stone.

127
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:28,550
Ice stone?

128
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:31,052
Long ago, Jin Bu-yeon found the ice stone

129
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:33,763
that was lying at the bottom
of Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.

130
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:37,057
- Me?
- You do not need to remember.

131
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:39,184
I just need your great divine powers.

132
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:40,937
That is why I need you.

133
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:50,779
My divine powers?

134
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,017
<i><font color="white">It is the ice stone.</font></i>

135
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,101
<i><font color="white">He possesses the ice stone.</font></i>

136
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,479
<i><font color="white">They say Jang Uk is</font></i>

137
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:48,815
<i><font color="white">always followed by wraiths and grotesques.</font></i>

138
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:53,403
That must be why every time I meet him,
it sends a shiver down my spine.

139
00:10:53,485 --> 00:10:56,739
Then do not listen to Master Lee
and stop visiting him.

140
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,826
He still bothers me, though.

141
00:10:59,908 --> 00:11:02,077
I get curious
about how he is doing as well.

142
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:05,748
Jang Uk cannot use that power
for his own personal use.

143
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,083
If he ever does,

144
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,211
Park Jin will have to give up his life.

145
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:12,480
He gave his word to the royal family
and Unanimous Assembly

146
00:11:12,504 --> 00:11:14,591
as he stepped down
from the leader position.

147
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:19,303
And I have you to thank
for helping me keep Jang Uk

148
00:11:20,804 --> 00:11:22,222
in the palm of my hand.

149
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:25,726
I am grateful for your acknowledgment.

150
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,813
Just think of Jang Uk as a tool

151
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:32,357
that helps you utilize
the energy of the sky.

152
00:11:42,659 --> 00:11:43,745
<i><font color="white">Did Jin Mu tell you</font></i>

153
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:46,246
<i><font color="white">to think that of me
to make you feel better?</font></i>

154
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:55,672
Uncle Yun-o.

155
00:11:56,256 --> 00:11:58,467
Were you not supposed
to get married tonight?

156
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:00,802
I could not.

157
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,304
Someone stole my bride.

158
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:06,433
Park Dang-go,
the newly appointed leader of Songrim,

159
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:10,104
thought I was marrying Jin Cho-yeon
and kidnapped the bride.

160
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:14,732
Iâ€¦

161
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:17,653
did what?

162
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,870
I am here to retrieve
what Park Dang-go has stolen from me.

163
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:28,373
Find and bring him here this instant.

164
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,957
What exactly

165
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,585
did our leader steal from Jinyowon?

166
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:36,254
You cannot just come here
in the middle of the night

167
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:38,131
and demand what you want.

168
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:40,051
Have you no manners?

169
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,427
If you do not cooperate,
I will find him myself.

170
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,307
Search all of Songrim
and find Park Dang-go.

171
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,390
Lady Jin.

172
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,273
Lord Dang-go is here.

173
00:13:01,154 --> 00:13:03,783
Lady Jin, do not be mistaken.
It was not me.

174
00:13:04,616 --> 00:13:06,869
I did not kidnap the bride
on her way to the wedding.

175
00:13:07,452 --> 00:13:08,452
"Wedding"?

176
00:13:09,621 --> 00:13:10,498
"Bride"?

177
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,500
You knew about Jinyowon's wedding ceremony

178
00:13:12,582 --> 00:13:14,342
and went around asking about it,
did you not?

179
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:18,630
Yes, that I did.

180
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,759
I thought it was for Young Lady Jin.

181
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,513
Although I wanted to ruin the ceremony,

182
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:26,972
I did not.

183
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,976
Dang-go was with me all night.

184
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:32,812
He was not the personâ€¦

185
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:36,816
who kidnapped Jin Bu-yeon.

186
00:13:41,778 --> 00:13:45,198
Are you saying you came here

187
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:49,037
looking for your eldest daughter,
Jin Bu-yeon?

188
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:53,457
My goodness, this is so confusing.

189
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,375
What is this about Jin Bu-yeon?

190
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,918
That girl is dead!

191
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:57,836
Cho-yeon.

192
00:13:57,919 --> 00:13:59,337
Explain to me what is going on.

193
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,591
Well, the thing isâ€¦

194
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,429
My sister is alive.

195
00:14:08,346 --> 00:14:11,142
She has been living in Jinyowon
for the last three years.

196
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,643
What? She is alive?

197
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:15,772
Yes, that is right.
I came here looking for Bu-yeon.

198
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:18,857
She disappeared today
during her wedding ceremony.

199
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:23,071
I was too flustered
having lost my precious daughter.

200
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:24,976
I apologize for the discourtesy.

201
00:14:25,405 --> 00:14:27,075
I will be off now.

202
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:47,594
Jin Bu-yeon.

203
00:14:49,596 --> 00:14:50,681
So you are alive.

204
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,772
Why was Young Lady Jin so angry?

205
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,856
She probably felt embarrassed and upset

206
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,067
when she found out it was not you.

207
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:06,614
You thought she was getting married,
but all you did was drink.

208
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,408
She has the right to feel angry.

209
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,537
I am the leader of Songrim now.

210
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,746
I can no longer do whatever I want,
so I held back.

211
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:16,706
What would you have done?

212
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:21,378
If I were youâ€¦

213
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:25,548
I would have done it.

214
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:32,139
Because now I know
how much I will regret itâ€¦

215
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,226
if I decide to walk away.

216
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,562
When I found out it was her,

217
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,566
I should have stepped forward
and held onto her

218
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,443
instead of stepping away.

219
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:48,447
Dang-go.

220
00:15:50,615 --> 00:15:52,368
The most tragic experience

221
00:15:53,326 --> 00:15:55,913
is to live your entire life
regretting what you could have done.

222
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:59,459
Please do not live that way.

223
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,269
Young Master, you are back.

224
00:16:18,351 --> 00:16:19,351
Yes.

225
00:16:21,813 --> 00:16:22,899
Go on inside.

226
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,826
What a nice place.

227
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,327
It looks larger than Jinyowon.

228
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:39,706
What now?

229
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,204
Are you calculating
how wealthy your husband must be?

230
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,253
Jinyowon is extremely rich too.

231
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:48,883
Marrying a girl from a rich family like me
will help you boost your wealth.

232
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,342
Not interested.

233
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,260
All I need is your great divine powers.

234
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:57,767
What about other qualities?
I might have more to offer.

235
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,143
No.

236
00:17:00,727 --> 00:17:03,313
That is the only reason I need you.

237
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:10,028
But that is the one thing
I do not possess.

238
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,325
Gosh, I should not have said
my powers were that great.

239
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,750
Young Master Jang,
where in the world were you?

240
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:24,835
Oh, heyâ€¦

241
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,048
Who, may I ask, are you?

242
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,217
- I am...
- My bride-to-be.

243
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,135
Pardon? Your bride-to-be?

244
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:35,887
It is so sudden...

245
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:37,765
Maidservant Kim, I will explain later.

246
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:40,977
Our guest is very exhausted right now.

247
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:42,603
Could you prepare a room for her?

248
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,147
Please, Maidservant Kim.

249
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:48,526
Yes, Young Master.

250
00:17:48,608 --> 00:17:50,903
I will find a room for her to rest in.

251
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:00,704
Maidservant Kim raised me
ever since I was a baby.

252
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,584
She is very dear to me,
so please treat her with respect.

253
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:08,211
She is kind at heart,
so she will make you feel at home.

254
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:10,047
You asked a person that dear to you

255
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:12,383
to look after me?

256
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:14,926
- What about it?
- It is justâ€¦

257
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,929
I thought you would give me a hard time

258
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,140
for forcing you to take me with you.

259
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:21,601
I did not expect you to be so hospitable.

260
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,103
Who says I was forced?

261
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,106
I know I was not the most welcoming,

262
00:18:29,107 --> 00:18:30,859
but I went there because I needed you.

263
00:18:31,943 --> 00:18:33,112
You are my betrothed now,

264
00:18:33,903 --> 00:18:35,383
so you should be treated accordingly.

265
00:18:35,905 --> 00:18:39,743
But people will be suspicious
about you bringing me here.

266
00:18:40,368 --> 00:18:41,578
Should we not be careful?

267
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:42,662
I thought

268
00:18:43,204 --> 00:18:45,665
you came with me because you were fed up
with being locked up.

269
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,319
There is nothing to be careful of.

270
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:50,086
Just do as you wish.

271
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:51,796
No one here

272
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,383
will stop you from doing what you want.

273
00:18:56,801 --> 00:18:58,054
Thank you for saying that.

274
00:18:58,136 --> 00:19:00,056
I will try my best to feel at home.

275
00:19:03,224 --> 00:19:06,311
I will accept your hospitality.

276
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:11,067
You will find this room
the most comfortable.

277
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:14,569
I will quickly bring you some food.

278
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:27,208
I hope it suits your palate.

279
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:29,460
Let me know if you need anything.

280
00:19:30,126 --> 00:19:31,126
I will.

281
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:42,097
When you are done bathing,
I will have clean clothes ready for you.

282
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:47,060
I did not have time
to get you anything new,

283
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:50,271
so I brought you clothes that
used to belong to Madam Do-hwa.

284
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,523
It looks nice on you.

285
00:19:52,023 --> 00:19:54,383
It is not only pretty,
but it is also light and comfortable.

286
00:19:54,984 --> 00:19:55,819
By any chance,

287
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,114
is it all right if I keep this?

288
00:20:00,907 --> 00:20:03,368
It is neither in trend nor is it new.

289
00:20:03,451 --> 00:20:05,621
But if you like it, go ahead.

290
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:07,998
- Thank you.
- You are welcome.

291
00:20:14,462 --> 00:20:15,462
You seeâ€¦

292
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:21,053
I am acquainted with a lot of people.

293
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:26,433
So I know every young lady
that lives in the capital.

294
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:28,309
But I have never seen you before.

295
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,645
I have never left my house.

296
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:31,814
That is probably why.

297
00:20:31,896 --> 00:20:33,022
I see.

298
00:20:33,648 --> 00:20:36,067
Your parents must be very strict.

299
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,368
Where are the young master's parents?

300
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:46,662
Do they not live here?

301
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,414
They both passed away.

302
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:51,499
Did you not know?

303
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,130
We only just met.

304
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:58,173
By any chance,

305
00:20:58,923 --> 00:21:03,095
do you also not know
what happened to him three years ago?

306
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,558
So you know nothing about him,

307
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:11,311
yet you followed him here
just because he asked you to marry him?

308
00:21:11,936 --> 00:21:13,396
I was the one who asked.

309
00:21:14,355 --> 00:21:15,732
I asked him to marry me.

310
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:17,734
It was me who asked.

311
00:21:17,817 --> 00:21:19,653
And he said yes to that?

312
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,070
Yes.

313
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:24,950
How strange.

314
00:21:26,117 --> 00:21:27,117
I never thought

315
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:30,038
he would even consider
getting married again.

316
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:32,958
This is hard to believe.

317
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,211
I wonder what he is thinking.

318
00:21:48,848 --> 00:21:52,185
<i><font color="white">Jin Bu-yeon had divine powers
that were as powerful as Jin Seol-ran's.</font></i>

319
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,646
<i><font color="white">Do you wish to remove the ice stone?</font></i>

320
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:57,441
<i><font color="white">If you do that, you will die.</font></i>

321
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:09,912
Are you all right?

322
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,873
What happened?
Why are you soaked in water?

323
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:26,594
Look.

324
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:31,683
Excuse me.

325
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:33,852
Are you all right?

326
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:34,935
Are you awake?

327
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:38,690
Where am I?

328
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:40,733
How did I end up here?

329
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,740
<i><font color="white">I must find the ice stone.</font></i>

330
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:57,041
I was told I would find him in his study.

331
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:11,682
What are you doing?

332
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:13,767
Are you stealing that?

333
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,020
I am sorry.

334
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:21,692
I am just so used
to stealing food and drinks.

335
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:24,653
Leave it here.

336
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:40,294
What?

337
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:43,348
You said it was all right
to do as I wished.

338
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,177
I always stole alcohol and drank alone.

339
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:52,013
Have a drink with me
to celebrate my escape.

340
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:25,755
If you drink that,

341
00:24:27,715 --> 00:24:29,343
it means we are officially married.

342
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,762
Let us think of it as a wedding drink.

343
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,267
Go on. Drink up.

344
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:41,980
A wedding drink?

345
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:58,913
Drink up.

346
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,378
Why are you not drinking it?

347
00:25:05,461 --> 00:25:07,506
There is no need to rush
our first night together.

348
00:25:07,588 --> 00:25:08,923
Take it slow. The night is young.

349
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,069
Summer nights are shorter.
The sun will shine any time now.

350
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:13,693
What does that have anything to do
with becoming a married couple?

351
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:16,472
I prefer it when it is dark.

352
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,644
It would be awkward to do it in daylight.

353
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:25,398
You really have a way
of surprising me with your words.

354
00:25:27,233 --> 00:25:29,111
Drinking during the day is bad for you.

355
00:25:29,193 --> 00:25:31,779
I only drank stolen alcohol at night,
so go on.

356
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,490
Drink up.

357
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:38,786
Fine.

358
00:25:39,203 --> 00:25:40,883
I will drink as soon as I check something.

359
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,493
This is our first night together.

360
00:25:51,924 --> 00:25:53,324
You said it makes you feel awkward.

361
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:04,896
Here.

362
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:07,482
You can turn off the last lantern.

363
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,026
For your information,

364
00:26:09,108 --> 00:26:12,653
I received this as a gift from Jinyowon
for complicated reasons.

365
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:14,906
They said it was some kind of a lantern

366
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,115
that never turns off.

367
00:26:17,241 --> 00:26:19,912
Anyway, the light cannot be blown out.

368
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:22,663
Since you are
a great priestess of Jinyowon,

369
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:25,459
use your divine powers to turn it off.

370
00:26:27,001 --> 00:26:28,002
I am waiting.

371
00:27:00,451 --> 00:27:01,451
You cannot do it.

372
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,708
Why can you not do it?
I thought you had great divine powers.

373
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:08,734
Apparently, I lost my divine powers

374
00:27:10,586 --> 00:27:12,506
along with my memory.

375
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,469
All I can do is see energy with my eyes.

376
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:23,141
Nothing else.

377
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:25,227
Then you are of no use to me.

378
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,152
Go home at daybreak.

379
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:35,570
Tell them you got lost.

380
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:37,154
You said you escaped a few times.

381
00:27:39,365 --> 00:27:40,741
Do you know why I got caught

382
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,369
every time I ran away?

383
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:55,757
Because of this.

384
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,800
They always used this to find me.

385
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:06,643
<i><font color="white">The tracking thread found
the bride's boat.</font></i>

386
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:19,239
Follow the energy of the tracking thread,

387
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,157
and we will find her.

388
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:25,621
The thread is tightening around my wrist.

389
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:27,705
That means they will be here soon.

390
00:28:32,501 --> 00:28:34,046
So this is how they find you.

391
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:36,964
People from Jinyowon will come,

392
00:28:37,798 --> 00:28:39,926
and they will know it was you who took me.

393
00:28:40,509 --> 00:28:41,509
When they comeâ€¦

394
00:28:43,387 --> 00:28:45,848
I will tell them that
we got married overnight.

395
00:28:47,433 --> 00:28:48,433
This means

396
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:51,230
I cannot send you back quietly.

397
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:53,105
This thread comes from Jinyowon,

398
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,651
and no sword is strong enough to cut it.

399
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,069
Jang Uk.

400
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:01,906
I do not wish to go back.

401
00:29:03,951 --> 00:29:04,992
I like it here.

402
00:29:09,288 --> 00:29:10,288
And I like you too.

403
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:53,712
I cannot feel the energy
of the tracking thread.

404
00:29:54,875 --> 00:29:56,002
The thread has been cut.

405
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:02,674
There.

406
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:04,468
I cut the thread.

407
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,805
Now you can quietly return home.

408
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:13,644
Leave once the sun rises.

409
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,240
I will leave now.

410
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:27,684
It will be more embarrassing
to be caught in broad daylight.

411
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:32,122
I may have deceived you,

412
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,415
but not everything was a lie.

413
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,626
I do have great divine powers.

414
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:40,431
And the person who treated me told me
that once I get my memory back,

415
00:30:41,964 --> 00:30:43,884
my divine powers will come back as well.

416
00:30:47,261 --> 00:30:48,471
I am sorry I lied to you.

417
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:51,599
Thank you for your hospitality.

418
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:53,601
When I get back,

419
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:56,730
I will not mention your name.

420
00:30:58,565 --> 00:30:59,775
<i><font color="white">Bu-yeon has disappeared.</font></i>

421
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,692
Do you think

422
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:04,820
she has regained her memories and powers?

423
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:08,909
If she regained her memories,
she may have run away.

424
00:31:09,992 --> 00:31:11,536
After all, the soul inside that body

425
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,163
belongs to Naksu.

426
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:15,539
The body is Bu-yeon's.

427
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:18,311
The blood of the eldest daughter
of the Jin family runs in that body.

428
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:21,087
Is that the reason you confined her

429
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:23,331
and tried to marry her off
to carry on the family line?

430
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:27,426
What were you planning to do with her body
once she gave birth to a baby?

431
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:29,179
Get rid of it once again?

432
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:31,681
Did you forget what you promised me

433
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:34,476
when you begged me to save her life
after you found her body

434
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:38,063
at the bottom of Lake Gyeongcheondaeho?

435
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:49,950
The body has petrified
without a single ounce of water left,

436
00:31:50,032 --> 00:31:51,592
yet she is still alive. How miraculous.

437
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,369
3 YEARS AGO

438
00:31:53,452 --> 00:31:54,538
Please save her.

439
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:57,624
She is my long-lost daughter.

440
00:31:57,707 --> 00:32:01,169
I always wondered why she never ran wild
even with Naksu's energy.

441
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:04,423
I guess it was because the body
belonged to a Jinyowon priestess.

442
00:32:06,173 --> 00:32:09,385
Naksu did not take over this body
using the alchemy of souls.

443
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:12,638
Her soul was actually locked up
inside this body.

444
00:32:12,721 --> 00:32:15,683
She called me "Mother."

445
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:16,934
Bu-yeon's soul

446
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:20,689
also remains inside this body.

447
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:25,986
The choice is yours.

448
00:32:27,778 --> 00:32:29,218
The only way to keep this body alive

449
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:32,784
is to use Naksu's energy
that remains inside the body.

450
00:32:33,367 --> 00:32:35,871
Bu-yeon's soul is clinging to that energy.

451
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:39,540
In order to use Naksu's energy,
we must get rid of Bu-yeon's soul

452
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,292
while leaving Naksu's.

453
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:44,296
Are you asking me

454
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:49,009
to choose Naksu's soul
over my own daughter's?

455
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,761
That or let them both die.

456
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:54,888
What will you do?

457
00:32:55,973 --> 00:32:58,602
Do you wish to keep the body alive
through Naksu's soul?

458
00:32:58,684 --> 00:33:01,270
Or will you keep your daughter's soul
and watch her die?

459
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,400
I will respect your decision.

460
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,920
<i><font color="white">She is recovering using Naksu's energy.</font></i>

461
00:34:07,002 --> 00:34:10,047
<i><font color="white">As the energy flows in her face
and she starts looking human again,</font></i>

462
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:12,130
her features will
slowly resemble those of Naksu's.

463
00:34:13,592 --> 00:34:16,012
The body and soul must be one
for her not to run wild.

464
00:34:16,887 --> 00:34:19,727
Are you telling me to look at that face
and think of her as my daughter?

465
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:22,893
You made your own choice.

466
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:27,356
You decided to use all of Naksu's energy
to save your daughter's body.

467
00:34:29,858 --> 00:34:33,195
She has a new body now,
so her memory is gone.

468
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,032
Naksu's soul may still remain,

469
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:38,326
but she lost both her energy

470
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:40,869
and memory.

471
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:07,355
She remembers nothing,
which is why she thinks you are her mother

472
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:10,065
and does not struggle to accept
that she is Jin Bu-yeon.

473
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,128
She opens the doors to Jinyowon
and sees the energy of the world

474
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:14,872
because my daughter's blood
runs inside her.

475
00:35:14,945 --> 00:35:17,032
But she has no other powers.

476
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:19,367
My daughter

477
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:23,829
used to handle relics inside Jinyowon
as if they were her toys.

478
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:27,458
Does this mean she lost her divine powers?

479
00:35:27,541 --> 00:35:29,543
Bu-yeon's body has no divine powers,

480
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:31,545
and Naksu's soul has no memory,

481
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,922
so the body and soul do not conflict.

482
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:36,259
If she regains her divine powers,

483
00:35:36,842 --> 00:35:39,054
Naksu's memory will likely follow.

484
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:41,347
Can you bear that?

485
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:44,726
I would rather have her stay that way

486
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:47,853
than have Naksu's memory come back.

487
00:35:47,936 --> 00:35:49,981
Then are you going to keep her confined?

488
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,443
That is my decision to make.

489
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:57,155
And if I decide to kill her
because I can no longer stand it,

490
00:35:57,237 --> 00:35:58,237
then so be it.

491
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:01,701
You promised to respect my decisions.

492
00:36:03,702 --> 00:36:05,329
Jang Uk loved her.

493
00:36:06,121 --> 00:36:09,166
If you tell him,
he will help you protect her.

494
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,461
No. He was in love with Naksu.

495
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,677
She will only live
as my daughter, Bu-yeon.

496
00:36:20,177 --> 00:36:23,389
I will not let him find out about her.

497
00:36:25,182 --> 00:36:30,646
Besides, Jang Uk does not know
what Naksu's real face even looks like.

498
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:35,527
<i><font color="white">Even if the two ever do meet,</font></i>

499
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:40,614
<i><font color="white">they will not be able
to recognize each other.</font></i>

500
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:48,456
<i><font color="white">I have to live my life in agony
looking at that girl's face,</font></i>

501
00:36:49,206 --> 00:36:52,293
<i><font color="white">so that is the price that must be paid.</font></i>

502
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:59,092
I respected your decision as a mother

503
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:02,010
and did not tell anyone
about her existence.

504
00:37:02,594 --> 00:37:04,097
However, todayâ€¦

505
00:37:05,889 --> 00:37:08,476
the entire world ended up
finding out about Bu-yeon.

506
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:12,896
What is important is that I find her.

507
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:16,900
She has escaped a few times before,
but I always managed to find her.

508
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:19,570
This timeâ€¦

509
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:22,907
it will be no different.

510
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:36,963
Goodbye, my lady.

511
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:01,945
What is that smell?

512
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:05,157
Is it the smell of water?

513
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:14,041
What is that?

514
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,211
I sense a strange kind of energy.

515
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:22,175
Are you on patrol?

516
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:24,050
Did something happen?

517
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,949
Mister. Wake up.

518
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,601
I am sure it came in here.

519
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:44,965
Hey, wake up. Are you all right?

520
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:49,469
<i><font color="white">It is not inside him.</font></i>

521
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,891
<i><font color="white">Where did that energy go?</font></i>

522
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:16,706
I know you are hiding in there.

523
00:40:17,831 --> 00:40:19,125
Why did you come here?

524
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:33,264
This may be broken,

525
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:35,307
but it is a Jinyowon relic
that still holds power.

526
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:37,059
Eat this and go away.

527
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:41,706
Young Master.

528
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:44,418
Did something strange
enter the house again?

529
00:41:44,501 --> 00:41:46,003
Should I wake Maidservant Kim?

530
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:47,422
I already took care of it.

531
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,423
Just let her sleep.

532
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:54,450
You will get cold tonight
because you came in contact with it.

533
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,556
Drink some strong liquor
before going to bed.

534
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:57,681
Yes, Young Master.

535
00:41:58,391 --> 00:42:01,978
She came to check up on me
and tried to help me.

536
00:42:03,061 --> 00:42:04,521
She will also be feeling cold.

537
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:06,690
I will bring a brazier
and some strong liquor.

538
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:11,088
<i><font color="white">If you drink that,</font></i>

539
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,257
<i><font color="white">it means we are officially married.</font></i>

540
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,885
<i><font color="white">Let us think of it as a wedding drink.</font></i>

541
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:32,943
She is of no use to me,
and yet she is a nuisance.

542
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,030
Here is the portrait I received
before the wedding.

543
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:39,992
Can you really find her?

544
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:41,720
With the help
of Songrim's merchants' association,

545
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:45,123
every person in Daeho
will get to see this portrait by today.

546
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:50,085
I will help Young Lady Jin
find her sister.

547
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:54,590
WHOEVER FINDS THIS LADY
WILL BE REWARDED GENEROUSLY

548
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:58,927
She is Jin Bu-yeon,
the eldest daughter of Jinyowon.

549
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,527
All the ladies at Jinyowon are beautiful.

550
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:04,057
Is it true that
whoever finds her will be rewarded?

551
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:05,684
Yes, it says it right there.

552
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:07,936
Goodness, they are giving a reward.

553
00:44:10,273 --> 00:44:12,150
Does that mean Jin Bu-yeon is going to be

554
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:13,985
the next leader of Jinyowon?

555
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:15,110
Most likely.

556
00:44:15,695 --> 00:44:19,072
Ever since she was young,
she was known for her great divine powers.

557
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:21,032
Lady Jin's divine powers have weakened,

558
00:44:21,117 --> 00:44:23,010
so many have been saying
the Jin family should no longer be

559
00:44:23,034 --> 00:44:24,554
in charge of the relics and artifacts.

560
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:28,373
So this is good news for the Jin family.

561
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:30,668
<i><font color="white">Are you saying the Seo family</font></i>

562
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,335
and the Jin family were
planning to become in-laws?

563
00:44:33,753 --> 00:44:34,753
Yes, Your Majesty.

564
00:44:35,338 --> 00:44:37,090
Yun-o, we are cousins.

565
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:39,467
How could you not tell me
about the wedding?

566
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:43,097
I cannot believe even my own family
would disrespect me like this

567
00:44:44,806 --> 00:44:46,057
because of how I look.

568
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:47,643
No one in the family knows.

569
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:50,103
Lady Jin insisted
the wedding be held in secret.

570
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:51,521
Please do not be angry.

571
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:54,275
Then I guess Lady Jin
also has no respect for me.

572
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:57,612
Her dead husband is the reason
why I look like this.

573
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:00,739
Wait a minute.

574
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,367
You were going to marry into the family

575
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:06,286
that did this to me?

576
00:45:07,829 --> 00:45:08,664
Forgive me.

577
00:45:08,748 --> 00:45:10,833
The marriage has been canceled.
Please calm down.

578
00:45:13,418 --> 00:45:14,418
Not a single person

579
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:17,213
acknowledges the pain I feel.

580
00:45:17,797 --> 00:45:19,175
Could you please

581
00:45:19,257 --> 00:45:21,677
help me find a way
to get out of this body?

582
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,762
There is no other way.

583
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:28,266
I cannot let you shift souls

584
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:30,603
just because you are the Queen.

585
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:35,900
Anyway, now that we know
that Jinyowon's heir is alive and well,

586
00:45:37,275 --> 00:45:40,570
they can appoint her as the official heir
at the Unanimous Assembly.

587
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:50,413
Are you telling me

588
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:54,335
that this is the face of Jin Bu-yeon?

589
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:55,418
Yes.

590
00:45:55,795 --> 00:45:58,713
Even Songrim is helping them find her,
so it must be true.

591
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:10,226
<i><font color="white">This is Naksu's face.</font></i>

592
00:46:11,309 --> 00:46:14,230
<i><font color="white">I do not know about anyone else,
but her face is one I cannot forget.</font></i>

593
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:15,313
<i><font color="white">Soâ€¦</font></i>

594
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:18,985
<i><font color="white">how can she be Jin Bu-yeon?</font></i>

595
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:21,277
I should look into it.

596
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:28,244
She is Jin Bu-yeon?

597
00:46:29,619 --> 00:46:30,619
That is not her.

598
00:46:31,414 --> 00:46:32,831
Jin Bu-yeon is Mu-deok.

599
00:46:38,211 --> 00:46:39,963
You must keep your body warm.

600
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:46,137
Mr. Lee told me what happened last night.

601
00:46:46,219 --> 00:46:47,596
Thank goodness you are all right.

602
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:51,684
I am sorry for worrying you.

603
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:54,143
By the way,

604
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:58,065
I heard you were
going to leave last night.

605
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:02,902
Did Young Master Jang not say anything?

606
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:05,155
He stayed by your side all night.

607
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,865
Then he told me

608
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:09,869
to give you some medicine for the chills
and just left.

609
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:12,829
I am about to go to Sejukwon
to get some medicine for you.

610
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:13,748
Maidservant Kim.

611
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:16,208
How many days' worth did he ask for?

612
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:18,168
He asked for three days' worth.

613
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:20,170
Three days' worth?

614
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:27,469
Then I guess I will be staying here
for at least three days.

615
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:35,518
I bet you were

616
00:47:36,561 --> 00:47:37,681
awfully startled last night.

617
00:47:38,563 --> 00:47:42,108
Young Master Jang is
always surrounded by wicked thingsâ€¦

618
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:46,237
which is why he is never able
to sleep properly.

619
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:47,822
Why does that happen to him?

620
00:47:49,282 --> 00:47:52,536
It is because of
the great power within him.

621
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:56,664
They are drawn to it
like moths to a flame.

622
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:02,420
<i><font color="white">Did he need my divine powers
to get rid of that?</font></i>

623
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:06,050
<i><font color="white">He asked if I could
take out the ice stone.</font></i>

624
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:08,677
<i><font color="white">Will he find peace</font></i>

625
00:48:09,594 --> 00:48:10,721
<i><font color="white">if that gets taken out?</font></i>

626
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,009
My lord.

627
00:48:51,052 --> 00:48:52,554
What are you doing today?

628
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:55,224
They are red beans.

629
00:48:55,306 --> 00:48:56,626
Are you making red bean porridge?

630
00:48:57,684 --> 00:49:01,188
I am going to make <i><font color="white">meju</font></i> with red beans.

631
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:04,733
You are going to make <i><font color="white">meju</font></i>
with red beans, not soybeans?

632
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:07,235
"Making <i><font color="white">meju</font></i> with red beans"
is an expression

633
00:49:07,318 --> 00:49:09,822
that people use
to describe a lie or bluff.

634
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:12,157
But if I actually make <i><font color="white">meju</font></i>
with red beans,

635
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:16,202
then that expression will no longer exist.

636
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:20,248
Everyone thinks this is impossible,
and I will be the first

637
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:22,918
to prove them wrong.

638
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:28,548
I am going to challenge myself.

639
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:29,632
I bet you will lose.

640
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:31,385
<i><font color="white">Meju</font></i> is made with soybeans.

641
00:49:31,467 --> 00:49:33,179
- Red beans might work.
- Soybeans.

642
00:49:33,262 --> 00:49:34,179
- Red beans.
- Soy.

643
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:35,139
- Red.
- Soy.

644
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:36,514
- Soybeans.
- Red beans.

645
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:37,766
- Red beans.
- Soybeans.

646
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:38,934
- Red.
- Soy.

647
00:49:39,018 --> 00:49:40,018
- Red beans.
- Redâ€¦

648
00:49:40,059 --> 00:49:41,311
-Soyâ€¦
-Soy, redâ€¦

649
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:50,153
You and I really do click well.

650
00:49:50,905 --> 00:49:51,905
Goodness.

651
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:56,492
Even if you do make <i><font color="white">meju</font></i> with red beans,
I will not even be that shocked.

652
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:59,829
Something even more shocking
happened last night.

653
00:49:59,914 --> 00:50:00,998
What?

654
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:03,083
Young Master Jang

655
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:05,628
suddenly brought a lady home,
saying he will marry her.

656
00:50:06,836 --> 00:50:09,547
Uk wants to marry someone?

657
00:50:09,632 --> 00:50:12,300
This is more shocking
than what you are about to do, right?

658
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:16,222
Uk is still not over that girl, right?

659
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:17,306
Of course not.

660
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:18,389
She is stillâ€¦

661
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:22,268
in his heart.

662
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:25,938
My lord.

663
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:29,150
I really do hope you succeed

664
00:50:29,235 --> 00:50:30,945
in making <i><font color="white">meju</font></i> with red beans.

665
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:34,657
Show me that impossible things
sometimes do happen.

666
00:50:36,115 --> 00:50:39,369
Uk brought someone home
saying he will marry her?

667
00:50:46,751 --> 00:50:48,128
Three days of taking medicine.

668
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:50,547
A man and a woman
living together for three days?

669
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:52,862
That is pretty much a married couple.

670
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,094
There is still hope.

671
00:51:01,724 --> 00:51:02,768
Who are you?

672
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:05,228
I am Young Master Jang's physician.

673
00:51:05,311 --> 00:51:07,991
I came because I heard Maidservant Kim
dropped by for some medicine.

674
00:51:09,108 --> 00:51:11,110
I guess he sent you to take care of me,

675
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:13,027
although it was not necessary.

676
00:51:14,655 --> 00:51:16,949
Who exactly are you?

677
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:18,117
Young Lady Heo.

678
00:51:18,199 --> 00:51:21,202
She looks exactly like the lady
that Lord Dang-go

679
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:22,996
and Young Master Seo Yul are looking for.

680
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:25,791
You are right.

681
00:51:25,873 --> 00:51:28,460
Is your name Jin Bu-yeon?

682
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:29,795
How do you know my name?

683
00:51:30,461 --> 00:51:32,172
No one knows who I am.

684
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:33,590
What are you talking about?

685
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:36,050
Your face is all over the capital.

686
00:51:36,135 --> 00:51:37,510
Everyone is looking for you.

687
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:39,238
What are you doing
at Young Master Jang's place?

688
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:41,514
- You should get out of here.
- Sun-i.

689
00:51:43,182 --> 00:51:46,353
<i><font color="white">Everyone knows about me,
and people are looking for me?</font></i>

690
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:48,731
<i><font color="white">Mother would never do that.</font></i>

691
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:51,317
<i><font color="white">Then who is looking for me?</font></i>

692
00:51:52,608 --> 00:51:54,652
Are those your clothes?

693
00:51:54,737 --> 00:51:56,112
Is that not a wedding dress?

694
00:51:56,195 --> 00:51:58,364
Did you say a man named Seo Yul
is looking for me?

695
00:51:58,449 --> 00:51:59,449
Pardon?

696
00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:00,492
Yes.

697
00:52:00,576 --> 00:52:02,220
A man from the Seo family
at Seoho Fortress?

698
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:04,454
The man who lacks nothing? Is that him?

699
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:05,538
Yes, pretty much.

700
00:52:16,425 --> 00:52:18,385
Why do you think Jin Bu-yeon was here?

701
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:20,302
I do not know.

702
00:52:22,181 --> 00:52:24,349
Where are you going this time?

703
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:25,601
I am leaving.

704
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:27,686
Tell Uk that I do not need the medicine.

705
00:52:28,394 --> 00:52:29,394
Pardon?

706
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:39,140
<i><font color="white">Seo Yul really is looking for me.</font></i>

707
00:52:40,114 --> 00:52:42,594
<i><font color="white">He is looking for me
even though I ran away on our wedding day?</font></i>

708
00:52:43,494 --> 00:52:45,704
<i><font color="white">I am guessing he went against my mother</font></i>

709
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:48,289
<i><font color="white">seeing that he revealed
my face to the world.</font></i>

710
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:52,001
It will not be a bad idea
to bet my life on him.

711
00:52:55,713 --> 00:52:57,840
I had no idea you were from Jinyowon.

712
00:52:59,425 --> 00:53:02,262
I apologize for not recognizing you
and calling you a thief.

713
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:05,681
Everyone is looking for you.
Shall I escort you back to Jinyowon?

714
00:53:05,766 --> 00:53:08,309
First, I would like to meet Seo Yul.

715
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:11,063
Is he here?

716
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:13,898
Young Master Seo isâ€¦

717
00:53:13,981 --> 00:53:15,567
Let me see if he is in his room.

718
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:16,650
Please wait.

719
00:53:19,195 --> 00:53:20,572
Let me meet him first.

720
00:53:21,739 --> 00:53:24,367
If he turns out to be all right,
I will choose him.

721
00:54:17,253 --> 00:54:18,380
Does that count

722
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:21,175
as a wedding drink?

723
00:54:32,101 --> 00:54:36,440
<i><font color="white">You should never date a man with a past
as painful as a stab to the heart.</font></i>

724
00:54:41,277 --> 00:54:43,155
A past as painful as a stab to the heart?

725
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:45,324
He must be in a lot of pain.

726
00:54:50,913 --> 00:54:51,746
Young Lady.

727
00:54:51,829 --> 00:54:52,829
Young Lady.

728
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:55,541
Young Master Seo is coming right this way.

729
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,275
Everyone is looking for you,

730
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:25,155
but I never thought
you would come looking for me.

731
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:28,492
I apologize for running away
on the day of the wedding.

732
00:55:28,574 --> 00:55:31,786
Now that I have met you,
I regret having done that.

733
00:55:31,869 --> 00:55:33,829
If I had met you first,

734
00:55:33,914 --> 00:55:37,376
I would not have hesitated
about getting married.

735
00:55:39,168 --> 00:55:40,878
Why would I have affected your decision?

736
00:55:40,963 --> 00:55:42,547
Because you are handsome.

737
00:55:43,965 --> 00:55:47,427
It is only natural to waver
when one meets a handsome man.

738
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:52,431
But that is as far as I can go.

739
00:55:52,516 --> 00:55:56,103
Last night, I already gave my heart
to someone else.

740
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:59,648
I thought I packed all my clothes
and brought everything with me,

741
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:04,110
but last night's memory still lingers
and will not allow me to move on.

742
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:10,992
Are you saying you no longer wish to marry

743
00:56:12,411 --> 00:56:13,661
a member of the Seo family?

744
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:15,621
Yes.

745
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:19,710
So I would appreciate it
if you would stop the public search.

746
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:23,420
All right.

747
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:26,592
I will relay the message to my uncle.

748
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:32,722
I was not your betrothed.

749
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:34,575
A man with the surname Seo
from Seoho Fortress.

750
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:36,893
- You came on a boat.
- I came with my uncle.

751
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:40,122
I guess you misunderstood
because you did not know his name.

752
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:41,188
So it was not you?

753
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:45,485
Thank goodness.

754
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:47,903
Now it is a lot easier
to give up the marriage.

755
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:50,949
To be honest,
I was worried that I might regret it.

756
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:52,699
But now I feel fine.

757
00:57:04,295 --> 00:57:05,295
What is the matter?

758
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:11,260
Have we ever met before?

759
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:15,514
That is impossible.

760
00:57:16,016 --> 00:57:17,476
I never went outside.

761
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:24,455
I need to go. I have three days' worth
of medicine waiting for me.

762
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:29,112
Please let your uncle know.

763
00:57:37,913 --> 00:57:39,331
It is time to go back, my lady.

764
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:41,791
Could you just give me a bit more time?

765
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:42,875
Just three days.

766
00:57:43,376 --> 00:57:46,380
Then I will willingly enter that room

767
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,173
and stay there, just as Mother wants.

768
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:50,925
Just give me three days.

769
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:53,177
I am here on Lady Jin's orders.

770
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:54,887
Come with us.

771
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:08,402
Was she confined?

772
00:58:13,572 --> 00:58:14,657
Young Master.

773
00:58:15,282 --> 00:58:17,411
Was that lady from Jinyowon?

774
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:22,248
The entire capital is looking for her.

775
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,710
Maybe that is why, but she suddenly left.

776
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:27,878
- She left?
- Yes.

777
00:58:27,963 --> 00:58:30,257
She took her wedding dress and everything.

778
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:32,009
What happened?

779
00:58:32,092 --> 00:58:34,594
What matters is that she is gone.
Forget about yesterday.

780
00:58:40,349 --> 00:58:41,349
I knew it.

781
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:44,021
Some things are just impossible.

782
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:12,132
Now that it is broken,

783
00:59:13,215 --> 00:59:14,885
you can go anywhere you want, right?

784
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:17,971
If you wish to run, I can help.

785
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:20,181
If you want, I can give you some money.

786
00:59:20,264 --> 00:59:21,891
You promised not to say my name,

787
00:59:21,974 --> 00:59:24,351
so think of it as a settlement.

788
00:59:25,936 --> 00:59:26,938
My motherâ€¦

789
00:59:28,981 --> 00:59:30,483
lost me when I was little

790
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,777
and looked for me for over ten years.

791
00:59:33,527 --> 00:59:36,072
I do wish to come out
because it gets suffocating inside,

792
00:59:36,155 --> 00:59:38,115
but I cannot just plainly disappear.

793
00:59:39,492 --> 00:59:40,492
If I do that,

794
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:44,081
she will lose her daughter again.

795
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:48,960
And that will kill her inside.

796
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:55,884
I cannot do that to her.

797
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:01,097
I guess she went back

798
01:00:02,807 --> 01:00:03,809
and got locked up again.

799
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:37,217
My precious daughter.

800
01:00:38,385 --> 01:00:39,760
I thought I lost you again.

801
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:42,556
I am sorry, Mother.

802
01:00:44,391 --> 01:00:45,391
My sweetheart.

803
01:00:46,518 --> 01:00:47,561
Bu-yeon.

804
01:00:49,103 --> 01:00:50,103
My daughter.

805
01:00:55,443 --> 01:00:56,777
You broke off the engagement?

806
01:00:58,405 --> 01:00:59,822
The Queen is not happy with it.

807
01:01:01,115 --> 01:01:02,826
I did not think that far ahead.

808
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:04,494
Then what will happen to her?

809
01:01:05,619 --> 01:01:06,454
Why should I care?

810
01:01:06,538 --> 01:01:09,331
They kept her hidden
because they were embarrassed by her.

811
01:01:09,416 --> 01:01:11,251
I did them a favor
by offering to marry her.

812
01:01:12,793 --> 01:01:14,420
But they ruined everything.

813
01:01:22,012 --> 01:01:23,012
Is it happening again?

814
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:25,764
You came to Daeho
because the pain worsened.

815
01:01:25,849 --> 01:01:27,559
Did you ask Master Heo to treat you?

816
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:35,775
Please do not tell anyone
about my condition.

817
01:01:49,581 --> 01:01:50,998
His Majesty has ordered you

818
01:01:51,081 --> 01:01:53,668
to bring Jin Bu-yeon
to the Unanimous Assembly.

819
01:01:56,420 --> 01:01:58,757
Since when did the royal family
give orders to mages

820
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,342
regarding the Unanimous Assembly?

821
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:04,596
Did you advise them to do that
as the Gwanju of Cheonbugwan?

822
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:07,891
Just let me meet her.

823
01:02:09,351 --> 01:02:12,478
I saw a portrait of her,
but I would like to meet her in person.

824
01:02:13,355 --> 01:02:14,355
Why do youâ€¦

825
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:17,192
want to see her?

826
01:02:18,777 --> 01:02:21,028
I am still her uncle.

827
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:25,532
It is only natural
that I want to meet my long-lost niece.

828
01:02:25,617 --> 01:02:26,826
She is a beautiful girl.

829
01:02:29,329 --> 01:02:30,789
Master Lee tells me

830
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:34,416
that she takes after me.

831
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:38,128
Master Lee? The pupil of Seo Gyeong?

832
01:02:38,213 --> 01:02:39,047
Yes.

833
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:42,092
When we found Bu-yeon,
she was extremely ill.

834
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:44,969
Master Lee treated her

835
01:02:45,844 --> 01:02:46,844
and looked after her.

836
01:02:50,307 --> 01:02:51,601
Thanks to you,

837
01:02:52,351 --> 01:02:54,896
I once humiliated myself
by welcoming a fake daughter.

838
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:56,690
I received Master Lee's help

839
01:02:57,315 --> 01:02:59,067
to prevent that from happening again.

840
01:03:01,068 --> 01:03:04,489
If he confirmed it for you,
then it must be Bu-yeon without a doubt.

841
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:07,659
But why did you keep her hidden?

842
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:08,742
I told you she was ill.

843
01:03:08,784 --> 01:03:09,994
Is she well now?

844
01:03:12,746 --> 01:03:15,586
The Unanimous Assembly will suggest
that Jinyowon's relics and artifacts

845
01:03:16,376 --> 01:03:18,545
be moved elsewhere.

846
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:21,338
It means the duty to protect Jinyowon
could get passed on

847
01:03:21,422 --> 01:03:23,465
to a different family.

848
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:25,050
That is nonsense.

849
01:03:25,135 --> 01:03:27,855
This is what happens when you keep
your doors closed for three years.

850
01:03:28,429 --> 01:03:29,639
The leader of Jinyowon is old,

851
01:03:29,722 --> 01:03:32,434
which means her power
is weakening day by day.

852
01:03:32,516 --> 01:03:34,327
Meanwhile, she has no heir
with strong divine powers.

853
01:03:34,351 --> 01:03:37,396
Why would anyone think it would be safe
to leave the Jin family in charge

854
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:39,983
of all those dangerous
and valuable relics and artifacts?

855
01:03:40,065 --> 01:03:41,065
Is that the advice

856
01:03:41,775 --> 01:03:45,112
you are giving me
as the Gwanju of Cheonbugwan?

857
01:03:48,407 --> 01:03:50,577
Here is my advice to you as your brother.

858
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:53,871
Bring Bu-yeon to the Unanimous Assembly.

859
01:03:53,954 --> 01:03:57,125
She is known to have divine powers
as powerful as Jin Seol-ran's.

860
01:03:58,376 --> 01:04:00,336
If you announce her as your official heir,

861
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:04,298
then you will be able to keep Jinyowon.

862
01:04:10,512 --> 01:04:13,807
All right, then.
I will see you at the Unanimous Assembly.

863
01:04:36,331 --> 01:04:38,708
Jin Bu-yeon is going to attend
the Unanimous Assembly

864
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:40,043
held at Cheonbugwan.

865
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:44,297
Jin Bu-yeon has been
the talk of the town for a while now.

866
01:04:44,922 --> 01:04:46,274
I guess she is finally showing up.

867
01:04:46,298 --> 01:04:47,759
Would you like to attend?

868
01:04:47,842 --> 01:04:48,842
No.

869
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:51,012
I do not have fond memories of her.

870
01:04:51,096 --> 01:04:53,698
The last time I went to see her,
I ended up trapped inside a barrier.

871
01:04:53,722 --> 01:04:54,641
You are right.

872
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:55,724
Goodness.

873
01:04:56,809 --> 01:04:58,311
It was so foggy that I could not see.

874
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:00,188
- Right.
- It rained too.

875
01:05:00,938 --> 01:05:01,938
Gosh.

876
01:05:09,905 --> 01:05:11,865
I tried to make <i><font color="white">meju</font></i> with red beans,

877
01:05:11,949 --> 01:05:13,242
but I failed.

878
01:05:14,077 --> 01:05:15,869
So I used it to make red bean porridge.

879
01:05:16,663 --> 01:05:17,831
How does it taste?

880
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:21,126
You say you failed,
but it somehow tastes like <i><font color="white">meju</font></i>.

881
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:22,668
It does, right?

882
01:05:22,751 --> 01:05:25,380
I really think
I might be able to turn it into <i><font color="white">meju</font></i>.

883
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:27,965
Did you invite me to eat
what you failed to make?

884
01:05:28,048 --> 01:05:29,048
Uk.

885
01:05:30,802 --> 01:05:33,179
I heard you brought home
someone you wished to marry.

886
01:05:34,722 --> 01:05:36,682
I figured Maidservant Kim would tell you.

887
01:05:37,851 --> 01:05:40,769
Why did you kidnap
the priestess of Jinyowon

888
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:43,981
on the day of her wedding?

889
01:05:47,943 --> 01:05:48,777
She was pretty.

890
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:51,072
I was mesmerized by her beauty.

891
01:05:51,155 --> 01:05:52,782
Were you going to ask

892
01:05:52,865 --> 01:05:55,827
that beautiful woman
to take out the ice stone for you?

893
01:05:58,246 --> 01:05:59,079
You punk.

894
01:05:59,164 --> 01:06:02,708
You should marry someone
you wish to spend your life with,

895
01:06:02,791 --> 01:06:05,170
not someone who will take your life away.

896
01:06:05,253 --> 01:06:07,255
Do not worry. She ran away.

897
01:06:07,338 --> 01:06:08,338
Good.

898
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:14,262
I heard she is going to be announced
as the official heir of Jinyowon tonight.

899
01:06:16,097 --> 01:06:17,599
Jin Bu-yeon? How?

900
01:06:17,681 --> 01:06:20,143
She is a priestess
with great divine powers.

901
01:06:20,226 --> 01:06:22,853
It seems like there have been concerns
regarding Jinyowon.

902
01:06:24,898 --> 01:06:27,358
If her eldest daughter attends
the Unanimous Assembly

903
01:06:27,442 --> 01:06:28,860
and gets announced as the heir,

904
01:06:30,195 --> 01:06:32,515
Jinyowon will be able to show
that they still stand strong.

905
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:35,120
So they are trying to make <i><font color="white">meju</font></i>
with red beans.

906
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:40,746
Do you know how you can succeed

907
01:06:41,289 --> 01:06:43,416
in making <i><font color="white">meju</font></i> with red beans?

908
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:48,795
Is there really a way?

909
01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:53,050
First, you hide it.

910
01:06:54,052 --> 01:06:55,802
Then you make sure no one tastes it.

911
01:06:55,887 --> 01:06:58,764
Does it taste that bad?

912
01:06:58,847 --> 01:06:59,847
Yes.

913
01:07:00,891 --> 01:07:01,891
It tastes

914
01:07:02,809 --> 01:07:03,809
absolutely horrible.

915
01:07:08,273 --> 01:07:09,567
I will bring you some honey.

916
01:07:10,485 --> 01:07:12,528
Then it will be sweet red bean porridge.

917
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:27,085
Red beans can never turn into <i><font color="white">meju</font></i>.

918
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:28,168
How foolish of her.

919
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:32,757
She should have run away.

920
01:07:37,469 --> 01:07:39,806
I did not want to take you there,

921
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:43,684
but that is the only way
to protect Jinyowon.

922
01:07:44,686 --> 01:07:45,686
Mother.

923
01:07:46,521 --> 01:07:47,855
I have no power.

924
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:50,190
Will it be all right?

925
01:07:52,527 --> 01:07:53,527
That is why

926
01:07:54,862 --> 01:07:55,862
you must help me.

927
01:07:56,405 --> 01:07:58,824
Bu-yeon, you must never
leave this place again.

928
01:07:59,784 --> 01:08:03,371
You cannot ever see anyone
now that everyone knows you.

929
01:08:05,456 --> 01:08:09,210
We cannot let anyone find out
that the heir of Jinyowon

930
01:08:09,918 --> 01:08:11,628
has no divine powers.

931
01:08:14,007 --> 01:08:15,382
Then I will have to stayâ€¦

932
01:08:17,594 --> 01:08:19,345
in this room forever.

933
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:26,560
Please do it for me.

934
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:34,652
Your tracking thread has snapped off.

935
01:09:00,595 --> 01:09:02,387
Let us tie it so that it can never

936
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:04,389
break off again.

937
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:47,849
Howâ€¦

938
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:50,560
did that turn off?

939
01:09:51,104 --> 01:09:54,314
<i><font color="white">Apparently, I lost my divine powers
along with my memory.</font></i>

940
01:09:56,024 --> 01:09:57,024
She clearly told me

941
01:09:58,610 --> 01:10:00,029
that she could not turn it off.

942
01:10:21,591 --> 01:10:22,885
<i><font color="white">I may have deceived you,</font></i>

943
01:10:24,052 --> 01:10:25,430
<i><font color="white">but not everything was a lie.</font></i>

944
01:10:39,234 --> 01:10:41,779
Is it true that Jin Bu-yeon has
immense divine powers?

945
01:10:41,863 --> 01:10:44,823
She found the ice stone, did she not?

946
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:47,659
If she really does show up today,

947
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:51,372
the Jin family can continue
to be in charge of protecting Jinyowon

948
01:10:52,038 --> 01:10:53,207
without any concerns.

949
01:11:07,846 --> 01:11:10,807
After today's assembly, you will go home

950
01:11:10,891 --> 01:11:12,894
and do as you promised.

951
01:11:12,976 --> 01:11:17,273
You will never step outside
of Jinyowon ever again.

952
01:11:34,791 --> 01:11:36,333
Is that Jin Bu-yeon?

953
01:11:44,591 --> 01:11:46,301
I would like to introduce to you

954
01:11:46,385 --> 01:11:49,180
the heir of Jinyowon.

955
01:12:24,841 --> 01:12:26,132
Hello, everyone.

956
01:12:26,216 --> 01:12:27,926
I am Jin Bu-yeon, the eldest daughter

957
01:12:29,427 --> 01:12:30,470
of the Jin family.

958
01:12:55,246 --> 01:12:57,456
- What happened?
- What is going on?

959
01:12:57,539 --> 01:12:58,539
- What?
- What is it?

960
01:12:58,582 --> 01:13:00,083
- What is this?
- What is happening?

961
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:53,720
Jang Uk?

962
01:13:53,762 --> 01:13:56,140
What is Jang Uk doing
at the Unanimous Assembly?

963
01:14:04,606 --> 01:14:06,274
You left without taking your medicine.

964
01:14:07,025 --> 01:14:08,319
Everyone was looking for me.

965
01:14:08,402 --> 01:14:10,070
Why are you here?

966
01:14:10,154 --> 01:14:11,238
To check something.

967
01:14:15,533 --> 01:14:16,993
This was turned off.

968
01:14:17,078 --> 01:14:18,078
Did you do it?

969
01:14:19,997 --> 01:14:21,707
I turned it on again.

970
01:14:21,791 --> 01:14:23,083
Try turning it off again.

971
01:14:31,175 --> 01:14:32,175
Iâ€¦

972
01:14:34,511 --> 01:14:35,511
do not know how.

973
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:42,185
If you turn this off,

974
01:14:43,229 --> 01:14:44,354
I will take you with me.

975
01:14:53,948 --> 01:14:54,948
Waitâ€¦

976
01:15:06,292 --> 01:15:07,292
It turned off.

977
01:15:10,422 --> 01:15:11,422
Didâ€¦

978
01:15:12,507 --> 01:15:13,509
Did I do that?

979
01:15:40,036 --> 01:15:41,328
What are you doing?

980
01:15:41,412 --> 01:15:42,412
Jin Bu-yeonâ€¦

981
01:15:44,664 --> 01:15:46,375
cannot become the heir of Jinyowon.

982
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:48,752
What do you think you are doing?

983
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:51,880
Jin Bu-yeon

984
01:15:52,672 --> 01:15:54,953
is already married to Jang Uk,
the son of the Jang family.

985
01:15:56,676 --> 01:15:58,511
- They got married?
- Married?

986
01:15:58,595 --> 01:16:00,847
- Jin Bu-yeon and Jang Uk?
- What is he saying?

987
01:16:00,930 --> 01:16:02,891
Bu-yeon, what is this nonsense?

988
01:16:09,398 --> 01:16:10,524
He is right, Mother.

989
01:16:12,693 --> 01:16:15,237
This man and I shared a wedding drink

990
01:16:16,447 --> 01:16:17,655
and became husband and wife.

991
01:16:19,867 --> 01:16:21,577
I will not returnâ€¦

992
01:16:24,204 --> 01:16:25,413
to that room in Jinyowon.

993
01:16:39,470 --> 01:16:40,887
We are married.

994
01:16:42,472 --> 01:16:45,141
Please give us your blessings.

995
01:17:33,774 --> 01:17:36,694
ALCHEMY OF SOULS
PART 2

996
01:17:37,194 --> 01:17:39,070
<i><font color="white">If my powers can be
considered justification,</font></i>

997
01:17:39,154 --> 01:17:41,364
<i><font color="white">I would like to see you
try arguing with that.</font></i>

998
01:17:41,948 --> 01:17:44,409
<i><font color="white">I was hoping for this.</font></i>

999
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:46,912
Why? What is it?

1000
01:17:46,996 --> 01:17:50,039
I need to find out more about Jin Bu-yeon.

1001
01:17:50,957 --> 01:17:53,335
I think we have been circling
the same path.

1002
01:17:53,961 --> 01:17:55,688
There is nothing wrong
with being air headed.

1003
01:17:55,712 --> 01:17:56,712
I was simply flustered.

1004
01:17:57,590 --> 01:17:58,966
That looks delicious.

1005
01:17:59,048 --> 01:18:00,466
Eunuch, do you have some money?

1006
01:18:00,551 --> 01:18:02,802
Me? Were you referring to me?

1007
01:18:02,886 --> 01:18:07,640
<i><font color="white">I shall summon Naksu's soul once again
to distract Jang Uk.</font></i>

1008
01:18:10,769 --> 01:18:15,774
