00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:44,958
ALCHEMY OF SOULS PART 2

2
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:55,887
Throughout my life,

3
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:58,432
I spent most of my time
on this tree alone.

4
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:00,982
So I wonder what it was

5
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:04,691
that made me wait for
someone to come for me.

6
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,731
Because we made a promise.

7
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,357
You may not have remembered me,

8
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,240
but you remembered our
promise to be together,

9
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:14,367
which is why you waited for me.

10
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:38,724
I asked you to carry me last
time, but you just left.

11
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,439
There.

12
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:48,982
Are you happy?

13
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,907
If this is a brief chance
to keep the promise we made,

14
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,239
let us spend time together
like any other couple

15
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:02,536
who have met after pining
and longing for each other.

16
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,304
These chestnuts have
already matured.

17
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,564
- You are right.
- Shall we cook them in rice?

18
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,181
Sure.

19
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:26,685
Do you remember throwing things at
me when I was cooking last time?

20
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,823
- I did?
- "I did"?

21
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,240
You even threw a knife at me.

22
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,404
- Like this?
- Do not do it.

23
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:35,857
I bet I threw it like this.

24
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,464
All right.

25
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:55,797
I will pretend as if
this is nothing more

26
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:58,054
than just another
ordinary day together

27
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,060
and I will watch over
you until the end.

28
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:07,725
We should make chestnut rice

29
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,404
since both you and
Master Lee like it.

30
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:14,815
Master Lee?

31
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:18,657
He is currently at his
hut in Danhyanggok.

32
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,080
He was the one who
brought me here.

33
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:40,431
Did the Unanimous Assembly ask you
to take the ice stone out of Jang Uk?

34
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:42,061
I told them I could not

35
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:46,431
because there is another soul
shifter he has yet to catch.

36
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,809
I see you have decided
to let him catch you.

37
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,276
Then you should
go to Danhyanggok.

38
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,948
I am also responsible for how
things turned out for you two,

39
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:04,486
and I cannot sit back and do
nothing like I did before.

40
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:05,577
It is time

41
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,829
that I do my part.

42
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,299
What is it that you
have to do with us?

43
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,429
I did nothing when you were
a young master and a servant.

44
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:22,759
I also did not interfere when
you were a master and a pupil.

45
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:24,846
However,

46
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,019
I cannot sit by and watch
as one must be hunted

47
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,600
and the other must
be the hunter.

48
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:31,765
So I wish to put an end to
your current relationship.

49
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:37,985
You saved my life, so I will
accept whatever choice you make.

50
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,909
Then will you follow my
decision no matter what?

51
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:51,673
Then I want you two…

52
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,512
to have a wedding.

53
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,260
I shall be your witness.

54
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,736
I want you two to be
officially married.

55
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:13,603
Let us get ready.

56
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,864
The weather is nice, so let
us get it done and over with.

57
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:17,941
All right.

58
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:32,672
Listen, you two.

59
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,070
Is this a
matriculation ceremony?

60
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,455
Oh, do you wish to be my pupil?

61
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:39,712
Will you drink chaste herb tea

62
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:41,297
and practice chastity
starting today?

63
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:42,802
- No.
- No way.

64
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:44,593
This is a wedding.

65
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:46,599
You should be facing each other.

66
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,559
Oh, right.

67
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,729
A wedding ceremony is how
you announce your marriage

68
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:55,731
to the people around you.

69
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,194
But it is also to
inform the skies.

70
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,735
"We have decided
to be together."

71
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:03,908
"Therefore, no one
can set us apart."

72
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:05,278
That is what the message is.

73
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,623
Now, Jang Uk of the
Jang family and…

74
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:15,665
Come to think of it,

75
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:17,625
you have four names.

76
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:22,336
You were born as Cho Yeong, but
you grew up as the assassin, Naksu.

77
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:23,973
Then you lived as Mu-deok,

78
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:26,681
and now you are Jin Bu-yeon.

79
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:30,059
I never had a chance to live

80
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,733
with just one name.

81
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,478
Which name shall I call you by?

82
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,977
The name that my parents
gave me when I was born.

83
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,781
I would like to be
called Cho Yeong.

84
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,582
Uk and Yeong.

85
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,658
Your name means "light."

86
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,666
And your name means "shadow."

87
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,628
Light and shadow.

88
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:00,961
It may be that you two

89
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,053
were fated to meet
from the start.

90
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:09,801
Let us now begin the wedding
ceremony of Jang Uk and Cho Yeong.

91
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:23,483
It is a wedding drink.

92
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,372
If you drink that,

93
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,037
it means we are
officially married.

94
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,837
Go on. Drink up.

95
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:51,224
If you turn this off, I
will take you with me.

96
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,467
You and I…

97
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,120
have liked each other
for a long time.

98
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:04,733
I shall always stay by
your side at this distance.

99
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:07,612
That is my promise.

100
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:12,235
I must be going crazy…

101
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,369
because of you.

102
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,615
I found another use for you.

103
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:21,326
After all, you are offering
to substitute for her.

104
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:25,955
But this is my hand
that you are holding,

105
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:30,259
and it will be me who holds you
and puts you to bed at night.

106
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:37,135
So when you are looking at
me, see me for who I am.

107
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,309
You look pretty.

108
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,539
You told me to see
you for who you were.

109
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:47,239
That is what I am trying to do.

110
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,318
I will also…

111
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:54,619
boast to everyone that you lit up
a dark path for me late at night.

112
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,578
Sure, go ahead.

113
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,421
I plan to find my own room.

114
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:09,166
I will find out who I really am and
decorate my room with my own traits.

115
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:11,883
I hope…

116
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,678
that makes it easier
for you to find me.

117
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:19,016
I will keep you warm and
help you rest comfortably.

118
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:21,845
I just pine for you.

119
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,362
That is why I came to see you.

120
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,200
I liked you from the start.

121
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,541
I knew the moment I saw you.

122
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:40,827
You are my husband.

123
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,341
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

124
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,133
You have informed the skies
through this ceremony,

125
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:52,934
so I wish you a
long life together.

126
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:59,224
Among all the married couples I
have seen through my entire life,

127
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,676
you two are the dearest.

128
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:23,663
I promised you

129
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,577
that I would bring you up here.

130
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,787
You were right. You can
see the world from up here.

131
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:31,711
It is nice.

132
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,393
Now that I look
at you like this,

133
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,882
it feels as if it has been a
long time since we last met,

134
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,356
but it also feels as
if we met yesterday.

135
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,573
It feels strange.

136
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:06,794
It feels like I held your
hand a long time ago.

137
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:11,509
But it also feels like I only recently
held it for the very first time.

138
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,224
Everything is clear to me now.

139
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:19,552
Deep down inside,

140
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,933
I recognized you from the start.

141
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,063
Just like when we first met.

142
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,318
I recognized the girl with
the blue marks in her eyes.

143
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:36,945
I recognized you.

144
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:58,180
Do you think Bu-yeon is
with Jang Uk right now?

145
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:01,758
Jang Uk will have
gone to find her

146
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,824
because of what she said
at the Unanimous Assembly.

147
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,058
Why did you not stop her?

148
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,192
Jang Uk got rid of Jin Mu,

149
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,403
and Bu-yeon found
the Jinyowon Plaque.

150
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,980
Regardless of anything,

151
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,568
the truth is that they
both protected Jinyowon.

152
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:22,371
I would like to think that she is
looking out for the two of them.

153
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,620
"She"?

154
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:27,745
I asked them how they
first met each other here.

155
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:31,380
They said someone had opened
the door to this place.

156
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,379
Do you really believe

157
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:36,261
that her soul remained in
Jinyowon along with the ice stone

158
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:38,168
and was reborn as my daughter?

159
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,344
How is that even possible?

160
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,966
My existence is proof
that it is possible.

161
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:50,638
I am alive because I entered
the dead body of a young boy.

162
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,033
She may have done the same.

163
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:59,108
Let us say you are right
and that it is possible.

164
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:03,985
What could be the reason
that she chose to stay?

165
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,584
I am sure there is a good reason

166
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:10,327
why she chose to stay with the ice
stone instead of leaving 200 years ago.

167
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,457
It sounds like you know
what that reason may be.

168
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:20,014
She must have protected the ice stone
because it was going to be used one day.

169
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:26,928
Jin Seol-ran and my master, Seo
Gyeong, went through the Great Chaos,

170
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:32,055
and I fear that the same kind
of chaos may occur once again.

171
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,404
The fire bird is safe.

172
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,895
Jin Mu is dead.

173
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,308
Heo Yeom stocked this place
with food and firewood

174
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,935
knowing I would come
back here one day.

175
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,648
It will be enough
to last you a month.

176
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:21,439
A month?

177
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,397
What is the matter?
Is it too short?

178
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,582
I did not come hoping to
spend a lifetime together.

179
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:32,409
I just came to stay by her side
until the very last moment.

180
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:35,826
That could last a
month, two weeks,

181
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,206
or even just a few days.

182
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,131
But I decided not to keep count.

183
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,839
I am going to believe

184
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,550
that we will always
have tomorrow.

185
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:52,140
How many of Naksu's
memories have returned?

186
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:54,976
There is still

187
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:58,146
a memory she does not recall.

188
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,731
You said you were dying to know

189
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,645
how I felt at that
last moment with you.

190
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,694
That moment will probably be

191
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:12,412
the very last memory
that comes back to me.

192
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:21,415
When I recall that last memory…

193
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,434
I will give you
a sign like this.

194
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:32,309
Then I will tell
you what I remember.

195
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:36,808
It will be…

196
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:42,072
my last love letter to you.

197
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,910
In the past, I
could not understand

198
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,200
why Master Seo Gyeong kept
his love letter unsent

199
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:54,446
despite having written it.

200
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:59,076
But now I understand why he would
have been unable to send that letter.

201
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,916
That love letter was
for Jin Seol-ran.

202
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:08,054
I hope the love you have for each
other will somehow reach her as well.

203
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,931
Heo Yeom also got
me new bedding.

204
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,675
Maybe it is in storage.

205
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,310
Jin Seol-ran?

206
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,506
What is this barrier?
Did you create it?

207
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:11,779
That is the fire bird.

208
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,706
The fire bird will
dry out the world.

209
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:30,471
I hoped that something so
tragic would never happen.

210
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:35,010
But the foolish greed of humans will
lead the world to burn to ashes.

211
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:36,763
The fire bird

212
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,137
is going to escape?

213
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,394
I just showed you

214
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:44,097
what is going to
happen to this world.

215
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:48,862
I foresaw this happening
a very long time ago.

216
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:50,862
You are able to see the future?

217
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,029
Who are you?

218
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:54,655
A priestess?

219
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,491
You used the yin-and-yang
jade to summon me, right?

220
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:01,407
I could not leave, for I was scared
that the world would fall into ruin.

221
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,847
But I only ended up contributing
to the summoning of the fire bird

222
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,287
and making this world burn.

223
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:09,964
I am not capable of
stopping what will happen.

224
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:12,798
It can only be
stopped by the man

225
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:16,013
who was born against the laws
of nature under the King's Star.

226
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:23,733
I have been hiding under the shadow
that was created by your light.

227
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:28,145
Now I plan to cast that shadow
aside and step out into the world.

228
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,652
Cast the shadow aside

229
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,073
and step out into the world?

230
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:35,446
Does that mean

231
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,990
you are Jin Bu-yeon?

232
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:41,661
That is right.

233
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:45,036
That is the name I was
given when I was reborn.

234
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:49,962
Jin Bu-yeon attracted
your shadow,

235
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:52,295
used it,

236
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,339
and will make it disappear.

237
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:59,221
The world I foresaw will
come no matter what.

238
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,304
And when it does,

239
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,730
tragic events will occur.

240
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:17,818
Just as Jin Seol-ran helped Seo Gyeong
stop the Great Chaos a long time ago,

241
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:21,539
you are the only person
who can stop the fire bird,

242
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:26,869
and Jin Bu-yeon must come into this
world to help you achieve that.

243
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,575
Jin Bu-yeon attracted
your shadow,

244
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:04,827
used it,

245
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,079
and will make it disappear.

246
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,373
Did you meet…

247
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:12,877
Jin Bu-yeon?

248
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,218
Yes.

249
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,019
I ended up seeing something

250
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,355
that is inevitable.

251
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:39,034
According to Jin Mu's plan,

252
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:41,322
we must first take the
fire bird out of Jinyowon.

253
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:44,116
Then we must confiscate
the Jinyowon Plaque

254
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,121
by gathering another
Unanimous Assembly.

255
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:48,253
We need to keep
Songrim out of it,

256
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,920
but how will we justify it?

257
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:52,378
We must use Jang Uk
as our justification.

258
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:55,668
He disobeyed the King's
command, did he not?

259
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,380
That is right.

260
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,720
When should we gather
the Unanimous Assembly?

261
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,183
Are you all right?

262
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,540
Forget about the Unanimous
Assembly and the Jinyowon Plaque.

263
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,213
We have no time to waste.

264
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:36,634
We must go to Jinyowon at once
and bring out the fire bird.

265
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:37,802
We must do it now!

266
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:43,764
Why did His Majesty gather the mages
of the Unanimous Assembly at this hour?

267
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,304
I do not know why,

268
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,181
but I think one of the
mages is a soul shifter.

269
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:51,272
He absorbed the energy
of one of the eunuchs.

270
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:54,768
A soul shifter is in the palace?

271
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:56,984
Then His Majesty is in danger.

272
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:59,145
- We must stop him.
- It is hard to believe,

273
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:00,574
but I think that soul shifter

274
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,172
is someone you know,
Your Royal Highness.

275
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:04,196
Someone I know?

276
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:07,446
Who?

277
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:09,702
It is me, Your Royal Highness.

278
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:19,837
You are the Queen's relative
from Seoho Fortress, are you not?

279
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:22,275
I see you fail to recognize me
because my appearance has changed.

280
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,339
It is me.

281
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,585
Your long-time master

282
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:26,967
and Gwanju of Cheonbugwan,

283
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:28,763
Jin Mu.

284
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:30,598
Jin Mu?

285
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:35,437
How can you be Jin Mu?

286
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,400
I shifted into another
body when I was in Gwido.

287
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:39,611
You shifted your soul?

288
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:42,571
His Majesty sent someone for
me, so I was able to live.

289
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,072
His Majesty saved you?

290
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:46,784
I came back to help the King
and the Unanimous Assembly

291
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,195
achieve their goal.

292
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:49,283
Shut your mouth!

293
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:51,429
His Majesty would never
see eye to eye with you.

294
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:53,083
Jin Mu is telling the truth.

295
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:02,407
Jin Mu will be standing with
me and the Unanimous Assembly.

296
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:03,628
Your Majesty.

297
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:05,585
Jin Mu, did you say
you wish to take away

298
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:07,585
the Crown Prince's Gold Plaque?

299
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:10,513
Yes, Your Majesty.

300
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:15,943
His Royal Highness
stabbed me in the back,

301
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,520
so I should return the favor.

302
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:22,861
I shall take away the
Crown Prince's Gold Plaque.

303
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:27,569
You are no longer the
heir to the throne.

304
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:36,212
Keep him locked up in here
until I say otherwise.

305
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:37,790
Yes, Your Majesty.

306
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:41,797
Your Majesty, you are
being fooled by him.

307
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,224
Your Majesty!

308
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:02,523
Jin Mu.

309
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:08,106
What are you trying to do by fooling
the King and Unanimous Assembly?

310
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:10,446
I am merely picking
up where I left off.

311
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,504
I shall head to Jinyowon
and bring out the fire bird.

312
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:41,687
Is Young Lady Bu-yeon

313
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:43,767
also not here?

314
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:47,283
Is she with Young Master Jang?

315
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:49,778
Lady Jin.

316
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,029
What is going on between them?

317
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:57,003
I cannot tell you
anything right now.

318
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:59,924
Time will solve everything,

319
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,578
so please have
patience and wait.

320
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:05,297
Does that mean you
know where they are?

321
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,007
Maidservant Kim.

322
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:13,045
My mother still has
not fully recovered

323
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:14,926
after helping Young Master Seo.

324
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:18,426
She needs to rest, so
please go back home.

325
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:24,861
Lady Jin, the mages of the
Unanimous Assembly are here.

326
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:26,565
What?

327
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:35,695
What do you think you are doing?

328
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:38,624
How dare you attempt to enter
Jinyowon without my permission!

329
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,871
Apologies, Lady Jin.

330
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:46,457
We need to take out the artifact
that is needed for the lake's rite.

331
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:48,338
Open the door to Jinyowon.

332
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:51,221
You came barging in here at this
late hour to get the artifact

333
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:52,679
for the lake's rite?

334
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,389
The royal family
has approved it,

335
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:57,138
so all you need to
do is open that door.

336
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,312
I cannot do that.

337
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:01,228
I cannot open that door even
if the royal family orders it.

338
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:05,187
Have you forgotten about
the Jinyowon Plaque?

339
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:09,652
All the mages of the Unanimous
Assembly are here except for Songrim,

340
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,068
so we shall
confiscate the plaque.

341
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,486
Give us the plaque.

342
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:16,572
This is ridiculous.

343
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:17,948
I cannot let you do that.

344
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:19,374
Enough!

345
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,330
I told you we have no time.

346
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:41,348
- Mother!
- Make one more step and your mother dies.

347
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:44,314
Ho-gyeong.

348
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:47,233
Your brother has shifted souls.

349
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:52,488
Open that door before I suck out
all the energy of the Jin family

350
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:53,739
that you are so proud of.

351
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:56,737
Jin Cho-yeon!

352
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,117
Open that door.

353
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:04,157
Or I will drain your mother's energy
until she is as dry as firewood.

354
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:06,498
Mother…

355
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,375
Open the door.

356
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,463
Do it now!

357
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:17,142
He is a soul shifter.

358
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:19,218
If he drains Lady Jin's
energy, she will die!

359
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,434
Hurry and open the door!

360
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:01,045
Quickly go to Songrim
and ask them for help.

361
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:02,928
Hurry.

362
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:07,768
Mother!

363
00:28:57,402 --> 00:29:00,492
Mother, are you all right?

364
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:08,253
Is that the fire bird's egg?

365
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,173
- What is that sound?
- What is that?

366
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:17,212
Jinyowon must be collapsing now
that the fire bird's egg is out.

367
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,762
We must leave now.

368
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:30,642
Ho-gyeong.

369
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:35,859
I could have absorbed all your
energy, but I could not bear to.

370
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:39,241
Anything that belongs to Jinyowon
makes me sick to my stomach.

371
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:46,081
Mother.

372
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:47,659
Your wound is deep.

373
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:51,662
We cannot let them
take the fire bird.

374
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:55,170
Go to Songrim right now
and ask them for help.

375
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,551
Jin Cho-yeon! Go now!

376
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:00,631
Hurry!

377
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:03,383
Yes, Mother.

378
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:23,662
Jinyowon…

379
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:25,739
is collapsing.

380
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:38,085
No.

381
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:39,545
No…

382
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,178
Lady Jin.

383
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:52,059
Lady Jin, are you all right?

384
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:55,401
Please take me inside Jinyowon.

385
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:57,308
If Jinyowon collapses,

386
00:30:57,397 --> 00:31:00,897
all the relics
inside will escape.

387
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,860
I must use my divine
powers to keep them there.

388
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:14,496
Hold onto me.

389
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,247
I will take you inside.

390
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:37,899
My lord.

391
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,791
- Young Master Park.
- Are you all right?

392
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:43,395
The mages of the Unanimous
Assembly took the fire bird.

393
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:45,704
Jinyowon is going to collapse.

394
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,744
I will check on Jinyowon.

395
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,657
Go and follow the mages
who took the fire bird.

396
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:57,713
- Yes, my lord.
- The fire bird is a dangerous relic,

397
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,330
so I shall go with
Young Master Park.

398
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,457
My mother is severely injured.

399
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:04,086
Please help her, Lord Park.

400
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:05,881
All right.

401
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:13,305
Uncle.

402
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:29,698
Where is Lady Jin?

403
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:32,451
She went inside to keep
the relics from escaping.

404
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:35,043
Maidservant Kim went
in there with her.

405
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,329
Maidservant Kim?

406
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:40,384
Maidservant Kim is
inside Jinyowon?

407
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:50,051
Maidservant Kim!

408
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,514
Maidservant Kim,
are you in there?

409
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:55,848
Lord Park, I am in here!

410
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:04,941
The relics are escaping!

411
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:06,733
If it collapses,

412
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,358
all the other dangerous
relics will escape as well!

413
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:12,534
I must seal the door.

414
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,198
Maidservant Kim,
hurry up and leave.

415
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:16,584
If you do not, you will die.

416
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:17,661
What?

417
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:21,746
The relics are
starting to escape.

418
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,383
I must seal the door!

419
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:26,336
What about you?

420
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,640
Maidservant Kim!

421
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:41,192
It is going to collapse soon!

422
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:45,186
If we do not seal the door, we will
not be able to stop the relics!

423
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,273
No!

424
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:49,239
I cannot seal the door.
Maidservant Kim is still…

425
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:55,366
My wife is still in there.

426
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,076
My lord!

427
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:02,748
Seal…

428
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:04,793
the door.

429
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,483
Maidservant Kim!

430
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:26,113
We cannot let this
place collapse.

431
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:28,273
So please…

432
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:30,901
seal the door.

433
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,453
I understand.

434
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,620
My lord.

435
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:43,657
I will be all right.

436
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:47,462
So seal the door.

437
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:50,247
Hurry!

438
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:53,587
My lord! It is
about to collapse!

439
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,711
Even if you decide
to seal that door,

440
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:34,045
I know how heartbreaking
it will be for you,

441
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,302
so it does not upset me so much.

442
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,287
I do not mind it.

443
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:48,786
Yeon…

444
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:55,375
Yeon…

445
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,538
Lord Park Jin.

446
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,620
Do not fall into despair.

447
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,999
You still have a
chance to save her.

448
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:38,836
I will give you the power
to save the person you love.

449
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:04,874
Your Majesty…

450
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:07,538
is this what you

451
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:11,081
and the Unanimous
Assembly both want?

452
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:12,463
I told you.

453
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:15,539
Everyone wants to share
the power of the ice stone.

454
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:18,296
It would be greedy of Songrim
to keep it for themselves.

455
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:22,469
The power should be divided among
the powerful mage families of Daeho

456
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:25,850
and used wisely
through common consent.

457
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:27,308
So you plan to awaken

458
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:33,226
the dangerous fire bird
just to achieve that?

459
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,651
The lake's rite
will bring us rain

460
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,320
and help us get the ice stone.

461
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:40,029
Then we will seal it back.

462
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:44,069
What about the world that will
burn to ashes because of it?

463
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,657
Does that not matter to you?

464
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:50,370
All things require sacrifice.

465
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:53,000
Worrying about
insignificant things

466
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,330
only prevents us from
achieving what we want.

467
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:57,378
Do you not wish

468
00:38:58,252 --> 00:38:59,462
to save Maidservant Kim?

469
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:03,383
Do not be a hypocrite and pretend
that is not what you want.

470
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:11,097
Evil…

471
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:15,895
always does what it wants
without ever stopping.

472
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:18,936
But why is it that virtue

473
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:24,322
always needs to prove
itself over and over again?

474
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:28,948
Yes.

475
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,950
I do wish to save her.

476
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:36,118
I would do anything to
save her, even if it meant

477
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,456
I would lose my sanity.

478
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:41,801
But even so,

479
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:44,422
I will…

480
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:49,891
stop you from getting
what you want.

481
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:53,889
Not a single one of you

482
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:57,442
has the right to laugh at me…

483
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:02,226
and call me…

484
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,152
a hypocrite.

485
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,396
Stop right now…

486
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:50,318
or I will break the
barrier of the fire bird.

487
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:09,689
This place is
going to burn down.

488
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:11,572
We need to leave.

489
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:23,892
He fought against the
representatives of eight families

490
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,076
and still made it this far.

491
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:27,801
He really was a
highly skilled mage.

492
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,260
What a waste.

493
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:33,128
If he held hands with us, I would
have helped him shift souls.

494
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:35,177
But he willingly chose death,

495
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:36,851
so there is nothing we can do.

496
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:57,675
Lord Park!

497
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:02,637
- Lord Park!
- Lord Park!

498
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:07,230
- Lady Jin!
- Lord Park!

499
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:12,436
Lord Park!

500
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:21,824
Uk.

501
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:23,701
Uk…

502
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:25,866
Uk, Jin is…

503
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:27,294
Jin is…

504
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:32,585
- Lady Jin!
- Lord Park!

505
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:15,126
Last night,

506
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:18,128
the fire bird was
taken from Jinyowon.

507
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:21,257
Lady Jin and Maidservant
Kim went inside Jinyowon

508
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:23,643
in an attempt to stop
the relics from escaping…

509
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:27,136
and passed away.

510
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:31,484
Not even Jin Cho-yeon could open
the collapsed door to Jinyowon

511
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,106
so we could not
collect their bodies.

512
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:35,229
Because of that…

513
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:38,277
their coffins are empty.

514
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:42,574
As for Lord Park, he tried to stop them
from breaking the fire bird's barrier,

515
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:45,994
but the fire bird's energy
set the place on fire,

516
00:45:46,743 --> 00:45:47,913
and he passed away there.

517
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:50,788
The place completely
burned down.

518
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:53,538
The only thing we found
there was his sword.

519
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:56,335
I was locked up after they
took away my Gold Plaque.

520
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,685
I narrowly escaped when
the fire broke out.

521
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:02,259
My father, the King
of this country,

522
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:05,389
is with the Unanimous Assembly.

523
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:06,971
This all happened

524
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:11,885
because Jin Mu was able to shift
his soul into Seo Yun-o's body.

525
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:15,019
I would barge into Cheonbugwan
right this instant,

526
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:18,322
but they have the fire bird.

527
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:22,571
We cannot make rash decisions.

528
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:25,164
If people find out that
the fire bird got out,

529
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,580
there will be extreme chaos.

530
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:28,988
Let us quietly hold
their funerals.

531
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:31,327
Then we must stop them
from waking the fire bird.

532
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:33,916
The fire bird will awaken.

533
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:38,002
I was told that

534
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:40,464
it is going to happen
no matter what.

535
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:43,633
However…

536
00:46:46,803 --> 00:46:48,223
these three did not pass away.

537
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:55,811
If the disaster created by
human greed was foreseen,

538
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:58,726
the will to stop it
can become a variable…

539
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:02,533
and change the outcome.

540
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:22,296
Jin will be all right.

541
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:25,471
Do not cry too much.

542
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:27,051
All right.

543
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:44,316
Lady Jin, you have used up
too much of your energy.

544
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:48,238
Not only did they
take the fire bird,

545
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:52,288
but I also failed to
stop all the relics…

546
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:55,584
from escaping Jinyowon.

547
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:58,584
You put your life at
risk and did your best.

548
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:03,506
Was it Bu-yeon who
entered Jinyowon…

549
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:06,220
while it was collapsing?

550
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,300
Yes.

551
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:10,716
Jinyowon's door was built
by Jin Seol-ran as well.

552
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:16,055
Bu-yeon created a door that allowed
her to enter Jinyowon from Danhyanggok.

553
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:27,992
While she entered Jinyowon and
stopped it from collapsing,

554
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:32,372
I followed her instructions
and went to find the fire bird.

555
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:37,002
I could not find the fire bird.

556
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:40,213
But fortunately, I
was able to save Jin.

557
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:45,090
Does that mean Naksu
no longer lives

558
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,130
in that body?

559
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:49,466
She left the body,

560
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:53,514
which led Bu-yeon to completely
regain her divine powers.

561
00:49:01,563 --> 00:49:03,363
It took you so long to
find each other again.

562
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,819
But you were not even
given a full day together.

563
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:32,549
The yin-and-yang jade

564
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:35,723
is shared by couples in
order to stay together.

565
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:37,306
So we can no longer…

566
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:42,524
be sharing this.

567
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:13,675
When I recall that last memory…

568
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,346
I will give you
a sign like this.

569
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:26,861
I guess we were…

570
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:31,574
never fated to recognize
each other at first sight.

571
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:35,283
My birth led to
your father's death.

572
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:38,695
Then you killed
me to avenge him.

573
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,120
You are right.

574
00:50:42,038 --> 00:50:43,868
Judging by the
fate that we share…

575
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:47,342
we probably should not have met.

576
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:49,253
But…

577
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:52,469
fate was not what brought us…

578
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:55,549
to recognize each
other at first sight.

579
00:50:57,053 --> 00:50:58,053
We…

580
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:02,604
lightened up each other's lives
when we needed each other the most.

581
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:05,230
We embraced the shadows
that came with it…

582
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:08,772
and chose to love each other.

583
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:11,776
So now…

584
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:15,549
there is only one
reply I can give you

585
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:20,870
in our last moment together.

586
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:31,462
I love you.

587
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:54,090
Songrim is mourning, and the
fire bird is in our hands.

588
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:56,970
Neither Jang Uk nor Songrim
will be able to do anything now.

589
00:52:57,674 --> 00:53:00,974
Tonight, I will wake the fire
bird and perform the lake's rite.

590
00:53:01,052 --> 00:53:04,262
Then after tonight, I will be able
to use the power of the ice stone

591
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:06,977
and finally abandon
this weak, ill body.

592
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:11,772
People could show up
to hinder our plan,

593
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:14,083
so please gather all the guards
protecting Daeho Fortress

594
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:15,647
and have them
protect Cheonbugwan.

595
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:18,614
I will send my army
to Cheonbugwan.

596
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:20,565
I want you to safely
awaken the fire bird

597
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:22,986
and bring me the ice stone.

598
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:30,367
Your Royal Highness,

599
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:32,877
please stop the King
from mobilizing his army.

600
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:39,628
But I no longer have the Gold Plaque
that gives me power over the army.

601
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:46,931
Use this.

602
00:53:48,683 --> 00:53:50,523
This was left for
you by the late king.

603
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:53,483
This country does
not need a king

604
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:57,033
who does not care whether or
not the world burns to ashes.

605
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:00,605
It needs a king who
wishes to stop it.

606
00:54:10,538 --> 00:54:12,498
I already stole
your King's Star.

607
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:15,042
Now I will even be
using your Gold Plaque.

608
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:16,835
Jang Uk.

609
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:22,883
Have you really never dreamed of
becoming the most powerful person

610
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:24,927
in this world?

611
00:54:27,263 --> 00:54:28,893
I have already climbed

612
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:32,846
to the very peak of this
world with the person…

613
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:35,357
I made that promise with.

614
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:38,565
That is…

615
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:42,815
more than enough for me.

616
00:54:56,751 --> 00:54:58,801
While we perform
the lake's rite,

617
00:54:58,878 --> 00:55:02,468
the King will send his army
to Cheonbugwan and protect it.

618
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:04,509
Jang Uk and Songrim
might come to stop us.

619
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,760
What are you worried about?
We have the fire bird.

620
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:09,056
You saw Park Jin.

621
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:12,349
He could not do anything
despite his strength and power.

622
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:15,274
I guess you are right. Once we
break the fire bird's barrier,

623
00:55:15,353 --> 00:55:17,773
Jang Uk and Songrim
will become helpless.

624
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:19,566
Awakening the fire
bird is dangerous.

625
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:23,280
If the flames burst toward us
while we break the barrier,

626
00:55:23,361 --> 00:55:25,861
we will instantly
be reduced to ashes.

627
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:28,277
If the fire bird fails to
fly after being disturbed

628
00:55:28,366 --> 00:55:30,326
and its energy of fire bursts…

629
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:34,714
all of Daeho Fortress will burn.

630
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:37,130
They will not be
able to do anything…

631
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:42,228
fearing that the fire
bird might awaken.

632
00:55:49,345 --> 00:55:52,175
I am going to go to Cheonbugwan
and awaken the fire bird.

633
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:57,903
You are going to awaken the fire
bird, not stop it from awakening?

634
00:55:57,979 --> 00:56:00,609
If the awakening of the
fire bird is inevitable,

635
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:04,280
it is better to let it happen
while we still have control over it

636
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,820
so we can change the outcome.

637
00:56:07,822 --> 00:56:09,300
At the place where
the energy of the sky

638
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:11,454
reached the ground and
created a huge form of energy,

639
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:14,138
I will get rid of the fire bird that
is filled with the energy of fire.

640
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:15,292
In order to do that,

641
00:56:16,372 --> 00:56:17,672
I must awaken the fire bird.

642
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:38,162
I checked the energy of the sky
through the constellation basin.

643
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:41,226
The energy of fire will be strongest
between 7 and 9 p.m. tonight.

644
00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:45,154
Once that time comes, I
shall begin the lake's rite.

645
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:59,705
Cheonbugwan will begin performing the
rite between 7 and 9 p.m. tonight.

646
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:00,791
During that time?

647
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:05,840
Have the guards protecting Daeho
Fortress headed to Cheonbugwan?

648
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:09,552
The leader of the guards will be
here soon to give you a report.

649
00:57:09,634 --> 00:57:10,634
Good.

650
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:45,752
Is it not time yet?

651
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:48,967
Why is the leader of the
guards not here to report yet?

652
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:50,628
The guards will not
be going anywhere.

653
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:00,851
I…

654
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:04,605
Withdrew the order you
gave, Your Majesty.

655
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:06,109
What is that?

656
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:08,647
Is that not a Gold Plaque?

657
00:58:11,362 --> 00:58:13,842
It is the Gold Plaque of the man
you have feared all your life.

658
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:16,874
The man born under
the King's Star.

659
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:20,367
The King's Star?

660
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:21,995
The man born under
the King's Star

661
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:25,130
will stop what is
happening at Cheonbugwan.

662
00:58:28,254 --> 00:58:29,254
Father.

663
00:58:31,716 --> 00:58:33,796
It is time you step
down from the throne…

664
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:38,516
that kept you anxious
all your life.

665
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:44,983
What…

666
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:57,760
Relics that will ignite
the fire bird's energy

667
00:59:58,386 --> 00:59:59,966
are placed all over the canal.

668
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:02,095
We must find and
destroy them all.

669
01:00:02,181 --> 01:00:03,641
- Let us hurry.
- Yes, my lady.

670
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:15,648
Songrim forces have
entered Cheonbugwan.

671
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:18,909
It is not time yet,
but let us begin.

672
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:20,070
It is dangerous to rush it.

673
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:22,038
If the energy of fire
explodes, we will all die.

674
01:00:22,076 --> 01:00:23,996
If we lose the fire bird,
we will all be doomed.

675
01:00:24,078 --> 01:00:25,658
That is better than
burning to death.

676
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:27,462
Count me out.

677
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:41,257
No one here has the right to stop
this. Otherwise, you will die.

678
01:00:43,514 --> 01:00:44,514
Now…

679
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:47,555
I want all of you to
wake the fire bird!

680
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:49,234
Jin Mu is right.

681
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:52,772
Let us wake the fire bird
so we can get the ice stone.

682
01:01:13,711 --> 01:01:16,761
You were supposed to be careful.
Why is it suddenly awakening?

683
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:33,520
Jang Uk. What are you doing?

684
01:01:33,606 --> 01:01:35,606
I am helping you all
awaken the fire bird.

685
01:01:47,161 --> 01:01:48,331
Jang Uk, stop!

686
01:01:48,996 --> 01:01:52,916
If the energy of fire
explodes, it will kill us all!

687
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:57,170
Did you expect to live while
the world went up in flames?

688
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:01,876
I am sorry, but I
cannot allow that.

689
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:02,968
Jang Uk.

690
01:02:03,469 --> 01:02:05,629
Do you plan to kill everyone
in the Unanimous Assembly?

691
01:02:06,764 --> 01:02:09,184
Is this not the kind
of world you wanted?

692
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:13,442
Take a close look at what it is
like for someone with strength

693
01:02:15,314 --> 01:02:16,864
to gain and wield
even greater power.

694
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:37,252
Jang Uk.

695
01:02:46,512 --> 01:02:48,062
You were right, Jang Uk.

696
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:51,982
In a world where those with
strength gain greater power,

697
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:55,732
the weak will just perish.

698
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:03,130
Jin Bu-yeon safely
arrived at Cheonbugwan.

699
01:04:03,881 --> 01:04:07,091
She and Yul are waiting for the fire
bird by the constellation basin.

700
01:04:08,427 --> 01:04:09,427
All right.

701
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:12,810
Take this to Jin
Bu-yeon and tell her

702
01:04:13,724 --> 01:04:17,104
that I will be waiting
at Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.

703
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:28,740
I found Jang Uk's constellation plate
where the Crown Prince said it would be.

704
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:39,422
Is the fire bird safe?

705
01:04:45,923 --> 01:04:48,473
Jin Bu-yeon has regained
all of her divine powers.

706
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:49,931
And the fire bird is safe.

707
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:55,561
She will awaken it atop
the constellation basin.

708
01:04:59,937 --> 01:05:02,397
We got rid of all the relics
that would prevent the fire bird

709
01:05:02,481 --> 01:05:03,921
from going to Lake
Gyeongcheondaeho.

710
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:24,838
The star in the very center of
the Big Dipper is the King's Star.

711
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:30,248
Now she will wake the fire bird

712
01:05:31,719 --> 01:05:33,139
and send it to the King's Star.

713
01:05:33,804 --> 01:05:34,854
I heard that

714
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:38,811
the seven stars gather their energy
and send it to the King's Star.

715
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:41,403
But right now, there
are only six of us.

716
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:44,109
No, there are seven.

717
01:05:45,149 --> 01:05:46,819
There is one more person…

718
01:05:49,695 --> 01:05:51,025
who was always beside Uk.

719
01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:52,979
Now she will wake the fire bird

720
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:56,330
and send it to Uk at
Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.

721
01:06:46,544 --> 01:06:47,884
- How beautiful.
- What is that?

722
01:06:47,962 --> 01:06:50,012
- What is that?
- Do you know what that is?

723
01:06:50,589 --> 01:06:51,589
Look at that.

724
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:55,179
The fire bird is awake.

725
01:09:12,189 --> 01:09:13,819
Jang Uk did it.

726
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:16,401
The fire bird

727
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:18,650
has disappeared.

728
01:09:34,753 --> 01:09:36,303
- Jin Bu-yeon.
- Shaman.

729
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:37,380
Bu-yeon.

730
01:10:22,301 --> 01:10:24,051
To the light that
has saved the world,

731
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:28,269
I shall now return your shadow.

732
01:10:30,017 --> 01:10:32,057
A light that embraces a shadow

733
01:10:32,937 --> 01:10:36,017
will never be lost in darkness.

734
01:10:45,699 --> 01:10:47,659
1 YEAR LATER

735
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:49,123
Peekaboo.

736
01:10:49,870 --> 01:10:51,250
How lovely.

737
01:10:52,206 --> 01:10:55,666
I cannot believe two of these
precious babies came out at once.

738
01:10:55,751 --> 01:10:57,091
Peekaboo.

739
01:10:57,169 --> 01:10:58,589
How lovely.

740
01:10:58,671 --> 01:10:59,881
Peekaboo.

741
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:01,174
- How lovely.
- How lovely.

742
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:04,387
What are Dan and Gang
doing here again?

743
01:11:04,969 --> 01:11:05,969
Oh, dear.

744
01:11:06,637 --> 01:11:07,807
My goodness.

745
01:11:08,639 --> 01:11:09,639
There we go.

746
01:11:09,682 --> 01:11:12,102
Are you Gang or Dan?

747
01:11:12,184 --> 01:11:15,314
He came with his wife to leave them
here to visit his mother-in-law.

748
01:11:15,396 --> 01:11:17,686
They always ask you
to babysit for them

749
01:11:18,482 --> 01:11:19,532
and go on dates.

750
01:11:20,442 --> 01:11:21,362
What about us?

751
01:11:21,443 --> 01:11:22,953
We are newlyweds too.

752
01:11:23,570 --> 01:11:26,570
This is why we are never able to
go on trips to places far away.

753
01:11:27,157 --> 01:11:28,827
Stop babysitting for them.

754
01:11:28,909 --> 01:11:31,659
If you keep doing this,
they will never stop asking.

755
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:33,536
It is just for a while.

756
01:11:33,622 --> 01:11:36,502
What would you do if
they were Uk's babies?

757
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:42,672
- Would you still not babysit them?
- Young Master Jang?

758
01:11:44,466 --> 01:11:47,386
I can babysit 12 babies if
it is for Young Master Jang.

759
01:11:47,469 --> 01:11:50,429
Your young master still
comes first, right?

760
01:11:50,514 --> 01:11:52,734
He will forever be
your number one.

761
01:11:52,808 --> 01:11:54,768
Goodness, do not be jealous.

762
01:11:57,855 --> 01:11:59,145
What a relief.

763
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:01,691
They are both handsome because
they take after Young Lady Jin.

764
01:12:01,775 --> 01:12:05,065
They have long arms and legs
because they take after Dang-gu.

765
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:08,744
I know the babies are adorable but
do not babysit them all the time.

766
01:12:08,824 --> 01:12:09,954
Only once in a while.

767
01:12:12,411 --> 01:12:14,041
- Goodness.
- What is the matter?

768
01:12:14,621 --> 01:12:16,381
Maybe it is the honey
biscuits I ate earlier.

769
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:19,787
Is it…

770
01:12:22,046 --> 01:12:25,166
- Is it what I think it is?
- No, it cannot be.

771
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:40,856
Nothing is for sure yet.

772
01:12:45,527 --> 01:12:47,607
I have high
expectations for you.

773
01:12:49,239 --> 01:12:51,699
Next time, I hope
you have twin girls.

774
01:12:54,411 --> 01:12:58,711
Does that mean you are disappointed
that Gang and Dan are sons?

775
01:12:58,791 --> 01:13:01,231
I am not disappointed, but they
took their father's last name.

776
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:04,390
I am merely asking for a daughter
who will carry on our family line.

777
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:07,594
Uk told me not to dream
of having a daughter

778
01:13:07,674 --> 01:13:09,804
since they are planning
to give birth to one.

779
01:13:11,804 --> 01:13:14,104
Did you say they are
at North Fortress?

780
01:13:14,181 --> 01:13:18,441
They caught one at North Fortress,
then headed straight to Seoho Fortress.

781
01:13:18,519 --> 01:13:20,349
But I do not know
when they will return.

782
01:13:20,437 --> 01:13:23,187
They promised to return to
celebrate the twins' 100th day.

783
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:24,729
Right.

784
01:13:24,817 --> 01:13:28,607
Bu-yeon agreed to help out at Jeongjingak,
so they might return sooner than planned.

785
01:13:28,695 --> 01:13:31,485
What do you mean, Bu-yeon agreed
to help out at Jeongjingak?

786
01:13:31,573 --> 01:13:34,283
Jeongjingak is
recruiting new mages,

787
01:13:34,368 --> 01:13:36,788
and she promised Yul
to interview them.

788
01:13:36,870 --> 01:13:40,330
Jeongjingak is recruiting
mages through interviews?

789
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:42,786
Seo Yul is now in
charge of Jeongjingak,

790
01:13:42,876 --> 01:13:44,746
which was established
by Master Seo Gyeong.

791
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:47,507
He made that decision as the
new leader of Jeongjingak.

792
01:13:47,589 --> 01:13:49,629
QUALIFICATIONS ANYONE WITH
PASSION AND DETERMINATION

793
01:13:51,135 --> 01:13:55,215
Is this really how you plan to
recruit new mages for Jeongjingak?

794
01:13:55,305 --> 01:13:57,885
Then all sorts of
people will apply.

795
01:13:57,975 --> 01:14:00,954
Word has spread that Seo Yul is in charge
of gathering pupils at Jeongjingak.

796
01:14:00,978 --> 01:14:03,768
All the mages' children in the
capital are very excited about it.

797
01:14:03,856 --> 01:14:06,726
However, if we recruit them this way,
children from prestigious families

798
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:09,027
will most likely not
apply out of pride.

799
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:11,751
When Master Seo Gyeong built
Jeongjingak, he would have wanted more

800
01:14:12,197 --> 01:14:15,237
than for us to train children
from prestigious families.

801
01:14:15,826 --> 01:14:19,156
But not everyone has the
power to cast spells.

802
01:14:19,246 --> 01:14:21,036
I am not recruiting just anyone.

803
01:14:21,707 --> 01:14:24,287
I will pick people with
good energy and potential.

804
01:14:24,376 --> 01:14:28,836
And based on that, those two
were the ones that you picked?

805
01:14:35,846 --> 01:14:39,216
The most powerful priestess in Daeho
saw their energy and recommended them.

806
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:42,348
She even told me that if
Sun-i is trained well,

807
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:45,146
she could even outshine
her own husband, Jang Uk.

808
01:14:45,230 --> 01:14:47,610
She has the potential
to outshine Jang Uk?

809
01:14:47,691 --> 01:14:49,741
They are my first pupils.

810
01:14:49,818 --> 01:14:53,238
I will train them rigorously and
make sure they outperform Uk.

811
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:02,659
Seo Yul has always been
fixated on being the best,

812
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:04,998
even when he used to
train at Jeongjingak.

813
01:15:05,083 --> 01:15:09,843
Those two are going to have it tough
thanks to their persistent master.

814
01:15:09,922 --> 01:15:13,682
Anyway, what matters is that
Jin Bu-yeon vouched for them.

815
01:15:13,759 --> 01:15:15,429
So they must have
something special.

816
01:15:15,511 --> 01:15:19,011
I heard that she also
secretly takes part

817
01:15:19,097 --> 01:15:22,307
in interviewing potential
wives for His Majesty the King.

818
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:26,521
She interviews them?

819
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:35,573
Master Heo.

820
01:15:35,656 --> 01:15:37,696
Why are you staring
at Young Lady Heo?

821
01:15:37,783 --> 01:15:41,663
I am trying to see if
she is fit to be a queen.

822
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:43,618
A queen?

823
01:15:43,705 --> 01:15:47,745
A long time ago, I gave Jang
Uk my torrent of energy,

824
01:15:47,834 --> 01:15:52,304
and he promised to grant
me a wish in return.

825
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:54,631
Married couples are one
both in body and spirit,

826
01:15:54,716 --> 01:15:57,176
so if the wife takes part
in choosing the queen,

827
01:15:57,261 --> 01:15:59,971
I can ask them to
pick my granddaughter.

828
01:16:01,431 --> 01:16:04,391
But Master Heo. Young Lady Heo
is currently seeing someone.

829
01:16:05,352 --> 01:16:06,352
What?

830
01:16:07,062 --> 01:16:08,062
Who?

831
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:10,360
A young man once came
with a broken arm.

832
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:12,760
Since then, he brings flowers
for her every time he visits.

833
01:16:14,611 --> 01:16:15,651
Is that so?

834
01:16:17,614 --> 01:16:19,454
- What kind of man is he?
- He is handsome.

835
01:16:19,533 --> 01:16:21,493
He is as handsome
as Young Master Seo.

836
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:22,577
Really?

837
01:16:23,537 --> 01:16:25,867
I had no idea Yun-ok
was seeing someone.

838
01:16:26,915 --> 01:16:28,575
I am so proud of her.

839
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:31,627
Then instead of asking her to
pick my granddaughter as queen,

840
01:16:31,712 --> 01:16:34,302
I shall ask her to
interview that man.

841
01:16:34,381 --> 01:16:36,511
Picking a wife for His
Majesty is more urgent.

842
01:16:37,092 --> 01:16:39,432
He focuses only on taking
care of political affairs,

843
01:16:39,511 --> 01:16:41,511
and he frequently invites
Master Lee to the palace.

844
01:16:42,306 --> 01:16:43,596
Rumors say that His Majesty

845
01:16:43,682 --> 01:16:46,852
even may have appointed
Master Lee as his master.

846
01:16:46,935 --> 01:16:47,935
What?

847
01:16:48,645 --> 01:16:51,055
Does that mean he is
practicing chastity?

848
01:16:51,648 --> 01:16:54,528
They say the King of Daeho
has cut off his libido.

849
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:56,400
But then what about
his successor?

850
01:16:56,486 --> 01:16:58,066
Did you not hear the rumor?

851
01:16:58,155 --> 01:17:00,235
Rumor has it that the king
before the last had a son.

852
01:17:00,741 --> 01:17:03,041
Yes, they say that
his son is Jang Uk.

853
01:17:03,118 --> 01:17:06,498
No wonder Jang Uk was
always so extraordinary.

854
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:10,130
The moment I saw him beat
the Crown Prince in a fight,

855
01:17:10,208 --> 01:17:12,378
I knew there was something
special about him.

856
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:14,001
Should I also try
practicing chastity?

857
01:17:14,087 --> 01:17:15,917
Cut the nonsense.

858
01:17:16,006 --> 01:17:17,546
Those men are unbelievable.

859
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:19,763
His Majesty should
quickly get married

860
01:17:19,843 --> 01:17:22,053
so that people stop saying
he cut off his libido.

861
01:17:22,137 --> 01:17:24,737
I cannot believe people think that
I, the King, cut off my libido.

862
01:17:26,725 --> 01:17:27,845
That is surely

863
01:17:28,477 --> 01:17:31,727
the most absurd thing I have
heard since a bogus shaman told me

864
01:17:31,813 --> 01:17:33,273
to adopt a turtle as my son.

865
01:17:34,358 --> 01:17:35,688
- I am the King.
- Exactly.

866
01:17:35,776 --> 01:17:38,396
That is why you should
quickly find yourself a wife.

867
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:39,817
But Jin Bu-yeon promised

868
01:17:39,905 --> 01:17:43,325
to come back and send royal notices
to the women she already picked out.

869
01:17:43,408 --> 01:17:45,238
When will those two be back?

870
01:17:45,327 --> 01:17:49,207
What they are doing is also important,
and they still seem pretty busy.

871
01:17:49,790 --> 01:17:52,290
How many relics escaped
Jinyowon when it collapsed?

872
01:17:52,376 --> 01:17:53,956
A total of 31 escaped,

873
01:17:54,044 --> 01:17:56,254
and they have
captured 12 as of now.

874
01:17:56,338 --> 01:18:00,218
Among those, there is a mouse
that goes around in human form,

875
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:03,260
and a dangerous pipe
that lures children.

876
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:05,595
Amid them, a crock that spreads
rumors and causes strife,

877
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:09,981
and a crying frog that spreads
plagues are especially dangerous.

878
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:12,600
They will have to stay busy
in order to catch them all.

879
01:18:19,236 --> 01:18:20,446
Jang Uk will likely use that

880
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:23,739
as an excuse to reject my every offer
to make him the Gwanju of Cheonbugwan.

881
01:18:24,783 --> 01:18:27,203
I will suggest it once again
the next time I meet him.

882
01:18:27,786 --> 01:18:29,706
I will tell him to
drop by the palace

883
01:18:29,788 --> 01:18:32,248
since Your Majesty
misses him dearly.

884
01:18:37,045 --> 01:18:38,795
This is the pottery
that holds Gwiseo.

885
01:18:39,297 --> 01:18:42,467
Tell them to capture the
mouse and put it in here.

886
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:44,260
All right.

887
01:18:44,678 --> 01:18:48,598
I am relieved that you stopped
many relics from escaping.

888
01:18:49,391 --> 01:18:51,661
If the swarm of mosquitoes that
causes earthquakes had escaped,

889
01:18:51,685 --> 01:18:53,055
it would have been
very dangerous.

890
01:18:53,145 --> 01:18:56,435
I was able to live
that day thanks to her.

891
01:18:57,274 --> 01:18:58,274
Do you

892
01:18:59,234 --> 01:19:01,364
no longer feel agony
whenever you see her?

893
01:19:02,612 --> 01:19:04,162
Like you said,

894
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:08,829
if it was really Jin Seol-ran's soul
that was born through Bu-yeon's body,

895
01:19:08,910 --> 01:19:11,080
and she chose that girl
to protect that body

896
01:19:11,163 --> 01:19:12,833
as she left this world,

897
01:19:14,291 --> 01:19:18,711
I choose to believe that my
daughter is living on thanks to her.

898
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:27,430
This mouse eats the clippings of
someone who trims their nails at night

899
01:19:27,512 --> 01:19:29,812
and takes the appearance
of that person.

900
01:19:30,974 --> 01:19:35,404
It transforms to look just like
you, then goes to your house

901
01:19:35,979 --> 01:19:38,319
and eats your parents alive!

902
01:19:42,819 --> 01:19:43,819
So…

903
01:19:44,946 --> 01:19:49,736
always be careful where you
throw away your nail clippings.

904
01:19:52,829 --> 01:19:56,079
If you are scared, you can go and
pray to the tree at Danhyanggok.

905
01:19:56,166 --> 01:19:59,416
There is a gigantic
tree in Danhyanggok,

906
01:19:59,503 --> 01:20:03,633
and when there is a full moon, two
people appear on top of that tree.

907
01:20:03,715 --> 01:20:07,715
They saved my big sister when
she was being chased by a tiger.

908
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:11,433
They also summoned fireflies and
lit up the dark path for her.

909
01:20:12,015 --> 01:20:14,015
- Really?
- Is that true?

910
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:17,230
Do they show up there often?

911
01:20:17,312 --> 01:20:20,612
Yes, I heard the man is very tall
and the woman is very beautiful.

912
01:20:20,690 --> 01:20:23,320
They are a married couple.

913
01:20:23,401 --> 01:20:25,451
He is a bright light
that protects the world,

914
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:29,952
and she is a shadow that protects him by
embracing the darkness surrounding him.

915
01:20:39,709 --> 01:20:40,789
Darling.

916
01:20:40,877 --> 01:20:43,917
How long are you going to
make me carry you up here?

917
01:20:44,005 --> 01:20:45,005
For eternity.

918
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:47,801
- For eternity?
- You promised.

919
01:20:48,385 --> 01:20:49,385
Right.

920
01:20:50,053 --> 01:20:52,683
What is the matter? Are you
already tired of doing it?

921
01:20:52,764 --> 01:20:54,684
- No, of course not.
- Forget it. Let us go down.

922
01:20:54,724 --> 01:20:55,894
No, wait.

923
01:20:58,436 --> 01:21:01,266
It is not that I am
tired of doing it.

924
01:21:01,356 --> 01:21:03,316
You were once a mage
who mastered Chisu.

925
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:06,700
So I am merely telling
you to challenge yourself.

926
01:21:06,778 --> 01:21:09,238
There is no need, for I
possess divine powers.

927
01:21:09,823 --> 01:21:11,123
You want me to train again?

928
01:21:12,033 --> 01:21:14,453
No way. Never. I get sick
just thinking about it.

929
01:21:14,536 --> 01:21:16,906
Gosh, back when
you were my master,

930
01:21:16,997 --> 01:21:18,957
did you not always
scold me for being lazy?

931
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:21,540
You were able to come this far
thanks to your great master.

932
01:21:21,626 --> 01:21:24,626
- What?
- Be grateful and treat her well.

933
01:21:25,422 --> 01:21:26,422
All right, fine.

934
01:21:27,215 --> 01:21:30,005
So did you find the creature
you were looking for?

935
01:21:30,677 --> 01:21:32,217
- Did you see it?
- Yes.

936
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:33,888
I saw it.

937
01:21:35,849 --> 01:21:37,309
It is in the west of the forest.

938
01:21:44,816 --> 01:21:47,186
It is a cat, a wily beast
that escaped from Jinyowon.

939
01:21:47,861 --> 01:21:49,031
A cat?

940
01:21:54,576 --> 01:21:57,576
Hey, I thought you
said it was a cat?

941
01:21:58,288 --> 01:22:01,628
That growl sounds like it may
be strong enough to eat a tiger.

942
01:22:02,292 --> 01:22:04,752
It is as big as an elephant.

943
01:22:04,836 --> 01:22:06,086
That is going to be

944
01:22:07,088 --> 01:22:08,668
one cute cat.

945
01:22:19,559 --> 01:22:20,729
Stay close to me.

946
01:22:29,152 --> 01:22:30,152
Here it comes.

947
01:22:31,738 --> 01:22:32,908
Go and take care of it.

948
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:50,530
