1
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,328
Thank you for the tour.

2
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:39,622
- Please let me know if you are interested.
- Sure.

3
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:47,714
This place is
right between Jinyowon and Songrim.

4
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:50,675
The roof tiles and the floors are clean.

5
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:53,344
This is the best house we have seen.

6
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:56,306
Do you not think there are too many rooms?

7
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,141
They will have children soon.

8
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:01,269
A son will take the surname Park
and lead Songrim,

9
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:04,939
and a daughter will take the surname Jin
and lead Jinyowon.

10
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,503
They will need to bear many children.

11
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,987
I am glad I asked you to come
on this house tour with me.

12
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:14,866
I will decide on the house you prefer.

13
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,076
Sure.

14
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:20,789
To be honest,

15
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:25,627
I do not wish to live in a big house.

16
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:29,130
I would much rather prefer a cozy house

17
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:33,468
where my husband and I
can live happily together.

18
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:38,807
It would be nice to have a small garden
where I can plant my favorite flowers.

19
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:42,894
You do like flowers, do you not?

20
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,773
How about planting some balsam?

21
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:51,027
My husband and I could dye
each other's fingernails with its flowers.

22
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:56,741
It would be wonderful
to live such a happy life together.

23
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:01,496
I will look for a house

24
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:04,332
that befits your description.

25
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:11,506
Pardon?

26
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:15,051
I will get a house with a small garden

27
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,804
and plant balsam seeds.

28
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:21,224
I will gift it to you

29
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:23,726
on your wedding day.

30
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,482
Gift it to me?

31
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:33,361
Since Master Lee adored Sapsali,

32
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,615
I will also gift you a puppy.

33
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:43,079
Are you telling me to wed Master Lee?

34
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:48,293
You said just looking at him
made you happy.

35
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:54,257
Did you think
Master Lee was the one I had feelings for?

36
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:59,095
I am not that dense, you know?

37
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:01,431
So that is why you so thoughtfully offered

38
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,893
to give me a house
as a wedding gift if I marry him?

39
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:09,939
I can give you that much.

40
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,066
Better yet,

41
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,945
you should get me a house
with 100 rooms. You are well-off.

42
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:17,697
A hundred rooms?

43
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:22,160
Did you actually prefer a big house?

44
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,706
You see, I am a bit slow.

45
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:29,000
Are you a fool?

46
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:32,003
You are the one I have feelings for.

47
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:44,933
I was hoping

48
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:48,144
you would catch on to it sooner or later.

49
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:52,607
While cooking your favorite dishes
and making your clothes,

50
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:57,195
even though you are slow, I thought you
would one day catch on to my feelings.

51
00:03:58,488 --> 00:03:59,656
That was my hope.

52
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:03,993
But you want me to wed
some other man instead?

53
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,788
You will buy me a house
when I wed someone else?

54
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,290
Maidservant Kim.

55
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,628
I must have misunderstood you.

56
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:14,712
Shut up!

57
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,425
While house touring together,

58
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:23,304
I dreamed of the day
when we would wed as well.

59
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,225
I imagined us lovingly dyeing
each other's fingernails

60
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:29,686
with the balsam flowers

61
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:32,146
that we picked from our garden.

62
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,651
Lovingly?

63
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:39,654
Yes! Lovingly!

64
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:40,737
Being lovey-dovey!

65
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,784
Lovingly!

66
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:47,328
Right! Lovingly!

67
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:52,500
That image looks so vivid to me as well.

68
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:53,668
Forget it.

69
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:55,253
You have broken my dream.

70
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:58,047
I will no longer expect anything from you.

71
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:02,135
Right. I will accept a house
with 100 rooms on my wedding day.

72
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:04,804
I…

73
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:07,807
Maidservant Kim!

74
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,853
Maidservant Kim.

75
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:15,648
Lovingly.

76
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:20,069
I have ruined everything.

77
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,614
You fool.

78
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,494
Fine.

79
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:31,539
I will wed someone like you told me to.

80
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:33,791
You had better get me
that house with 100 rooms.

81
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,961
You were here.

82
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,423
Maidservant Kim, are you crying?

83
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:43,426
Of course not. Why would I?

84
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,472
You are crying. Who made you cry?

85
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:50,183
Seeing you cry breaks my heart.

86
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:52,810
I am just jealous

87
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:56,981
that Young Master Park
is getting married before you do.

88
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:59,817
I am just jealous and upset.

89
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,945
There is no need to feel that way.
I will get married soon too.

90
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,529
What?

91
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:08,701
Have you finally decided to marry someone?

92
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:12,747
Yes, so there is nothing to be sad about.

93
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,956
Then…

94
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,417
Then I should just keep these here.

95
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,045
What is all this?

96
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:22,256
They are wedding gifts
I had been keeping for your wedding.

97
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,259
But I was going to give them
to the newlyweds.

98
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,553
Why give them all of this? What a waste.

99
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:28,638
Right?

100
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,140
I should give them
to Young Lady Heo, right?

101
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,310
Why would you do that?

102
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,270
You said you are getting married.

103
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,939
I already know.

104
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:40,024
She is your bird egg.

105
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:44,654
- Bird egg?
- Your secret love.

106
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:49,742
A sophisticated egret
that will hatch in a tall tree.

107
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:55,331
You have it all wrong.
That is the wrong bird.

108
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:57,959
- Is it not her?
- No.

109
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:02,088
I thought she must be
the one who would hatch.

110
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,299
Then is there someone else?

111
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,594
Yes, there is.

112
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,097
Who is it?

113
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:15,435
Maidservant Kim, do not be startled.

114
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:16,936
If you are too shocked,

115
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,604
just bite down on your handkerchief.

116
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,733
But who could it be?

117
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:25,111
There has been no woman around you.

118
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,329
It cannot possibly be…

119
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:39,083
That is right.
This will all be for Mu-deok.

120
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:46,966
That cannot be.

121
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:50,636
That cannot be!
What happened to Young Lady Heo?

122
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,018
I guess things worked out
for you and Young Master Jang.

123
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:58,019
Yes.

124
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:00,396
I have decided to get married to him.

125
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,815
You know I am fond of spreading rumors.

126
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,985
Please do so. Let everyone know
that I have changed my fate.

127
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,948
Word of your marriage will clear up
all of his unsavory rumors.

128
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:12,783
"Unsavory rumors"?

129
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,870
Rumor had it that he was impotent

130
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:17,288
since he practiced chastity.

131
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,207
That is not true!

132
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,709
That was what everyone said.
Is it not true?

133
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,337
That is definitely not the case. Jeez.

134
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:26,964
You have confirmed it for yourself.

135
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,176
What do you mean?

136
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:33,012
I get it now.
That is why you have chosen to wed him.

137
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:35,348
What woman would marry an impotent man

138
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:37,308
even if he was from the Jang family?

139
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:38,726
Do not worry.

140
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,686
You can rest assured
that I will tell others.

141
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,688
"She checked, and he is not impotent."

142
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,398
We have not slept together yet.

143
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,318
We seriously have not!

144
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,613
Do not be embarrassed.
I am older than you.

145
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:56,702
You were just full of malice
when we first met.

146
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,538
But you seem to have a heart now.

147
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:05,545
I always thought that you could cut ties
with everyone and disappear.

148
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:10,591
I told you. I changed my fate.

149
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:15,346
I will stay here
and protect those whom I love.

150
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,099
You must like him a lot.

151
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:24,689
I hope you have a happy married life.

152
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:36,242
I will find the sword
that can help you destroy Jang Uk.

153
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:41,831
I am the only one who can protect you
by getting rid of the King's Star.

154
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,000
Jang Uk has lost all his energy.

155
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,837
He gave it all up to break the barrier.

156
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:52,258
He is no longer eligible
to be the next Gwanju.

157
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:54,218
He has lost all power.

158
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:58,806
And everyone already thinks
the King's Star has risen for me.

159
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:04,729
There is nothing more
that you can do for me, Assistant Gwanju.

160
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,900
Jang Gang sacrificed himself to keep

161
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,028
Songrim, Jinyowon, and Cheonbugwan safe.

162
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:15,823
But since Jin U-tak is alive,
you will be found guilty.

163
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,368
I do not want to punish my former master.

164
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:23,289
Come clean and accept your punishment.

165
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,879
Do you truly think the ice stone is gone?

166
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:34,300
That stone gets its power from the sky.

167
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:36,844
The one who was born
with the energy of the King's Star

168
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,639
is awarded that power.

169
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,725
What would you do

170
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:46,395
if he was actually hiding his power?

171
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,905
I will wait for your reply.

172
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,659
My loyalty will forever lie with you,
Your Royal Highness.

173
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:23,849
Why have you not said anything
after regaining consciousness?

174
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:31,065
I have only saved you
so you may atone for your sins

175
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:33,818
in front of our daughter,

176
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,695
Bu-yeon.

177
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:43,077
When we first met,

178
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,581
I fell for your warm smile.

179
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:52,169
This looks pretty too.

180
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:56,173
I think Bu-yeon
will look good in this too.

181
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:02,221
Ever since the moment
I had fallen for you,

182
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:04,557
I have

183
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,977
never loved

184
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,438
anyone else.

185
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,864
I am not trying to clear up
any misunderstanding.

186
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:24,243
I am saying this so you will suffer.

187
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,999
I want you to know

188
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:34,211
exactly what you did to our daughter
after being deceived by Jin Mu.

189
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:37,631
And I hope you will be in agony.

190
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,115
Jin U-tak is in Sejukwon.

191
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,825
He has regained consciousness.

192
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,453
If he is alive,

193
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:10,414
he will definitely expose me
and our organization.

194
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,124
We must get rid of him.

195
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:21,175
I have brought the Queen's soul potions

196
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:24,220
and the divination bells as you commanded.

197
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:27,116
I can make all the soul shifters
I have created go on a rampage with this.

198
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,495
If Jang Uk really has
the ice stone's power,

199
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,790
he will have no choice but to reveal it.

200
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,632
Please craft two rings with these.

201
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,178
Seeing how
you are ordering matching rings,

202
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,264
I guess the rumors are true.

203
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:54,101
They are wedding rings,
so please make them well.

204
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:55,102
Of course.

205
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:57,563
I will do my utmost best.

206
00:14:57,646 --> 00:15:00,608
Please take a look at these designs.

207
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:01,942
Which one do you like?

208
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,694
I like this one.

209
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:04,777
No!

210
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,448
That one is…

211
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:10,534
That was Young Lady Yeong-ok's ring.

212
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,578
- Not that one.
- All right.

213
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:14,038
It is not pretty.

214
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,249
- Then what about this one?
- No...

215
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,459
Well…

216
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,027
- Young Lady So-jeong…
- Never mind.

217
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:23,130
All of these are not my style.

218
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:25,925
I will take out the ones
that do not suit your taste.

219
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:29,303
These…

220
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,597
And these too…

221
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,891
All right.

222
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:36,477
Feel free to choose
from the remaining ones.

223
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:40,064
Seven rings?

224
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,371
Wait.

225
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:59,166
I do not think there were seven.
I really do not remember any of them.

226
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:01,168
Were all of them like Cho-yeon?

227
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:04,189
Did you promise to wed them
if they opened your gate of energy?

228
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,006
I swear. I never seduced them first.

229
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:09,677
You once said that you needed to make
an effort not to like a handsome man.

230
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,221
They all lacked in that aspect.

231
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,931
How annoying.

232
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:16,266
In any case, I am now all yours.

233
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,851
Are you not proud

234
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,853
that you beat
all the others to win my heart?

235
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,692
I would have been prouder
had there been a dozen.

236
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,360
What a shame, right?

237
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:28,028
Do you think there were not a dozen?

238
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,032
I am just kidding. You are the only one.

239
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,492
I have forgotten them all.

240
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:34,785
Hold on.

241
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,830
I did see a few rings
while cleaning your room.

242
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,623
I must look for them.

243
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,960
Why would you look
for those meaningless rings?

244
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,587
No, I am pretty sure
there were around a dozen of them.

245
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:47,672
Let go. I need to check.

246
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,139
There are none.

247
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,893
Mu-deok, shall we go eat?

248
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,231
Be honest.

249
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:05,399
How many rings?

250
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,239
Just one.

251
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:15,034
I will hold your hand as if it is a ring.

252
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:18,412
This is a one-of-a-kind ring.

253
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,165
Well…

254
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,126
Since we already have rings,

255
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:27,129
we will not need to make any
with the yin-and-yang jade.

256
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:32,009
Should we make necklaces
with this instead?

257
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,635
Do as you please.

258
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,388
I am not jealous of Dang-gu one bit.

259
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:40,184
- I am not jealous of Cho-yeon either.
- I guess the rumors are true.

260
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,853
That impertinent young master is smiling.

261
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,397
You are right.

262
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,649
I guess I had misunderstood

263
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:52,279
everything from the beginning.
How embarrassing.

264
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:54,573
Young Lady Heo.

265
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:59,078
Do not tell me you confessed your love
to him when you were trapped together.

266
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:02,456
I was going to. And I almost did.

267
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,250
I had my chance.

268
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,804
You do not need to hold that up for me.

269
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,680
You can place it down.

270
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:23,060
Are you uncomfortable that I am here?

271
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,603
I am fine.

272
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,815
You can do as you please.

273
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:34,279
When you were drunk
and lying down in Sejukwon,

274
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:37,491
you were comfortable with me
taking care of you all night.

275
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:39,451
Because I thought you were Mu-deok.

276
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:53,173
So that is how he looks
when he is around someone he likes.

277
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:57,553
If Young Master Jang got hurt
instead of Young Master Seo,

278
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,180
you two would have gotten closer.

279
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,976
Because you treat those who are hurt.

280
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:06,687
Do you think so?

281
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,731
Had he gotten injured,

282
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,319
would I have had a chance?

283
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:24,037
Yul, I heard you were returning
to Seoho Fortress.

284
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,415
Yes, after attending Dang-gu's wedding.

285
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,138
Let us have a farewell party before then.

286
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,251
Sure.

287
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:44,933
Despite that your wound has healed,
you are still experiencing pain?

288
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:49,104
I thought it would get better,
but I was wrong.

289
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,065
Did something else happen
while I was unconscious

290
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,692
in the barrier?

291
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:57,905
We just stopped the bleeding
from your wound.

292
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:03,660
So-i, who ran away, gave you her blood.

293
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,832
You cannot give blood this way.

294
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,501
Why were you so reckless?

295
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:14,379
I just wanted

296
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,257
to save him.

297
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:23,805
Her blood did enter your wound.

298
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,892
But that should not be a problem.

299
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,393
I am sure I will recover soon.

300
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:32,064
I do not want the elders to worry,
so please keep it a secret.

301
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:36,818
All right. Drink up.

302
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:40,614
Hey, what are you doing there?

303
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:43,909
What did you steal from...

304
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,578
What is this?

305
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,538
Hey! Stop there!

306
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,812
The wound where the worm left
is not healing quickly.

307
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,076
There is a blood parasite in his body.

308
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,957
He must be in pain.

309
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:36,295
He should take the medicine I took
in Jinyowon to relieve the pain.

310
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:43,677
Mu-deok.

311
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:49,891
You should stop working here.

312
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:53,562
What is it? Are you kicking me out?

313
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,689
If I was, would you listen?

314
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:58,358
- No.
- I knew you would not.

315
00:21:58,442 --> 00:21:59,943
Do not turn me into a bad person.

316
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,531
Do not do household chores anymore.

317
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:09,036
You will be his precious wife,
so I cannot make you work.

318
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:13,248
Does that mean you will accept me?

319
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:16,126
What choice do I have?
He absolutely adores you.

320
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:21,548
Also, I will not address you as "my lady."

321
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:22,507
Goodness.

322
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,444
I will not consider you
my mother-in-law either.

323
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:27,304
Why would I be your mother-in-law
when I am still single?

324
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:28,388
That would hurt my pride.

325
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,140
That is true.

326
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:33,518
But you and the leader
will get married soon, right?

327
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,939
I thought you liked each other.

328
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:45,655
Unbelievable.

329
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:47,991
Maidservant Kim.

330
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,369
Even you can tell that, but he cannot.

331
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,705
- Gosh.
- Hold on.

332
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:56,333
How could he possibly be that slow?

333
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:57,542
Is he a fool?

334
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,002
He sure is.

335
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,172
Goodness.

336
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:08,220
Yes! Lovingly! Being lovey-dovey!

337
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,806
I just cannot

338
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,142
forget those words

339
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,519
that she has said

340
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,230
to me.

341
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,117
My lord.

342
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:36,248
Uk.

343
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:39,459
When did you get here?

344
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,878
I was here for a while.
I had something to tell you.

345
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:45,090
What are you thinking about so intensely?

346
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:47,384
Something terrible

347
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,053
has been bothering me.

348
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,098
What do you need to tell me?

349
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:54,933
You see…

350
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:59,187
I am planning to leave the capital
for some time after Dang-gu's wedding.

351
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:01,398
I see.

352
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:04,609
Then…

353
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,362
What about Maidservant Kim?

354
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:09,447
Goodness.

355
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:13,535
If no one wants her to stay here,
then I will have to bring her with me.

356
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:18,248
We do not know when we will return.
It could be one year or ten years.

357
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:20,917
Or we may just never return.

358
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:28,300
I have done something

359
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,636
unforgivable to her.

360
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:33,471
Oh, dear.

361
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,433
If I hold on to her,

362
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:39,769
do you think she will stay?

363
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:42,229
She…

364
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:45,065
shed some tears.

365
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:56,161
She will cry even harder
if you do not stop her from leaving.

366
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:04,711
I will leave

367
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:07,297
with Young Master Jang.

368
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:10,008
I will not.

369
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:13,303
I will.

370
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,894
There is no point in staying. I should go.

371
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,578
There is something I would like

372
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,249
to show you.

373
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,220
They are balsam seeds.

374
00:25:56,554 --> 00:25:58,181
If you plant these right now,

375
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:02,143
the flowers will bloom
in three to four months.

376
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:08,066
I could make them bloom
in front of your eyes right now

377
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:10,068
by using a spell.

378
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,404
But…

379
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:15,865
I tend to be slow.

380
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:24,124
I would like to wait
and watch them sprout, grow,

381
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,502
and bloom.

382
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,385
Can you wait with me?

383
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:09,836
Of course.

384
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:16,718
I will walk

385
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:21,264
at your pace.

386
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:42,702
This gift will only interrupt them.

387
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:05,934
Thank you. We will enjoy the fish.

388
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,102
Thank you.

389
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:19,989
Did you see that?

390
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:22,700
That man was crying.

391
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:27,122
I have never seen an adult cry
with a runny nose before.

392
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:30,583
He must be ill.

393
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:31,835
Do you think so?

394
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,530
Are you all right?

395
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:03,366
I have brought you some medicine.

396
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,784
Here.

397
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,336
Once Shaman Choi's brother
who is in Sejukwon starts talking,

398
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,213
we will be able to catch Jin Mu soon.

399
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:20,300
There is something I must ask Jin Mu.

400
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:24,804
Whether my father chose
to become a soul shifter

401
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:27,766
or if there was a story behind it.

402
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,309
Only he will know.

403
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:35,023
Lord Cho Chung passed away
because of Gwanju Jang Gang.

404
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:39,486
Lord Cho found out
that the Gwanju had practiced sorcery.

405
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:41,279
Afraid that Lord Cho would tell the truth,

406
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:44,574
Jin Mu turned him into a soul shifter
and made him run wild.

407
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:46,284
Are you saying

408
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:48,995
we killed him
when he was actually innocent?

409
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,753
It is not our fault.

410
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:59,214
We were not aware of that situation.

411
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,382
Everyone thinks

412
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:04,761
that Lord Cho killed his own family
after practicing sorcery.

413
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:09,265
The Gwanju implored
that Lord Cho's name is cleared.

414
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:13,853
We should discuss this
at the next Unanimous Assembly.

415
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:17,106
But why did Jin Mu go that far?

416
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,359
If he just wanted to silence Lord Cho,

417
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:20,902
why did he turn him

418
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:24,697
into a soul shifter
and make him kill his entire family?

419
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,159
Jin Mu knows everything

420
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:32,288
about the circumstances of Uk's birth.

421
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,041
He only did that

422
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:37,043
to Jang Gang's friend, Cho Chung,

423
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:40,505
solely to torture Jang Gang.

424
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:41,798
That means

425
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:46,553
if Jin Mu gets caught, he will expose

426
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:49,138
Young Master Jang's secret.

427
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:52,851
We cannot let that happen. Jin Mu…

428
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:56,646
must be killed.

429
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:14,497
If you cast a divination curse
on the Soul Ejector,

430
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:18,626
you can control the soul that uses it.

431
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:33,016
You can make him run wild

432
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:38,229
and then get rid of him by petrification.

433
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:49,157
Shaman Choi

434
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:54,329
cast divination curses
on all Soul Ejectors she had made.

435
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:59,167
That is why I have never
shifted souls to this day.

436
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:02,670
I will make all soul shifters

437
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:06,507
in this capital run wild
just like Cho Chung did that day.

438
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:13,221
Assistant Gwanju.

439
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:16,392
Jang Uk is going to leave Jeongjingak.

440
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:20,146
Songrim is letting him go?

441
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:21,229
That is what I heard.

442
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:23,441
Rumor has it
that he is leaving the capital as well.

443
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:25,860
He will leave everything behind?

444
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:29,197
Jang Uk is the only way I can hold on to
the Crown Prince. If he disappears…

445
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,324
There is nothing more
that you can do for me,

446
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,450
Assistant Gwanju.

447
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:36,704
Why in the world is he leaving Songrim?

448
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:40,166
He even consumed poison to get in there
and even reached Chisu.

449
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:43,211
He may even have the ice stone's power,

450
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,754
so why?

451
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:52,136
Maybe he had a change of heart.

452
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:59,602
That means he has changed.

453
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:01,980
Why do you think
he changed all of a sudden?

454
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,900
What made him change?

455
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:10,029
People change because of other people.

456
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:14,200
Find out who showed up
just when he began to change.

457
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:18,621
That will be your answer.

458
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:22,625
The person who showed up
just when he began to change…

459
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:24,961
I am here for Naksu's sword.

460
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:31,217
That is ridiculous.
It could not have been Naksu.

461
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:34,929
He used Tansu, which was Naksu's skill.

462
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:36,639
No.

463
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,934
He must have learned that from Master Lee.

464
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:43,062
I saw everything
during my time in Danhyanggok with him.

465
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:46,774
And by his side was
no one other than his maid.

466
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:59,746
Is he leaving with his maid?

467
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:00,830
Yes.

468
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:04,834
I heard he is leaving with Mu-deok,
the maid who always follows him around.

469
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,977
I feel bad about bringing you here.

470
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,897
You said you had a lot to buy.

471
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,565
I should help you carry them.

472
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:35,573
If she is who I think she is…

473
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:25,748
Mu-deok.

474
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:39,011
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

475
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:41,597
Did you not hear me calling you?

476
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:44,976
I did.

477
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:48,354
Why did I not answer?

478
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,774
Did you also hear bells?

479
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,986
Bells? No, I did not.

480
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:58,865
- This is not of good quality. Let us go.
- Sure.

481
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:03,201
Naksu.

482
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:07,665
You have given me hope.

483
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:18,467
Master Lee, there is one over there.

484
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,928
Gosh.

485
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:22,471
Come on.

486
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:25,766
Master Lee, you have been
letting them go countless times.

487
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:28,704
I do not have regrets
about the fish I have failed to catch.

488
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,396
What do you mean?

489
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:33,191
It would be a waste. It would be unfair.

490
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,985
That is being greedy and obsessive.

491
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:38,362
- What?
- However,

492
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:42,825
I saw there is pure sadness in loss.

493
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:50,124
Lately, I am starting
to understand why people feel sad

494
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,918
when they see a river running,

495
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:56,130
a season passing, and a sun setting.

496
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,601
Looking at this empty basket makes me sad.

497
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:10,770
Mu-deok told me to catch a lot of fish.

498
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,731
Do you plan to keep
the soul shifter by your side?

499
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,154
We kept our promise to you.

500
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,740
I stood in front of Naksu's sword,

501
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,784
and she put down her sword.

502
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:30,164
So I hope you will keep your end
of the bargain and let us go.

503
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,416
What happened to the ice stone that day?

504
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:37,046
Is it perhaps inside you?

505
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,813
Even if it is,

506
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:56,899
it is completely useless.

507
00:37:56,983 --> 00:38:01,362
I can no longer catch a waterdrop,
let alone a Golden Fish.

508
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:08,035
If you train again,
you will be able to use that power.

509
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,663
I witnessed
how the desire to win that power

510
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:14,000
made people violent and evil.

511
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:18,087
It is only right
not to awaken the ice stone's power.

512
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:23,217
You are greedy with catching fish

513
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,303
but not with the ice stone?

514
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:28,222
You are better than me.

515
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:34,937
In any case, since I have the ice stone,

516
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:38,232
I can protect one individual.

517
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:42,570
If Mu-deok runs wild,

518
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:46,115
please help me use this power to stop it.

519
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:50,703
She will be fine as long as
she does not try to bring out her power.

520
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:54,915
That small, weak body is housing
the powerful soul of an assassin.

521
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,710
If anything, she would have
already run wild.

522
00:38:57,793 --> 00:38:59,587
The reason why she has not

523
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:03,049
is that her body is
in control of the soul's power.

524
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:07,261
I could see that on the day we first met.

525
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:15,186
The only thing that can
encompass the powers of a mage

526
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:17,396
is the divine powers of priestesses.

527
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:22,318
I believe Mu-deok's body
originally belonged

528
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:25,363
to someone with great divine powers.

529
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:51,347
This will help relieve the pain.

530
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:56,143
It will only relieve the pain
but not get rid of it.

531
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:59,480
I need to give this to him.

532
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:09,615
So you have dug your own grave.

533
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:14,578
How dare you deceive me
by pretending to be my daughter,

534
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,246
So-i?

535
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,668
You were not fooled.

536
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:23,504
You knew but feigned ignorance.

537
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:26,757
Was it because of the ice stone?

538
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:29,677
That is right.

539
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,888
A mother can always recognize her child.

540
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:36,100
Before you run your mouth further,

541
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:40,354
it would be best
if I killed you here right now.

542
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:43,232
Can you also

543
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:46,068
recognize this?

544
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:49,071
Bu-yeon was wearing this
on the day she disappeared.

545
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:52,491
You said you embroidered it yourself.

546
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,589
Where did you get this?

547
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:08,883
Did Jin Mu give it to you?

548
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:12,218
No.

549
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:16,807
Only I know who its real owner is.

550
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,100
Tell me.

551
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:21,437
Your daughter is still alive.

552
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:24,440
Kill me,

553
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:26,942
and you will never see her again.

554
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:30,654
I will spare you.

555
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:33,073
Where is my daughter?

556
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:38,537
Do not rush me.

557
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:44,293
I will tell you
once I know that I am safe.

558
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:02,978
The ice stone has disappeared.

559
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:06,148
But there are still soul shifters
that the Choi siblings

560
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:08,400
and their gang have created.

561
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:12,780
Songrim and Jinyowon
will eliminate all of them.

562
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:16,617
I ask that you will help us as well.

563
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:22,039
You are implying that

564
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:25,084
I should not protect Jin Mu
even if he gets caught.

565
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:29,755
I know he was your master
but I believe you are not blinded by him.

566
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,551
So you trust me?

567
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:36,053
Then do you also believe

568
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:39,974
that I am the King's Star
who got rid of the ice stone?

569
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:48,399
The ice stone's barrier was lifted,
and you were there.

570
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:50,276
That was when the King's Star appeared.

571
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:55,072
So like everyone else,
I believe the King's Star was for you.

572
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:02,705
I was not the only one here that day.

573
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:05,291
Who would have minded them

574
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:09,211
when you were in their presence?

575
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:13,507
It was Jang Uk.
I am sure you saw him as well.

576
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:17,845
He is like a son to me.

577
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:21,223
You saved his life, Your Royal Highness.

578
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:24,268
I am truly grateful for that.

579
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:37,740
I will quit my job here in Songrim today.

580
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:39,074
I came to resign.

581
00:43:41,368 --> 00:43:43,912
You really jumped through hoops
to land this job.

582
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:46,999
It is a shame that
you are quitting due to marriage.

583
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:51,295
Then again, you are trading it off
for becoming the lady of the Jang family.

584
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:56,091
Mu-deok, congratulations on your marriage.

585
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:57,259
Be happy.

586
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:06,644
Come on, now. Come.

587
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:11,023
Why are you standing there? Follow me.

588
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:19,490
Your Royal Highness,
thank you for saving my life.

589
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,619
I hope the King's Star will shine forever.

590
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:25,913
That is enough.
You do not need to pretend as well.

591
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:27,497
It is uncomfortable.

592
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:33,379
You already know that it was Jang Uk
who saved everyone that day.

593
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:37,675
Like you two have promised,
I will not tell a soul.

594
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:38,926
So do not worry.

595
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:44,181
Do I look worried that I will lose credit?

596
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:46,892
I am just annoyed by everyone's flattery.

597
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:49,728
They are all praising you.

598
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:53,065
You can just accept it for what it is.

599
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:55,943
It offends me to hear
such things from strangers.

600
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:58,862
Seeing you worship me
despite knowing everything…

601
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:03,242
feels like you are mocking me,
and I hate it.

602
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:10,541
I can empathize with you.

603
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:15,504
You will never see me again.

604
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:17,089
So do not worry.

605
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:20,217
I heard.

606
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:24,096
- You are leaving with him.
- Yes, Your Royal Highness.

607
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:27,516
We are going to go far away
from this capital and live together.

608
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,143
Together?

609
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:34,064
I could easily stop you from leaving.

610
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:36,859
Do you think I will let him go

611
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:39,319
when he knows my weakness?

612
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:46,952
Then how would it feel
to keep having him around you?

613
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:53,000
Then it would not
simply just offend you anymore.

614
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:00,340
Right.

615
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:03,760
You are Filthy Mu-deok
who listens to my petty complaints.

616
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:06,805
Then listen to this as well.

617
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:10,767
I will feel small, knowing that he did
something I had failed to do.

618
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:14,813
And pretending to have done something
I did not do will make me more pathetic.

619
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:15,939
But most of all,

620
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:19,902
I will vehemently despise…

621
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:24,740
seeing you two together.

622
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:29,578
I had told you before

623
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:33,123
that I do not hold on to things
that I know I cannot hold on to.

624
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:35,959
Do you know what happens
if I try and still fail to hold on?

625
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:39,922
Will you blame that individual

626
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:42,925
and get rid of them?

627
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:46,845
If this pathetic, wretched feeling
turns into a violent, wicked one,

628
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,684
simply avoiding me will not cut it.

629
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:57,439
Go far away…

630
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:00,526
where I cannot reach you.

631
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:15,958
Everyone.

632
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:18,502
I am getting married tomorrow!

633
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:26,093
You little boys.

634
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:29,805
We will not see each other
that often anymore.

635
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:30,806
Of course not.

636
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:33,934
Cho-yeon would not allow that.

637
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:35,811
- Neither will his mother-in-law.
- Right.

638
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:38,564
He will no longer come

639
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:40,899
to our polo matches.

640
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:43,026
Nor when we go fishing.

641
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:47,114
I can still make time
and see you every now and then.

642
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:49,866
What will you say?
Will you lie that you are training?

643
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:52,744
Are you seriously going to lie
to a Jinyowon priestess?

644
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:54,538
He will get caught right away.

645
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:57,124
She will surround you with her relics

646
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:58,667
and demand the truth.

647
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,502
Then you will be bewitched and come clean.

648
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:03,797
They will pluck all of his hair.

649
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,008
Oh, dear. He has thin hair to begin with.

650
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:12,638
I get it.

651
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:13,849
You are just envious of me.

652
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:16,935
I am still happy.

653
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:19,771
Because my first love came true.

654
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:24,818
I will give you bachelors my good energy.

655
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:30,324
- I caught it.
- Right, you have Mu-deok.

656
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:32,451
- That is right.
- But she is not your first love.

657
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:35,245
- Is she your eighth love?
- No.

658
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:37,706
- You better not say that to her.
- Fine.

659
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:39,666
All right. Forget it then.

660
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,252
Yul, you can take my energy.

661
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:43,378
That is fine.

662
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:45,631
I was rejected recently.

663
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:46,882
What?

664
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:48,216
By whom?

665
00:48:49,676 --> 00:48:50,886
Was it Mu-deok?

666
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,016
No.

667
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:59,519
The person I had feelings for was not her.

668
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:05,776
Then who could it have been?

669
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:08,236
Uk, do you know?

670
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:10,781
Well, I do have my guesses.

671
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:19,206
Have you decided on your destination, Uk?

672
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:23,418
Sari Village. I am curious
about something there as well.

673
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:26,922
Are you all prepared to go
back to Seoho Fortress?

674
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:29,675
You are leaving
right after my wedding, right?

675
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:31,218
I think I will have to go later.

676
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:33,595
I need more treatment.

677
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:35,305
Does it still hurt?

678
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:37,224
I heard the wound had already healed up.

679
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,726
What is this? Is Master Heo a quack?

680
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,104
The wound has healed,

681
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:43,647
but I still feel some pain.

682
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:46,190
I will be fine.

683
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:01,915
Young Master Seo.

684
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:05,502
I do not know
if I should give this to you.

685
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:08,922
But a beggar asked me to give this to you.

686
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:25,230
This medicine
will relieve your chest pain.

687
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:26,982
You must take it.

688
00:50:28,316 --> 00:50:30,444
This person knows my condition.

689
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:32,279
Who could it be?

690
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:46,168
I knew you would come back,
Your Royal Highness.

691
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:51,214
There is nothing Jang Uk can do,
so I will cast him far away.

692
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:53,425
As for the ice stone, he does not have it.

693
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:56,928
Own up to your crimes
by the end of the day.

694
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:58,263
If you do not,

695
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:02,976
I will have no choice
but to capture you myself.

696
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:08,106
You are being deceived by everyone.

697
00:51:11,067 --> 00:51:13,445
Did you meet with Songrim's leader today?

698
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:15,655
What did he say?

699
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:18,867
Did he praise you
for being the King's Star?

700
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:23,413
He is aware that it was Jang Uk, not you.

701
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:28,043
And so does Master Lee.

702
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:30,045
Despite that, he barged into the palace

703
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:32,380
and mentioned the King's Star.

704
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:38,970
Are you saying that they had
all deceived and mocked me?

705
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:41,473
They are trying to protect Jang Uk.

706
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:43,892
The real King's Star has the ice stone,

707
00:51:43,975 --> 00:51:45,352
and Songrim is protecting him.

708
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:48,480
I am the only one who can protect you,
Your Royal Highness.

709
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:55,862
He is hiding a great secret.

710
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:57,989
I will expose him…

711
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:00,617
and…

712
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:05,288
make him hit rock bottom.

713
00:52:15,006 --> 00:52:16,091
Darn it.

714
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:19,511
What? Who drank it all?

715
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:20,804
Your cup is empty.

716
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:22,973
It was you, right? You drank it all.

717
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:25,183
If it is empty, pour me some.

718
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:26,685
- There we go.
- Have some.

719
00:52:26,768 --> 00:52:29,312
"Have some"? How dare you.

720
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:30,772
- "Have some"?
- Drink up…

721
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:34,317
Goodness, it is our young master!

722
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:38,905
Young Master,
we were having a drink to celebrate

723
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:41,616
- her resignation from Songrim.
- I see.

724
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:44,202
- Hi, Jang Uk.
- Hey!

725
00:52:44,786 --> 00:52:46,580
He is our young master.

726
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:50,041
I am sorry. My mistake.

727
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:52,252
- That is right.
- They had one too many as well.

728
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:53,336
Young Master.

729
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,547
Come here.

730
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:02,053
Let me show you something
really fascinating.

731
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:03,597
When Mu-deok is drunk,

732
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:06,766
she does not speak in dialect.

733
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:10,020
Is that fascinating?

734
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:11,688
It is a pity

735
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:14,357
that I cannot show you.

736
00:53:15,066 --> 00:53:17,986
But I can fly up to the roof.

737
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:20,322
Really? Try it.

738
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:22,240
- Try it?
- Try it.

739
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:24,575
Watch closely.

740
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:33,835
Darn it. Hold on.

741
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:38,048
- Mu-deok.
- It is not working.

742
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:39,131
Sit back down.

743
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:41,593
I cannot do it anymore. I…

744
00:53:42,844 --> 00:53:44,763
I cannot draw that sword either.

745
00:53:44,846 --> 00:53:46,514
What? That?

746
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:49,184
That is not yours. That was Naksu's.

747
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:51,353
- Young Master.
- Yes?

748
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:55,690
Why do you keep bringing
that dreadful thing in here?

749
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:57,609
I will get rid of it.

750
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:00,278
Let me try it again.

751
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:01,613
- Sure. Try it.
- Sit down.

752
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:03,657
Fly. Do it.

753
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:10,246
- Wrap up and go to bed.
- Did you see that?

754
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:12,082
- I will get rid of Mu-deok.
- I can fly.

755
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:14,084
- Stop moving.
- It worked.

756
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:16,044
She really did fly.

757
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:19,172
Leader, did you see that?

758
00:54:19,255 --> 00:54:21,007
I want to fly too.

759
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:24,052
You kids have no idea who I am.

760
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:27,180
I am the true master. Want me to show you?

761
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:31,893
I am the master.

762
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,229
Today is just not my day.

763
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:42,404
Mu-deok.

764
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:45,615
Do not drink ever again.
You will tell everyone that you are Naksu.

765
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:50,203
I have something to tell you.

766
00:54:50,286 --> 00:54:51,955
Sleep now. Tell me tomorrow.

767
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:55,000
I must say it today.

768
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:58,378
What if I do nothing and die tomorrow?

769
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:01,423
Fine, tell me. Since you say you may die.

770
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:02,590
I am all ears.

771
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:08,471
Jang Uk.

772
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:13,101
I like you a lot.

773
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:33,788
I see. And she went to bed.

774
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:35,248
Just like that.

775
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:41,755
I need to tell her what Master Lee said.

776
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:46,551
I believe Mu-deok's body
originally belonged

777
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:49,387
to someone with great divine powers.

778
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:53,099
Maybe I will find out
once I go to Sari Village.

779
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:39,038
Let bygones be bygones.

780
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:41,332
You will now become in-laws.

781
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:45,211
Cho-yeon is not marrying
into the Park family.

782
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:48,631
Dang-gu is the one marrying into ours.

783
00:57:49,507 --> 00:57:51,050
He is not moving in with your family.

784
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:54,762
Since you keep saying such things,
people are talking

785
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:57,432
about how his surname will change to Jin.

786
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:01,102
Their daughter will be given our surname.

787
00:58:01,769 --> 00:58:03,104
Their son will be given ours.

788
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:06,858
Do not argue on this wonderful day.

789
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:08,860
The guests will arrive soon.

790
00:58:08,943 --> 00:58:11,779
You should get ready to greet them.

791
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:13,573
Go on.

792
00:58:16,784 --> 00:58:18,036
Where is Dang-gu?

793
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:20,163
He will go
to Sejukwon with Cho-yeon first.

794
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:23,458
They are going to sneak inside
and greet her father first.

795
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:25,668
Where is Mu-deok?

796
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:29,964
I am not sure.
She came here first, but I do not see her.

797
00:58:31,549 --> 00:58:34,093
Is she embarrassed
and avoiding me because of last night?

798
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:39,741
Naksu.

799
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:43,871
You cannot draw your sword
because you are stuck in that body.

800
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:48,167
You are my last weapon.

801
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:51,254
I will use all my power
to bring out yours.

802
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:54,007
Once you regain your powers,

803
00:59:55,049 --> 00:59:56,593
you shall run wild.

804
01:00:54,108 --> 01:00:57,111
Only I know who its real owner is.

805
01:00:57,862 --> 01:01:00,239
Your daughter is still alive.

806
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:02,325
Mother.

807
01:01:13,378 --> 01:01:14,420
Maidservant Kim.

808
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:23,805
Where did your maid,
Mu-deok, used to live?

809
01:01:25,264 --> 01:01:28,101
Are her parents alive?

810
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:32,313
No, they are not.
She grew up in Sari Village.

811
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:35,942
When she was falsely accused
because of that girl, So-i,

812
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:37,568
I had told you all of this.

813
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:40,154
I had asked you to help that poor girl.

814
01:01:40,905 --> 01:01:42,365
But you ignored me.

815
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:46,494
Does So-i know Mu-deok?

816
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:50,039
Yes. Young Lady Jin also knows her.

817
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:57,922
You are blindingly beautiful.

818
01:02:00,174 --> 01:02:03,010
You are handsome as well.

819
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:09,308
Let us go greet your father.

820
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:11,644
We cannot stay there for long.

821
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:15,356
If the elders find out,
they will give us an earful.

822
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:17,024
Right.

823
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:19,068
Thank you,

824
01:02:20,653 --> 01:02:23,156
my husband.

825
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:29,746
Be careful,

826
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:32,707
my wife.

827
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:34,959
My dear wife.

828
01:02:36,335 --> 01:02:37,670
Wait for me.

829
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:46,304
Mu-deok? What are you doing here?

830
01:02:51,642 --> 01:02:54,228
Mu-deok, you cannot bring that in here.

831
01:02:57,648 --> 01:02:59,942
First, kill Jin U-tak.

832
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:06,907
Mu-deok!

833
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:39,315
What is going on?

834
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:42,944
Are you not

835
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:45,613
Jang Uk's maid?

836
01:03:46,197 --> 01:03:47,365
Are you hurt?

837
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:15,309
Kill Jin U-tak.

838
01:04:22,942 --> 01:04:24,068
Father!

839
01:04:26,237 --> 01:04:28,322
Father!

840
01:04:30,616 --> 01:04:31,701
Mu-deok.

841
01:04:31,784 --> 01:04:32,869
What are you doing?

842
01:04:32,952 --> 01:04:34,453
She is…

843
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:37,248
She is an assassin.

844
01:04:37,999 --> 01:04:39,166
Run, Cho-yeon.

845
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:40,501
Hurry!

846
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:06,694
Young Master Park!

847
01:05:06,777 --> 01:05:07,987
Stop Mu-deok.

848
01:05:11,657 --> 01:05:12,657
Mu-deok.

849
01:05:14,702 --> 01:05:16,579
Please stop her!

850
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:18,956
No…

851
01:05:47,985 --> 01:05:49,987
Kill her. Hurry!

852
01:06:07,546 --> 01:06:08,589
Father!

853
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:12,093
Father!

854
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:13,635
Father!

855
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:16,304
Father!

856
01:06:17,723 --> 01:06:19,767
Father!

857
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:22,603
Father!

858
01:06:23,229 --> 01:06:24,814
Do not die!

859
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:29,902
Father, please…

860
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:32,196
Father!

861
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:36,325
Father.

862
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:48,045
Father, please do not die.

863
01:06:49,755 --> 01:06:50,840
Naksu.

864
01:06:52,299 --> 01:06:54,719
Kill those who murdered your father.

865
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:01,308
Father!

866
01:07:02,143 --> 01:07:03,352
Father!

867
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:04,812
Father!

868
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:06,814
No!

869
01:07:36,969 --> 01:07:39,180
How dare you show your face here?

870
01:07:40,431 --> 01:07:41,974
Capture that criminal, Jin Mu!

871
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:45,102
I, Assistant Gwanju Jin Mu,

872
01:07:45,186 --> 01:07:47,063
am here to catch a soul shifter.

873
01:07:49,648 --> 01:07:52,985
Naksu, a soul shifter,
is in Songrim as we speak.

874
01:07:54,111 --> 01:07:56,155
- Naksu?
- My lord!

875
01:08:00,701 --> 01:08:02,161
We have a problem.

876
01:08:02,244 --> 01:08:04,747
An assassin has appeared in Sejukwon.

877
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:10,336
And that assassin murdered Lord Jin.

878
01:08:11,337 --> 01:08:14,215
That very assassin is Naksu
whom I have been looking for.

879
01:08:14,965 --> 01:08:15,965
That is not true.

880
01:08:16,675 --> 01:08:18,135
It was…

881
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:19,428
It was Mu-deok.

882
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:23,349
Mu-deok is Naksu.

883
01:08:30,689 --> 01:08:31,732
An assassin!

884
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:34,276
An assassin has appeared in Sejukwon!

885
01:09:06,934 --> 01:09:08,352
Get her.

886
01:09:30,374 --> 01:09:31,959
- Go get her!
- Yes, sir!

887
01:11:12,226 --> 01:11:13,227
Mu-deok.

888
01:11:17,064 --> 01:11:18,190
Mu-deok.

889
01:11:21,443 --> 01:11:22,569
Mu-deok.

890
01:11:27,157 --> 01:11:28,158
Mu-deok.

891
01:11:34,081 --> 01:11:35,081
Jang Uk?

892
01:11:49,430 --> 01:11:50,764
Did I do this?

893
01:11:52,474 --> 01:11:53,726
I did.

894
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:57,354
I stabbed you.

895
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:19,793
Just one.

896
01:12:22,254 --> 01:12:25,132
I will hold your hand as if it is a ring.

897
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:28,594
This is a one-of-a-kind ring.

898
01:12:31,805 --> 01:12:34,099
If I become Naksu, I will be in danger.

899
01:12:34,683 --> 01:12:37,978
What happens to me then
will have nothing to do with you.

900
01:12:40,689 --> 01:12:41,689
Why?

901
01:12:42,107 --> 01:12:44,318
Because we will no longer be
master and pupil?

902
01:12:44,401 --> 01:12:46,653
You will no longer
have a reason to protect me.

903
01:12:46,737 --> 01:12:49,031
Nor will I have a reason
to go easy on you.

904
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:52,409
That was our promise from the start.

905
01:12:52,951 --> 01:12:54,745
Then promise me one more thing.

906
01:12:54,828 --> 01:12:56,288
When you regain your energy

907
01:12:56,997 --> 01:12:59,500
and if you must draw
and point that sword at someone,

908
01:13:00,542 --> 01:13:02,252
point it at me before at anyone else.

909
01:13:03,504 --> 01:13:04,671
If you stab me,

910
01:13:04,755 --> 01:13:09,510
then I will die as the one
who released the assassin.

911
01:13:16,141 --> 01:13:17,267
Jang Uk!

912
01:13:21,605 --> 01:13:22,815
Jang Uk!

913
01:13:26,902 --> 01:13:28,654
No…

914
01:14:28,714 --> 01:14:29,715
Get her!

915
01:15:12,883 --> 01:15:13,926
Uk…

916
01:15:21,016 --> 01:15:22,476
Uk!

917
01:16:14,778 --> 01:16:16,071
I think…

918
01:16:19,074 --> 01:16:22,369
Uk knew that Mu-deok was Naksu.

919
01:16:24,079 --> 01:16:25,455
Jin Mu

920
01:16:26,498 --> 01:16:29,459
is raiding Jeongjingak
to find proof of that as we speak.

921
01:16:35,007 --> 01:16:36,592
I was aware of it as well.

922
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:39,595
Please allow me to go find her

923
01:16:39,678 --> 01:16:42,264
and find out what happened.

924
01:16:42,347 --> 01:16:45,350
You are the eldest son of the Seo family.

925
01:16:46,351 --> 01:16:49,104
You did not know anything.

926
01:16:50,564 --> 01:16:53,567
You are forbidden from leaving
the premises from this moment on.

927
01:17:05,579 --> 01:17:06,788
Father died

928
01:17:07,581 --> 01:17:10,250
in the hands of that assassin.

929
01:17:10,876 --> 01:17:12,169
I will find

930
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:15,380
and kill her.

931
01:17:18,258 --> 01:17:19,301
No.

932
01:17:22,679 --> 01:17:26,850
You must bring her back here alive.

933
01:17:28,602 --> 01:17:32,147
Naksu is only the soul
that is in that body.

934
01:17:32,230 --> 01:17:35,359
I must find out
to whom that body originally belonged.

935
01:17:37,861 --> 01:17:40,364
Bring her back at all costs.

936
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:53,293
Naksu was the one who performed

937
01:17:53,377 --> 01:17:55,629
the alchemy of souls
alongside the Choi siblings.

938
01:17:56,421 --> 01:17:58,483
I had caught the individual
who had previously escaped

939
01:17:58,507 --> 01:18:00,050
when I had killed all of Naksu's men.

940
01:18:00,133 --> 01:18:02,803
That was how I knew
that Naksu was still alive.

941
01:18:03,428 --> 01:18:06,014
I had been searching for her all along

942
01:18:06,098 --> 01:18:07,683
just to clear my name.

943
01:18:07,766 --> 01:18:08,934
And she was the daughter

944
01:18:09,017 --> 01:18:11,436
of Cho Chung, who was killed
by the four families?

945
01:18:12,312 --> 01:18:15,440
She must have entered Songrim
to avenge her father.

946
01:18:16,316 --> 01:18:19,111
And Jang Gang's son kept her
by his side despite knowing this?

947
01:18:19,194 --> 01:18:20,987
We will never know since he has died.

948
01:18:21,071 --> 01:18:24,658
But I hope you will punish Songrim greatly
for everything that has occurred.

949
01:18:29,204 --> 01:18:30,747
Where is Naksu?

950
01:18:30,831 --> 01:18:33,333
Cheonbugwan's men are after her.

951
01:18:33,417 --> 01:18:37,838
Since she has run wild,
she will soon petrify and meet her demise.

952
01:18:55,105 --> 01:18:56,148
Mu-deok.

953
01:19:00,485 --> 01:19:01,862
Mu-deok.

954
01:19:05,907 --> 01:19:07,033
Jang Uk!

955
01:19:27,137 --> 01:19:31,099
I am not allowed to wear mourning clothes

956
01:19:31,683 --> 01:19:33,894
nor give him a proper funeral
as if he was a criminal.

957
01:19:34,644 --> 01:19:37,731
How could they burn his body
in such a place?

958
01:19:40,192 --> 01:19:41,943
This cannot happen!

959
01:19:42,527 --> 01:19:44,237
Please stop them…

960
01:19:46,114 --> 01:19:47,449
Songrim…

961
01:19:49,034 --> 01:19:50,285
has no say

962
01:19:51,703 --> 01:19:53,330
in this matter.

963
01:19:55,332 --> 01:19:56,500
I am sorry.

964
01:20:16,978 --> 01:20:18,188
Young Master Jang…

965
01:21:19,624 --> 01:21:21,960
Why am I here?

966
01:21:26,464 --> 01:21:27,549
At least…

967
01:21:31,469 --> 01:21:34,306
I can no longer hear the bells.

968
01:21:39,978 --> 01:21:42,397
Naksu will go to the soul shifters' grave.

969
01:21:43,189 --> 01:21:46,318
That is where she will meet her demise.

970
01:22:02,292 --> 01:22:04,892
You are the King's Star
who has been granted the power of the sky.

971
01:22:06,546 --> 01:22:09,674
This is not your end,

972
01:22:10,967 --> 01:22:12,093
Jang Uk.

973
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:41,122
Young Master Jang.

974
01:26:18,339 --> 01:26:22,385
A NEW ALCHEMY OF SOULS STORY
WILL BEGIN IN DECEMBER
