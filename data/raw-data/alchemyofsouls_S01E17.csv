1,17,1,00:00:36:01,00:00:37:23,Who are you and why are you following me?
1,17,2,00:00:38:18,00:00:39:18,I said…
1,17,3,00:00:41:21,00:00:43:03,who are you?
1,17,4,00:01:03:03,00:01:05:00,"Seeing that you recognize this sword,"
1,17,5,00:01:05:15,00:01:06:20,you must be a mage.
1,17,6,00:01:09:10,00:01:11:04,Put down your sword.
1,17,7,00:01:13:04,00:01:16:22,"It is dangerous to unsheathe
a sword of Cheonbugwan here."
1,17,8,00:01:19:22,00:01:21:23,This is Gaema Village.
1,17,9,00:01:23:01,00:01:26:03,"Cheonbugwan mages who patrol for sorcery
are considered enemies."
1,17,10,00:01:27:21,00:01:29:01,If you get into a fight
1,17,11,00:01:29:03,00:01:31:14,"and people find out that you are here,"
1,17,12,00:01:32:15,00:01:34:16,you will not be safe.
1,17,13,00:01:42:14,00:01:43:17,It looks as though
1,17,14,00:01:44:17,00:01:46:10,you know who I am.
1,17,15,00:01:48:07,00:01:50:15,"You carry the sword
of Cheonbugwan's Gwanju,"
1,17,16,00:01:52:06,00:01:53:21,so you must be his son.
1,17,17,00:02:00:24,00:02:04:05,"Does Uk not know
what his father looks like?"
1,17,18,00:02:06:18,00:02:10:10,"Are there no portraits of his father
like the one here of his mother?"
1,17,19,00:02:10:12,00:02:12:22,"We do not have any portraits
of the Gwanju."
1,17,20,00:02:13:21,00:02:15:20,"Young Master never seemed
curious about him."
1,17,21,00:02:16:16,00:02:19:24,"He only saw his father as a baby,
so there is no way he would remember."
1,17,22,00:02:21:03,00:02:23:08,He would not recognize his father
1,17,23,00:02:23:10,00:02:25:02,even if he were to run into him.
1,17,24,00:02:28:13,00:02:31:14,"I only followed you
because I recognized the sword."
1,17,25,00:02:36:03,00:02:37:22,Do you know the owner of this sword?
1,17,26,00:02:40:12,00:02:43:06,"The man who abandoned that sword
was a madman."
1,17,27,00:02:44:21,00:02:46:22,His wife had an affair and died.
1,17,28,00:02:48:03,00:02:51:03,"Then he abandoned his own son
and public post and just ran away."
1,17,29,00:02:53:01,00:02:54:22,"Jang Gang, the man who went mad."
1,17,30,00:02:59:00,00:03:00:20,"Everyone secretly talks about him,"
1,17,31,00:03:01:14,00:03:03:19,but no one has ever said that to my face.
1,17,32,00:03:05:01,00:03:06:22,Do you hold a grudge against him?
1,17,33,00:03:09:18,00:03:10:21,What if I do?
1,17,34,00:03:11:23,00:03:14:22,"Will you take vengeance on me
on behalf of your father?"
1,17,35,00:03:18:23,00:03:20:09,No.
1,17,36,00:03:20:11,00:03:22:10,"Even if I am his son, it is not my place."
1,17,37,00:03:23:13,00:03:24:23,He would not want that.
1,17,38,00:03:27:04,00:03:30:01,Then why do you carry your father's sword?
1,17,39,00:03:30:03,00:03:32:03,"If I go around
denying that he is my father,"
1,17,40,00:03:33:02,00:03:34:05,it would make my mother
1,17,41,00:03:35:02,00:03:36:16,seem too pitiful.
1,17,42,00:03:40:19,00:03:41:22,Do-hwa…
1,17,43,00:03:45:15,00:03:48:01,Do-hwa was the biggest victim of it all.
1,17,44,00:03:57:22,00:03:59:14,Do you also know my mother?
1,17,45,00:04:01:16,00:04:05:01,"Do-hwa was the most beautiful woman
in all of Daeho."
1,17,46,00:04:06:24,00:04:09:24,Everyone in Daeho knew who she was.
1,17,47,00:04:10:14,00:04:13:16,"It seems like everyone in my family
is famous for something."
1,17,48,00:04:15:07,00:04:16:16,"I must say,"
1,17,49,00:04:16:18,00:04:20:07,"I did not expect to run into anyone
who recognized me at a place like this."
1,17,50,00:04:48:09,00:04:50:19,"This is where people
secretly practice sorcery"
1,17,51,00:04:50:21,00:04:52:18,despite it being banned by Songrim.
1,17,52,00:04:53:10,00:04:57:05,"What is the son of Cheonbugwan's Gwanju
doing at a place like this?"
1,17,53,00:04:57:07,00:04:58:20,"Well, I was told I would be able"
1,17,54,00:04:58:23,00:05:02:00,"to witness sorcery
such as curses and soul magic."
1,17,55,00:05:02:02,00:05:03:20,"You are a mage of Jeongjingak,"
1,17,56,00:05:04:08,00:05:06:08,"yet you go around
in search of such sorcery?"
1,17,57,00:05:07:16,00:05:08:18,Not exactly.
1,17,58,00:05:09:21,00:05:12:10,"I am here to find a shaman
who performs such sorcery."
1,17,59,00:05:14:10,00:05:15:13,A shaman?
1,17,60,00:05:16:09,00:05:18:24,"She was a shaman
who was very good at soul magic,"
1,17,61,00:05:19:15,00:05:21:14,"which bewitches souls
and drives people mad."
1,17,62,00:05:23:14,00:05:25:02,She was caught 20 years ago
1,17,63,00:05:25:04,00:05:28:11,"by the mages of Cheonbugwan
and ran away after her house burned down."
1,17,64,00:05:30:21,00:05:32:21,"What business do you have
with Shaman Choi?"
1,17,65,00:05:33:09,00:05:35:11,How did you know that was Shaman Choi?
1,17,66,00:05:37:23,00:05:41:12,"By any chance, were you
one of the Cheonbugwan mages"
1,17,67,00:05:42:06,00:05:43:22,who worked with my father?
1,17,68,00:05:45:20,00:05:48:02,The Choi family was a family of mages
1,17,69,00:05:49:04,00:05:52:10,"that was destroyed by Master Seo Gyeong
a long time ago."
1,17,70,00:05:54:21,00:05:56:15,Your curiosity will put you in danger.
1,17,71,00:05:57:08,00:06:00:01,"If you become consumed
by your curiosity for sorcery,"
1,17,72,00:06:01:04,00:06:04:03,"its darkness will take over your soul,"
1,17,73,00:06:04:05,00:06:06:02,and you could end up losing everything.
1,17,74,00:06:08:07,00:06:09:18,"Once that happens,"
1,17,75,00:06:10:22,00:06:12:15,it will be too late to go back.
1,17,76,00:06:19:11,00:06:22:06,"Stop looking for those
who perform sorcery."
1,17,77,00:06:23:04,00:06:25:10,"The world does not approve of such things,"
1,17,78,00:06:26:11,00:06:27:23,and you will never be forgiven.
1,17,79,00:06:34:18,00:06:35:20,Wait.
1,17,80,00:06:41:05,00:06:42:10,Here.
1,17,81,00:06:48:00,00:06:49:09,Are you hurt?
1,17,82,00:06:50:01,00:06:52:04,"Yes, I am hurt."
1,17,83,00:06:53:23,00:06:56:13,"I am damaged
to the very depths of my soul."
1,17,84,00:07:09:18,00:07:11:20,Did he end up that way because of sorcery?
1,17,85,00:07:43:00,00:07:44:03,Bu-yeon!
1,17,86,00:07:45:13,00:07:46:17,"My goodness, Bu-yeon!"
1,17,87,00:08:08:09,00:08:10:24,Did she just look at me?
1,17,88,00:08:13:12,00:08:14:23,I am sorry.
1,17,89,00:08:15:00,00:08:17:04,Could you pick up the cane for me?
1,17,90,00:08:18:05,00:08:20:12,"She is the girl I ran into
in front of the house."
1,17,91,00:08:39:00,00:08:40:07,Mother!
1,17,92,00:08:45:24,00:08:46:24,Mother.
1,17,93,00:08:48:07,00:08:49:17,Is she really Bu-yeon?
1,17,94,00:08:50:15,00:08:53:00,"Yes, she is your sister."
1,17,95,00:08:54:06,00:08:55:16,Bu-yeon.
1,17,96,00:09:00:23,00:09:03:22,"Bu-yeon, let me take you to your room."
1,17,97,00:09:36:00,00:09:39:03,You are Jang Uk's maid.
1,17,98,00:09:39:19,00:09:41:21,What are you doing here?
1,17,99,00:09:43:20,00:09:47:03,"I came to help Young Lady Jin run away
from home due to her relationship."
1,17,100,00:09:47:05,00:09:49:17,But it looks like I just should leave.
1,17,101,00:09:49:19,00:09:51:10,I will be off now.
1,17,102,00:10:02:03,00:10:03:19,Why was Mu-deok here?
1,17,103,00:10:04:08,00:10:06:04,I was sure she did not recognize me.
1,17,104,00:10:07:07,00:10:09:02,Should I have just killed her?
1,17,105,00:10:10:15,00:10:13:19,"Bu-yeon, I left your room untouched."
1,17,106,00:10:14:13,00:10:17:19,"After all, I knew that
this day would come."
1,17,107,00:10:29:03,00:10:30:08,Let us go inside.
1,17,108,00:10:47:15,00:10:49:21,All your belongings
1,17,109,00:10:50:22,00:10:52:11,are still here.
1,17,110,00:10:53:13,00:10:56:01,"After I almost died
when I was washed up in the lake,"
1,17,111,00:10:57:13,00:11:01:09,"I always had to wander,
unable to find a proper place to stay."
1,17,112,00:11:02:02,00:11:03:20,"But now, I have my own room."
1,17,113,00:11:07:13,00:11:10:05,"I had no idea I had a mother
waiting for me to return."
1,17,114,00:11:13:01,00:11:17:04,Every day was full of misery and distress.
1,17,115,00:11:22:09,00:11:23:20,My poor daughter.
1,17,116,00:11:25:05,00:11:27:15,"I will make sure
you are always happy from now on."
1,17,117,00:11:29:00,00:11:30:10,Do not worry.
1,17,118,00:11:34:07,00:11:35:12,Mother.
1,17,119,00:11:51:22,00:11:56:04,"Did Jin Mu really bring home
Lady Jin's daughter?"
1,17,120,00:11:58:10,00:12:01:12,"Yes, the girl he brought
opened the doors of Jinyowon."
1,17,121,00:12:02:13,00:12:04:11,"- What?
- She opened the doors?"
1,17,122,00:12:04:13,00:12:07:23,"It takes more than a mere trick
to open those doors."
1,17,123,00:12:08:00,00:12:11:10,"They can only be opened
by the members of the Jin family."
1,17,124,00:12:14:13,00:12:19:02,"Does this really mean
Jin Bu-yeon has returned?"
1,17,125,00:12:28:17,00:12:32:08,"Why do my eyes hurt like crazy
every time I go to Jinyowon?"
1,17,126,00:12:39:14,00:12:41:12,"Is it because of
the power of their relics?"
1,17,127,00:13:01:04,00:13:02:18,"Mu-deok, what are you doing here?"
1,17,128,00:13:03:21,00:13:05:16,Why were you looking in the mirror?
1,17,129,00:13:09:15,00:13:11:04,Did you want to look nice for me?
1,17,130,00:13:12:10,00:13:13:19,Do not be ridiculous.
1,17,131,00:13:14:11,00:13:15:14,Wait.
1,17,132,00:13:15:16,00:13:17:11,I want to make myself look nice.
1,17,133,00:13:18:02,00:13:21:01,"How about you pick something suitable
for your young master?"
1,17,134,00:13:23:21,00:13:25:07,I will pick one myself.
1,17,135,00:13:30:04,00:13:31:20,What do you think? Does it suit me?
1,17,136,00:13:31:22,00:13:34:21,"Yes, sure. You look fabulous."
1,17,137,00:13:35:09,00:13:37:13,Of course it would look nice on me.
1,17,138,00:13:38:10,00:13:39:19,Let me see.
1,17,139,00:13:41:23,00:13:43:13,This looks nice on me too.
1,17,140,00:13:43:15,00:13:45:12,"This is just too hard.
Everything suits me."
1,17,141,00:13:51:00,00:13:52:09,What is this?
1,17,142,00:13:52:21,00:13:55:22,Give me that. I will doll you up.
1,17,143,00:14:01:19,00:14:05:02,Look at you. You look stunning.
1,17,144,00:14:05:14,00:14:07:24,It looks like I am all dolled up now.
1,17,145,00:14:08:01,00:14:09:13,"Now, it is your turn."
1,17,146,00:14:15:04,00:14:17:01,"Look at how pretty you look, Mu-deok."
1,17,147,00:14:19:03,00:14:22:04,"How childish of you.
I thought you only liked my eyes."
1,17,148,00:14:22:06,00:14:24:23,"I know, right?
I only thought your eyes were pretty."
1,17,149,00:14:26:08,00:14:28:22,"But your poison must have done
a number on me."
1,17,150,00:14:28:24,00:14:30:20,"Now, you look pretty no matter what."
1,17,151,00:14:40:20,00:14:44:11,I see you are trying hard not to love me.
1,17,152,00:14:44:13,00:14:45:13,You seem distressed.
1,17,153,00:14:50:01,00:14:52:08,Not at all. You could not be more wrong.
1,17,154,00:14:55:21,00:14:59:11,"If you are going to lie to my face,
at least try not to show it."
1,17,155,00:14:59:13,00:15:02:02,You are blushing right now.
1,17,156,00:15:04:21,00:15:07:20,"That is because
you put all this blush on my face."
1,17,157,00:15:07:22,00:15:09:00,Let me see.
1,17,158,00:15:11:19,00:15:14:04,"I must have applied too much.
It will not come off."
1,17,159,00:15:17:07,00:15:18:18,You kind of
1,17,160,00:15:19:12,00:15:22:03,look like a drunk dog right now.
1,17,161,00:15:25:12,00:15:28:20,"You should not glare like that.
You look like a dog about to bite."
1,17,162,00:15:28:22,00:15:31:05,I might as well just bite you.
1,17,163,00:15:33:10,00:15:35:16,I will not bite. Come here.
1,17,164,00:15:39:03,00:15:41:17,All right. Stop.
1,17,165,00:15:44:23,00:15:47:06,I had to buy this because of you.
1,17,166,00:15:48:09,00:15:51:16,"Do not use it if you do not need it.
I will use it for myself."
1,17,167,00:15:53:06,00:15:54:24,This is pretty too.
1,17,168,00:16:57:02,00:16:58:02,Mu-deok…
1,17,169,00:17:15:01,00:17:16:17,You were almost hit by the wagon.
1,17,170,00:17:26:04,00:17:27:13,Mu-deok.
1,17,171,00:17:27:15,00:17:30:16,"Are you really drunk or something?
Did you drink without me?"
1,17,172,00:17:33:09,00:17:36:06,"I had a drink too.
How about we have some more together?"
1,17,173,00:17:37:00,00:17:38:14,I am not drunk.
1,17,174,00:17:39:12,00:17:40:24,Were you out drinking?
1,17,175,00:17:41:01,00:17:43:21,"I went to Gaema Village
and someone let me have a drink."
1,17,176,00:17:44:10,00:17:46:20,Did you meet Shaman Choi there?
1,17,177,00:17:48:07,00:17:50:19,"I found a connection
between her and Jin Mu."
1,17,178,00:17:50:21,00:17:53:17,"But I also ran into
the Crown Prince there."
1,17,179,00:17:54:11,00:17:55:13,The Crown Prince?
1,17,180,00:17:55:15,00:17:59:00,"His Royal Highness is also suspicious
of Jin Mu and the Queen."
1,17,181,00:18:06:21,00:18:07:21,Your Royal Highness.
1,17,182,00:18:09:07,00:18:11:02,Are you coming back from Gaema Village?
1,17,183,00:18:12:04,00:18:13:04,Yes.
1,17,184,00:18:13:16,00:18:16:12,"The place was like a maze.
It was hard to find my way out."
1,17,185,00:18:17:05,00:18:18:05,What is it?
1,17,186,00:18:18:19,00:18:21:17,"- Is there something the matter?
- The Assistant Gwanju is here."
1,17,187,00:18:42:12,00:18:46:13,"Where did you go all by yourself
without a single person to escort you?"
1,17,188,00:18:47:05,00:18:50:10,"It is embarrassing enough to be caught
after sneaking out. Please let it slide."
1,17,189,00:18:52:20,00:18:54:21,I just met His Majesty.
1,17,190,00:18:55:13,00:18:57:12,He brought up the King's Star again.
1,17,191,00:18:59:10,00:19:00:21,He seems to want it so much.
1,17,192,00:19:00:23,00:19:04:14,"You should just give him a fake
constellation plate with the King's Star."
1,17,193,00:19:04:16,00:19:06:24,"Then he must find everyone
who was born that day"
1,17,194,00:19:07:01,00:19:08:14,and kill them.
1,17,195,00:19:10:06,00:19:11:12,Why?
1,17,196,00:19:11:24,00:19:13:22,It could be a hero like Master Seo Gyeong
1,17,197,00:19:13:24,00:19:16:22,"instead of being a traitor
wishing to conspire against the king."
1,17,198,00:19:16:24,00:19:19:12,"They say Seo Gyeong saved the world
with the ice stone."
1,17,199,00:19:19:14,00:19:20:14,But that is not true.
1,17,200,00:19:22:08,00:19:24:20,"In truth, he controlled the world
by forbidding everyone"
1,17,201,00:19:24:22,00:19:26:11,from using that immense power.
1,17,202,00:19:27:11,00:19:30:06,"The ice stone enables sorcery,
which is why it is dangerous."
1,17,203,00:19:30:08,00:19:32:12,That is the logic set by Songrim.
1,17,204,00:19:33:09,00:19:36:22,"The ice stone has the power
to bring eternity to finite things."
1,17,205,00:19:38:02,00:19:39:14,"Instead of aging and dying,"
1,17,206,00:19:39:16,00:19:43:08,"its power could enable us
to stay young and beautiful."
1,17,207,00:19:43:10,00:19:45:03,"Are you talking about
the alchemy of souls?"
1,17,208,00:19:45:05,00:19:47:03,The sorcery that was banned by Songrim.
1,17,209,00:19:47:05,00:19:48:19,But what if the ban gets lifted
1,17,210,00:19:48:21,00:19:50:19,"and the use of the ice stone
becomes permissible?"
1,17,211,00:19:50:21,00:19:51:23,Your Royal Highness.
1,17,212,00:19:52:18,00:19:54:11,What do you think would happen then?
1,17,213,00:19:57:21,00:20:01:08,"Those who possess the ice stone
will be able to live forever."
1,17,214,00:20:02:13,00:20:05:16,"But it would be dangerous if that kind
of power can be used by anyone."
1,17,215,00:20:05:18,00:20:07:15,Not everyone will be able to use it.
1,17,216,00:20:07:17,00:20:10:11,"We will create a new order
where only those specially chosen,"
1,17,217,00:20:10:13,00:20:13:01,"like you, Your Royal Highness,
will be allowed to use its power."
1,17,218,00:20:16:15,00:20:18:11,We need to find the ice stone
1,17,219,00:20:18:13,00:20:21:04,in order for that to become possible.
1,17,220,00:20:21:21,00:20:24:16,"Jin Bu-yeon, the long-lost daughter
of Jinyowon, has returned."
1,17,221,00:20:24:18,00:20:26:18,"- Jinyowon?
- The woman who helped"
1,17,222,00:20:26:20,00:20:31:00,"Master Seo Gyeong find the ice stone
was the first leader of Jinyowon."
1,17,223,00:20:31:02,00:20:33:07,And Jin Bu-yeon has divine powers
1,17,224,00:20:33:09,00:20:35:04,that parallel that of the first leader.
1,17,225,00:20:40:00,00:20:42:23,"If the ice stone appears
just like it did 200 years ago,"
1,17,226,00:20:43:00,00:20:44:21,the priestess of Jinyowon
1,17,227,00:20:46:01,00:20:48:03,will surely find it once again.
1,17,228,00:20:52:02,00:20:54:09,"The eldest daughter of Jinyowon
has returned alive."
1,17,229,00:20:54:21,00:20:57:18,She seemed like an ordinary blind girl.
1,17,230,00:20:58:11,00:21:00:06,I thought she was a powerful priestess.
1,17,231,00:21:01:02,00:21:02:12,I wonder if she lost her power.
1,17,232,00:21:02:14,00:21:03:24,I guess it is possible
1,17,233,00:21:04:01,00:21:07:01,"seeing that she failed
to find her way home for ten years."
1,17,234,00:21:09:24,00:21:13:14,"She was brought here by Jin Mu.
There is no way she is ordinary."
1,17,235,00:21:13:16,00:21:15:05,Did you notice anything peculiar?
1,17,236,00:21:18:16,00:21:21:09,"I ran into her once
in front of your house."
1,17,237,00:21:23:09,00:21:26:02,"I remember because I picked up
the cane she had dropped."
1,17,238,00:21:28:10,00:21:29:18,She was in front of my house?
1,17,239,00:21:29:20,00:21:32:02,"But nothing about her
seemed peculiar that day."
1,17,240,00:21:32:04,00:21:33:19,The same goes for today.
1,17,241,00:21:37:14,00:21:38:14,The umbrella…
1,17,242,00:21:42:06,00:21:44:06,She was carrying an umbrella.
1,17,243,00:21:44:08,00:21:46:06,I have seen that umbrella somewhere.
1,17,244,00:21:46:21,00:21:49:18,"An umbrella?
What is so special about an umbrella?"
1,17,245,00:21:49:20,00:21:50:21,No.
1,17,246,00:21:50:23,00:21:53:18,"That umbrella was made
with high-quality sheepskin and bamboo."
1,17,247,00:21:54:13,00:21:56:00,It was very expensive.
1,17,248,00:21:57:05,00:21:59:12,"- How did it end up with her?
- Why?"
1,17,249,00:21:59:14,00:22:01:03,Who did it originally belong to?
1,17,250,00:22:03:10,00:22:04:11,The umbrella?
1,17,251,00:22:05:00,00:22:06:20,I do not have that umbrella anymore.
1,17,252,00:22:07:10,00:22:08:21,I gave it to someone.
1,17,253,00:22:08:23,00:22:10:07,Who did you give it to and where?
1,17,254,00:22:11:01,00:22:12:19,It was not intentional.
1,17,255,00:22:12:21,00:22:14:17,I am sorry. I know you bought it for me.
1,17,256,00:22:15:08,00:22:16:22,You do not need to apologize.
1,17,257,00:22:17:10,00:22:19:08,Did you give it to a woman?
1,17,258,00:22:19:24,00:22:21:24,"Yes, I did give it to a woman."
1,17,259,00:22:22:01,00:22:23:01,Please do not be angry.
1,17,260,00:22:24:19,00:22:27:01,Why would I be angry?
1,17,261,00:22:27:03,00:22:28:13,Who was that woman?
1,17,262,00:22:29:03,00:22:30:03,Tell me.
1,17,263,00:22:30:05,00:22:32:17,"Will you answer me already?
This is so frustrating."
1,17,264,00:22:32:19,00:22:34:15,Who was the woman you gave it to?
1,17,265,00:22:38:02,00:22:39:16,Mu-deok.
1,17,266,00:22:39:18,00:22:42:03,That is not the way to ask. Yul is…
1,17,267,00:22:43:13,00:22:45:18,He is pale with fear.
1,17,268,00:22:45:20,00:22:48:02,"You sound like a wife
interrogating a cheating husband."
1,17,269,00:22:48:05,00:22:50:21,"It is inappropriate to ask him
with such a demanding tone."
1,17,270,00:22:51:17,00:22:53:13,Watch and learn. Yul.
1,17,271,00:22:53:15,00:22:56:12,"Did you give that umbrella
to a blind girl?"
1,17,272,00:22:57:06,00:22:58:06,How did you know that?
1,17,273,00:22:59:13,00:23:02:12,"By any chance, is she So-i,
the girl you mentioned last time?"
1,17,274,00:23:03:19,00:23:05:24,"Yes, I gave it to her."
1,17,275,00:23:06:01,00:23:07:04,Why do you ask?
1,17,276,00:23:08:05,00:23:09:11,"Today, I went to Jinyowon"
1,17,277,00:23:10:08,00:23:12:11,"and saw their long-lost daughter,
Jin Bu-yeon."
1,17,278,00:23:12:13,00:23:14:03,"She was blind,"
1,17,279,00:23:14:05,00:23:16:11,"but she was holding an umbrella
instead of a cane."
1,17,280,00:23:17:09,00:23:18:14,Was it the same umbrella?
1,17,281,00:23:22:02,00:23:23:02,Hey.
1,17,282,00:23:24:05,00:23:25:21,"Hey, did you hear?"
1,17,283,00:23:25:23,00:23:29:06,"They found Young Lady Jin's older sister.
They found Jin Bu-yeon."
1,17,284,00:23:31:00,00:23:32:01,Do you hear me?
1,17,285,00:23:32:19,00:23:34:13,What is with this atmosphere?
1,17,286,00:23:35:03,00:23:36:14,What were you talking about?
1,17,287,00:23:36:16,00:23:39:05,"We were talking about So-i,
the girl we were looking for."
1,17,288,00:23:39:20,00:23:40:20,So-i?
1,17,289,00:23:41:17,00:23:42:23,"Oh, the swindler?"
1,17,290,00:23:43:12,00:23:44:12,Did you find her?
1,17,291,00:23:44:13,00:23:46:21,The Jin Bu-yeon that Jin Mu has brought in
1,17,292,00:23:47:17,00:23:48:23,"is So-i, the swindler."
1,17,293,00:23:49:17,00:23:51:14,She must have killed all those people
1,17,294,00:23:51:17,00:23:53:14,to keep her identity a secret.
1,17,295,00:24:09:08,00:24:10:13,Jin Bu-yeon.
1,17,296,00:24:14:13,00:24:16:23,"I will make sure to become
indistinguishable from you."
1,17,297,00:24:34:13,00:24:36:23,"This is exactly the same
as the one that Mu-deok had."
1,17,298,00:24:40:02,00:24:41:19,Why is this here?
1,17,299,00:24:43:17,00:24:44:20,Bu-yeon.
1,17,300,00:24:52:24,00:24:54:03,Do you remember
1,17,301,00:24:55:07,00:24:56:08,this eye mask?
1,17,302,00:25:03:13,00:25:05:14,The eye masks you wore
1,17,303,00:25:05:16,00:25:08:23,were all embroidered by me.
1,17,304,00:25:09:16,00:25:11:21,I was always worried that
1,17,305,00:25:11:23,00:25:14:22,"something might happen to you
since you could not see."
1,17,306,00:25:14:24,00:25:19:07,"So I always made you wear an eye mask
that had the crest of Jinyowon on it."
1,17,307,00:25:21:21,00:25:23:02,I see.
1,17,308,00:25:27:08,00:25:29:17,"This may be old,
but it is made out of silk."
1,17,309,00:25:30:09,00:25:33:01,Your biological parents might be rich.
1,17,310,00:25:35:14,00:25:37:14,Are you sure you are blind?
1,17,311,00:25:38:12,00:25:40:12,"I cannot find spring water
even though I can see,"
1,17,312,00:25:40:14,00:25:42:17,but you have no trouble at all.
1,17,313,00:25:45:08,00:25:50:00,"Bu-yeon, you always had
the ability to sense energy."
1,17,314,00:25:50:17,00:25:54:20,"You could find things a lot better
than those who could see,"
1,17,315,00:25:55:09,00:25:58:05,"and you easily found your way
around places."
1,17,316,00:25:59:12,00:26:01:23,"That is exactly how Mu-deok was
in Sari Village."
1,17,317,00:26:02:00,00:26:04:24,"She found things easily
and always knew where she was going."
1,17,318,00:26:05:01,00:26:06:22,You were wearing the same eye mask
1,17,319,00:26:08:13,00:26:11:09,the very day you disappeared.
1,17,320,00:26:12:13,00:26:15:24,So I hoped that you might use the eye mask
1,17,321,00:26:17:09,00:26:18:17,to find your way back home.
1,17,322,00:26:19:20,00:26:22:04,She always cherished it
1,17,323,00:26:22:06,00:26:24:17,"saying it was the only way
to find her parents."
1,17,324,00:26:26:11,00:26:28:06,"If you had kept that with you,"
1,17,325,00:26:29:15,00:26:32:17,I would have recognized you at once.
1,17,326,00:26:33:20,00:26:37:06,"The eye mask that I stole from Mu-deok
was made by this woman."
1,17,327,00:26:38:09,00:26:39:24,"In any case,"
1,17,328,00:26:40:01,00:26:43:21,"thank you so much
for coming back alive, Bu-yeon."
1,17,329,00:26:50:18,00:26:53:08,"The real Jin Bu-yeon,
the daughter of this woman,"
1,17,330,00:26:54:01,00:26:56:03,is Mu-deok.
1,17,331,00:27:19:05,00:27:20:10,"My goodness, Bu-yeon!"
1,17,332,00:27:23:08,00:27:26:21,"I wonder if Mu-deok was the reason
why these doors opened that day."
1,17,333,00:27:28:24,00:27:30:12,Mu-deok is the real daughter.
1,17,334,00:27:32:00,00:27:34:12,"What will become of me
if she finds that out?"
1,17,335,00:27:37:08,00:27:38:19,Will I die?
1,17,336,00:27:44:18,00:27:45:24,Bu-yeon.
1,17,337,00:27:47:05,00:27:48:17,What are you doing here?
1,17,338,00:27:49:09,00:27:50:21,Are you trying to open the doors again?
1,17,339,00:27:50:21,00:27:52:01,No.
1,17,340,00:27:55:04,00:27:58:09,"I just cannot believe that
I am the daughter of this family."
1,17,341,00:27:59:14,00:28:01:03,Do not worry.
1,17,342,00:28:01:20,00:28:02:24,You can believe it.
1,17,343,00:28:03:01,00:28:05:24,We all saw you open those doors.
1,17,344,00:28:09:16,00:28:13:16,"By the way, about the girl
who was here with you last night…"
1,17,345,00:28:13:18,00:28:14:21,Mu-deok?
1,17,346,00:28:15:15,00:28:17:01,She is not a person of Jinyowon.
1,17,347,00:28:17:03,00:28:20:10,"Does she come here often?
Mother seemed to know her too."
1,17,348,00:28:20:12,00:28:22:05,Mother does not like her.
1,17,349,00:28:22:07,00:28:24:09,"She once caused trouble, you see."
1,17,350,00:28:24:11,00:28:25:18,Is that so?
1,17,351,00:28:28:00,00:28:29:09,So that is why.
1,17,352,00:28:29:11,00:28:31:11,I sensed bad energy from her.
1,17,353,00:28:32:12,00:28:34:24,Bad energy?
1,17,354,00:28:35:01,00:28:38:24,"The energy I sensed from that girl
was dark and unpleasant."
1,17,355,00:28:39:21,00:28:42:21,"You should not stay close to someone
with that kind of energy."
1,17,356,00:28:43:10,00:28:46:13,She is not that bad of a person.
1,17,357,00:28:47:16,00:28:48:24,There you girls are.
1,17,358,00:28:51:03,00:28:52:03,Father.
1,17,359,00:28:52:05,00:28:53:05,Father.
1,17,360,00:28:53:24,00:28:55:17,"Cho-yeon, your mother is looking for you."
1,17,361,00:28:56:06,00:28:57:09,Mother?
1,17,362,00:28:58:19,00:29:00:21,I thought she was no longer angry.
1,17,363,00:29:02:06,00:29:04:18,"- I should go then.
- Go on."
1,17,364,00:29:09:18,00:29:12:07,"I warned you to keep a distance
from my daughter."
1,17,365,00:29:13:01,00:29:14:04,I apologize.
1,17,366,00:29:15:02,00:29:17:14,"We must go to Cheonbugwan
on the last day of this month."
1,17,367,00:29:17:16,00:29:19:16,"- So be prepared.
- Yes."
1,17,368,00:29:21:02,00:29:22:08,"Father, wait."
1,17,369,00:29:24:22,00:29:26:03,My lord.
1,17,370,00:29:28:19,00:29:31:05,Are you sure Jin Bu-yeon is dead?
1,17,371,00:29:32:17,00:29:35:02,"What will happen to me
if she were to return?"
1,17,372,00:29:36:08,00:29:38:07,"You do not need to worry
about such a thing."
1,17,373,00:29:40:18,00:29:41:22,She is dead.
1,17,374,00:29:51:11,00:29:53:11,"Even if Mu-deok is their real daughter,"
1,17,375,00:29:53:13,00:29:55:05,no one in their family knows that.
1,17,376,00:29:56:09,00:29:58:07,I just need to make sure no one finds out.
1,17,377,00:30:01:16,00:30:03:03,I am Jin Bu-yeon.
1,17,378,00:30:15:07,00:30:16:22,I thought about it all night.
1,17,379,00:30:17:13,00:30:19:20,"Although this may put my love at risk,"
1,17,380,00:30:19:22,00:30:23:10,"I will do what I must
as the heir of Songrim."
1,17,381,00:30:23:12,00:30:26:00,"- I should tell my uncle.
- No."
1,17,382,00:30:26:02,00:30:29:10,"You all remember seeing him
arguing with Lady Jin, right?"
1,17,383,00:30:29:12,00:30:31:07,If we accuse her daughter
1,17,384,00:30:31:09,00:30:33:24,"of being a fake and a murderer
without any concrete evidence,"
1,17,385,00:30:34:12,00:30:36:18,"things could get ugly
between Songrim and Jinyowon."
1,17,386,00:30:37:24,00:30:39:02,You have a point.
1,17,387,00:30:39:04,00:30:43:02,"If the truth gets revealed, there will be
a fight between Jin Mu and Jinyowon."
1,17,388,00:30:43:18,00:30:46:06,"Songrim should not get involved
if we are not sure."
1,17,389,00:30:48:05,00:30:50:20,But why did they bring a swindler
1,17,390,00:30:50:22,00:30:52:15,to act as such a powerful priestess?
1,17,391,00:30:52:17,00:30:54:19,"Because they need someone
in that position."
1,17,392,00:30:55:17,00:30:56:20,What if she gets caught?
1,17,393,00:30:56:22,00:30:58:22,A mother would know her daughter.
1,17,394,00:30:58:24,00:31:02:10,"In the end, she will get caught.
Why do something so reckless?"
1,17,395,00:31:03:04,00:31:04:23,Because it does not matter.
1,17,396,00:31:07:04,00:31:08:19,Jin Mu must have something big
1,17,397,00:31:08:21,00:31:11:16,"so that even if Jin Ho-gyeong finds out
her daughter is a fake,"
1,17,398,00:31:12:20,00:31:14:22,"she will not be able
to do anything about it."
1,17,399,00:31:22:16,00:31:24:06,Something about her is different.
1,17,400,00:31:24:23,00:31:29:20,"She has the same scar and mole
that Bu-yeon had as a child."
1,17,401,00:31:31:04,00:31:32:19,But her ears are different.
1,17,402,00:31:34:12,00:31:36:24,The shape of our ears never changes.
1,17,403,00:31:39:12,00:31:41:12,Am I not remembering things correctly?
1,17,404,00:31:43:15,00:31:44:20,Ho-gyeong.
1,17,405,00:32:02:21,00:32:04:14,I am surprised you only wish to see
1,17,406,00:32:05:03,00:32:08:06,"the inside of Jinyowon
in return for helping me find Bu-yeon."
1,17,407,00:32:08:23,00:32:11:18,This place was forbidden to me
1,17,408,00:32:11:20,00:32:13:24,although I was a member of the Jin family.
1,17,409,00:32:14:01,00:32:16:07,I do remember severely punishing you
1,17,410,00:32:17:03,00:32:18:22,every time you came close to Jinyowon.
1,17,411,00:32:20:16,00:32:22:13,I admit I have been too harsh on you.
1,17,412,00:32:23:06,00:32:25:23,"I hated you for you were the result
of my father's affair,"
1,17,413,00:32:26:00,00:32:28:10,"and I despised you
for always trying so hard"
1,17,414,00:32:28:12,00:32:30:10,to please and butter everyone up.
1,17,415,00:32:31:03,00:32:32:12,I am sorry.
1,17,416,00:32:36:07,00:32:38:00,It is all in the past.
1,17,417,00:32:56:03,00:32:57:22,"Now that Bu-yeon is back,"
1,17,418,00:33:00:24,00:33:03:24,you should quickly choose your successor.
1,17,419,00:33:05:20,00:33:09:13,"Are you telling me to appoint her
as the next leader of Jinyowon?"
1,17,420,00:33:10:00,00:33:14:13,"Appointing a new owner
will bring back life to Jinyowon."
1,17,421,00:33:14:15,00:33:15:18,"Once that is done,"
1,17,422,00:33:15:20,00:33:19:20,"I will lay the groundwork for Cho-yeon
to become the Crown Princess."
1,17,423,00:33:24:01,00:33:25:10,There is no need to rush.
1,17,424,00:33:25:12,00:33:27:17,"Bu-yeon has not
fully recovered her memory,"
1,17,425,00:33:28:10,00:33:30:22,"and I am still capable
to stay as the leader."
1,17,426,00:33:30:24,00:33:35:12,"Your power is not enough for us
to retrieve the ice stone."
1,17,427,00:33:37:19,00:33:39:22,"When you were pregnant with Bu-yeon,"
1,17,428,00:33:39:24,00:33:42:22,"you unsealed the ice stone from Jinyowon
and gave it to Jang Gang"
1,17,429,00:33:43:13,00:33:44:21,in order to save her.
1,17,430,00:33:47:02,00:33:49:16,How do you know that?
1,17,431,00:33:49:18,00:33:50:23,Do not be startled.
1,17,432,00:33:51:00,00:33:53:07,"I am not trying to accuse you
of your wrongdoings."
1,17,433,00:33:54:16,00:33:57:17,"I bet Jang Gang insisted on
sealing the ice stone somewhere else"
1,17,434,00:33:57:19,00:33:59:08,and did not return it to you.
1,17,435,00:34:00:06,00:34:02:21,"Do you know
where Jang Gang hid the ice stone"
1,17,436,00:34:02:23,00:34:04:15,that he took from Jinyowon?
1,17,437,00:34:04:17,00:34:06:10,"Now that the successor
of Jinyowon is back,"
1,17,438,00:34:06:12,00:34:10:15,"I will return the ice stone
back to where it belongs."
1,17,439,00:34:11:18,00:34:14:04,"Jin Mu, are you saying…"
1,17,440,00:34:14:06,00:34:15:04,Ho-gyeong.
1,17,441,00:34:15:06,00:34:17:02,I just told you that I would return it.
1,17,442,00:34:17:21,00:34:19:20,"Do not be suspicious
or stand on your guard."
1,17,443,00:34:19:22,00:34:22:15,"Think of it as a gift that came
with your daughter's return."
1,17,444,00:34:22:17,00:34:26:07,"All you need to do is
just accept it with joy."
1,17,445,00:34:45:21,00:34:48:05,It sounds like you are telling me
1,17,446,00:34:48:19,00:34:52:19,"to blindly acknowledge Bu-yeon
if I wish to receive that gift."
1,17,447,00:34:52:22,00:34:56:08,"Get rid of your suspicions and doubts,
and you will be able to have it all."
1,17,448,00:34:57:10,00:35:00:21,"Both the ice stone
and your long-lost daughter."
1,17,449,00:35:02:13,00:35:04:04,What do you want?
1,17,450,00:35:08:07,00:35:10:18,You must fight Songrim
1,17,451,00:35:11:08,00:35:13:12,in order to protect the ice stone.
1,17,452,00:35:15:04,00:35:17:14,You want me to fight with Songrim?
1,17,453,00:35:17:16,00:35:19:07,The collapse of Songrim
1,17,454,00:35:20:08,00:35:23:21,"will allow us to possess
absolute power over the ice stone."
1,17,455,00:35:40:13,00:35:42:13,"Are you talking about
the alchemy of souls?"
1,17,456,00:35:42:16,00:35:44:18,The sorcery that was banned by Songrim.
1,17,457,00:35:45:23,00:35:47:10,But what if the ban gets lifted
1,17,458,00:35:47:13,00:35:49:13,"and the use of the ice stone
becomes permissible?"
1,17,459,00:35:49:15,00:35:50:18,Your Royal Highness.
1,17,460,00:35:51:12,00:35:53:07,What do you think would happen then?
1,17,461,00:35:56:04,00:35:58:00,An eternal life?
1,17,462,00:36:04:18,00:36:07:04,Has the petrification stopped?
1,17,463,00:36:07:06,00:36:09:17,He is able to breathe now.
1,17,464,00:36:10:20,00:36:12:17,He can also move his fingers and toes.
1,17,465,00:36:13:13,00:36:16:01,"Master Kang was a mage
with many years of training."
1,17,466,00:36:16:21,00:36:19:01,How did he become tempted to use sorcery?
1,17,467,00:36:19:03,00:36:22:07,"If Jin Mu were to approach me
and tell me I could shift my soul"
1,17,468,00:36:22:09,00:36:25:05,"into a younger and more beautiful body,
I would be tempted too."
1,17,469,00:36:27:09,00:36:31:07,"I am joking. But I am sure
many people will fall for that."
1,17,470,00:36:31:09,00:36:32:22,They are merely keeping quiet
1,17,471,00:36:32:24,00:36:34:13,because of Songrim.
1,17,472,00:36:36:12,00:36:39:10,"First, it was Cheonbugwan
and the royal palace."
1,17,473,00:36:39:12,00:36:43:19,"Now it looks like Jin Mu
even has influence over Jinyowon."
1,17,474,00:36:43:21,00:36:44:24,But we have evidence
1,17,475,00:36:45:01,00:36:48:10,"to prove that he has been
performing the alchemy of souls."
1,17,476,00:36:48:12,00:36:50:19,"Once Master Kang spills everything,"
1,17,477,00:36:50:21,00:36:53:03,we can finally put a stop to Jin Mu.
1,17,478,00:36:53:17,00:36:55:17,He is not scared that he got caught.
1,17,479,00:36:56:14,00:36:58:09,"Instead, he is already
plotting something new."
1,17,480,00:36:59:21,00:37:01:23,I have no way of telling
1,17,481,00:37:02:14,00:37:05:01,how far Jin Mu is willing to go from here.
1,17,482,00:37:06:12,00:37:07:24,And that scares me.
1,17,483,00:37:15:19,00:37:19:04,"What is the purpose of my visit
to Cheonbugwan this time?"
1,17,484,00:37:19:06,00:37:22:08,"Will I have to endure the pain
of another worm entering my body?"
1,17,485,00:37:22:10,00:37:24:10,Just do as you are told.
1,17,486,00:37:26:09,00:37:29:15,"There will be many others there,
so be careful of how you behave."
1,17,487,00:37:54:23,00:37:59:02,"Today, I shall finally reveal"
1,17,488,00:38:00:19,00:38:02:13,the Danju of our secret organization.
1,17,489,00:38:07:05,00:38:10:24,"Stand before everyone here
and show your face."
1,17,490,00:38:29:14,00:38:32:07,"The Danju is not only
the most powerful priestess of Daeho,"
1,17,491,00:38:32:09,00:38:35:11,"but also the future leader of Jinyowon.
Her name is Jin Bu-yeon."
1,17,492,00:38:38:00,00:38:40:10,Show your respect to the Danju.
1,17,493,00:38:55:20,00:38:58:18,"I will use her to bring the ice stone
out into the world."
1,17,494,00:39:00:01,00:39:01:23,Then I shall shift my soul into her body.
1,17,495,00:39:02:14,00:39:05:17,"That will allow me to serve you
from a closer distance,"
1,17,496,00:39:06:20,00:39:08:01,my sister.
1,17,497,00:39:23:00,00:39:26:14,"The leader of Jinyowon gathered
a Unanimous Assembly"
1,17,498,00:39:26:16,00:39:28:16,"- without discussing it with Songrim?
- Yes."
1,17,499,00:39:28:18,00:39:31:23,"She sent letters to all the families.
They are now heading to Songrim."
1,17,500,00:39:35:12,00:39:36:16,What in the world
1,17,501,00:39:36:18,00:39:40:13,is Jinyowon trying to do this time?
1,17,502,00:39:46:01,00:39:50:04,"She is the mother of the young man
who is currently lying in Sejukwon."
1,17,503,00:39:53:20,00:39:55:05,Why is everyone gathering here?
1,17,504,00:39:56:24,00:39:59:12,Jinyowon gathered the Unanimous Assembly.
1,17,505,00:40:03:02,00:40:04:13,Young Lady Cho-yeon is here.
1,17,506,00:40:05:06,00:40:07:22,Is that blind girl Jin Bu-yeon?
1,17,507,00:40:09:00,00:40:10:00,So-i?
1,17,508,00:40:11:07,00:40:12:07,Yes.
1,17,509,00:40:15:14,00:40:17:06,"Things are proceeding
faster than expected."
1,17,510,00:40:17:08,00:40:19:20,They are going to use the fake daughter
1,17,511,00:40:19:22,00:40:21:19,to get something done today.
1,17,512,00:40:30:02,00:40:32:08,She must be Jin Bu-yeon.
1,17,513,00:41:00:13,00:41:02:24,The leader of Jinyowon has invited
1,17,514,00:41:03:01,00:41:06:08,"the royal family and Cheonbugwan
to the Unanimous Assembly."
1,17,515,00:41:06:10,00:41:08:01,The Unanimous Assembly?
1,17,516,00:41:09:22,00:41:11:00,What for?
1,17,517,00:41:11:02,00:41:13:00,To announce a grave matter
1,17,518,00:41:13:02,00:41:16:01,that will determine the fate of Daeho.
1,17,519,00:41:25:08,00:41:28:21,"The capital has been suffering from chaos
due to many incidents"
1,17,520,00:41:28:23,00:41:30:24,regarding soul shifters
1,17,521,00:41:31:01,00:41:32:17,ever since the appearance of Naksu.
1,17,522,00:41:33:12,00:41:37:08,"Thus, Jinyowon has
generously tried to help Songrim"
1,17,523,00:41:37:10,00:41:39:06,find the source of sorcery.
1,17,524,00:41:40:09,00:41:41:09,"However,"
1,17,525,00:41:42:21,00:41:45:16,Songrim took our cooperation for granted
1,17,526,00:41:46:16,00:41:51:15,"and arrogantly began to make
unreasonable demands and requests."
1,17,527,00:41:53:20,00:41:57:02,"They barged into Jinyowon
as well as Cheonbugwan"
1,17,528,00:41:57:04,00:42:00:09,with the excuse of patrolling for sorcery.
1,17,529,00:42:00:11,00:42:03:22,"They also tried to use
the relics of Jinyowon"
1,17,530,00:42:03:24,00:42:05:20,to investigate all the families of mages
1,17,531,00:42:05:22,00:42:08:17,"as if they thought everyone
outside of Songrim performed sorcery."
1,17,532,00:42:09:12,00:42:11:18,"- Unbelievable.
- Worse than that,"
1,17,533,00:42:11:20,00:42:15:18,"they even took one of our relics
into the royal palace."
1,17,534,00:42:16:06,00:42:18:06,Did Songrim really cast doubt on us?
1,17,535,00:42:18:08,00:42:19:16,That is crossing the line.
1,17,536,00:42:23:12,00:42:25:09,"Lady Jin, did you gather"
1,17,537,00:42:25:11,00:42:28:14,"the Unanimous Assembly to vent
and complain about Songrim?"
1,17,538,00:42:28:16,00:42:29:16,Look at him.
1,17,539,00:42:29:17,00:42:32:00,"I have only just started speaking,"
1,17,540,00:42:32:02,00:42:33:24,and he is already trying to shut me up.
1,17,541,00:42:34:13,00:42:36:14,"I, Jin Ho-gyeong, the leader of Jinyowon,"
1,17,542,00:42:36:16,00:42:41:10,"wish to stop Songrim's arbitrary actions
they justify as patrolling for sorcery."
1,17,543,00:42:41:12,00:42:44:03,"That requires me to break
the 200-year-old rule"
1,17,544,00:42:44:05,00:42:49:04,"that has been kept until now,
which is why I have gathered you all."
1,17,545,00:42:52:23,00:42:53:23,Bu-yeon.
1,17,546,00:43:04:04,00:43:08:15,"She is Jin Bu-yeon,
the long-lost successor of Jinyowon"
1,17,547,00:43:08:17,00:43:10:02,who has returned after ten years.
1,17,548,00:43:13:16,00:43:14:23,I heard she found her daughter.
1,17,549,00:43:15:12,00:43:16:12,That must be her.
1,17,550,00:43:20:03,00:43:23:04,"I have something to show you
with the help of my daughter,"
1,17,551,00:43:23:06,00:43:25:21,who is also the successor of Jinyowon.
1,17,552,00:43:37:19,00:43:42:13,"Songrim has been going around
in search of the ice stone,"
1,17,553,00:43:42:15,00:43:44:13,the source of the alchemy of souls.
1,17,554,00:43:44:15,00:43:47:08,"However, that ice stone
has been inside Jinyowon all along."
1,17,555,00:44:35:05,00:44:37:03,So that was Jin Mu's plan.
1,17,556,00:44:37:16,00:44:40:24,"He wanted to use Jinyowon
to bring the ice stone into this world."
1,17,557,00:44:41:01,00:44:42:13,That cannot be all.
1,17,558,00:44:43:11,00:44:46:23,"The person who got caught
will try to shift souls."
1,17,559,00:44:49:21,00:44:51:00,What do you mean?
1,17,560,00:44:51:16,00:44:52:16,Do you not get it?
1,17,561,00:44:53:05,00:44:55:23,"The Queen had the ice stone,
but now it is with Jinyowon."
1,17,562,00:44:56:00,00:44:57:22,That means the shaman's soul will shift
1,17,563,00:44:58:24,00:45:01:03,"from the Queen's body
to someone at Jinyowon."
1,17,564,00:45:03:23,00:45:05:20,She will abandon the Queen's body
1,17,565,00:45:07:16,00:45:11:09,"and shift her soul into the body
of the future leader of Jinyowon…"
1,17,566,00:45:12:16,00:45:14:03,using the alchemy of souls.
1,17,567,00:45:27:03,00:45:28:21,That one in the front looks nice.
1,17,568,00:45:29:14,00:45:30:24,I heard the Unanimous Assembly
1,17,569,00:45:31:01,00:45:33:13,"has gathered at Songrim
to talk about soul shifters."
1,17,570,00:45:33:15,00:45:35:07,"Yes, apparently."
1,17,571,00:45:36:11,00:45:39:06,"Do not buy unnecessary accessories.
Buy gold instead."
1,17,572,00:45:39:09,00:45:41:21,"Gold is the only thing you can trust
in times of chaos."
1,17,573,00:45:41:23,00:45:44:19,"Things will get busy
once the gathering is over."
1,17,574,00:45:44:21,00:45:45:17,Yes.
1,17,575,00:45:45:19,00:45:48:05,"Once it is over,
they will all come to drink"
1,17,576,00:45:48:07,00:45:50:23,"- and talk dirt about Songrim.
- Hey."
1,17,577,00:45:51:00,00:45:53:14,"Will you stop touching that
and just buy it already?"
1,17,578,00:45:53:16,00:45:56:04,"Goodness, give her some time."
1,17,579,00:45:56:06,00:45:57:17,I want to buy everything.
1,17,580,00:45:57:19,00:45:59:19,"- Let me try that.
- This one?"
1,17,581,00:46:04:11,00:46:07:01,"Everyone in the capital is
talking about the Unanimous Assembly"
1,17,582,00:46:07:03,00:46:08:23,and the attendance of the royal family.
1,17,583,00:46:09:23,00:46:13:03,"He will have to show himself
with all the fuss going around."
1,17,584,00:46:14:15,00:46:16:08,Are you talking about Master Jang?
1,17,585,00:46:17:12,00:46:21:21,"I found it strange that
Young Master Park kept asking me"
1,17,586,00:46:21:23,00:46:23:16,about Master Jang.
1,17,587,00:46:23:18,00:46:27:07,"The leader of Songrim also seemed
to be waiting for him to show up."
1,17,588,00:46:34:21,00:46:36:13,Keep this with you
1,17,589,00:46:36:15,00:46:38:10,and give it to him once he comes.
1,17,590,00:46:39:09,00:46:40:11,What is it?
1,17,591,00:46:41:07,00:46:42:10,Can I see what it is?
1,17,592,00:46:53:07,00:46:54:19,It is an empty piece of paper.
1,17,593,00:46:54:21,00:46:58:16,"Did you use a spell to write a letter
just like Words of the Heart?"
1,17,594,00:47:00:17,00:47:04:05,"Once Jang Gang reads that,
he will do what is written."
1,17,595,00:47:10:16,00:47:15:01,"By the way, do you not need
to attend the Unanimous Assembly?"
1,17,596,00:47:15:15,00:47:17:17,I am a pupil of Master Seo Gyeong.
1,17,597,00:47:19:05,00:47:20:19,"If I go there,"
1,17,598,00:47:20:21,00:47:25:21,"I will neither be able to admit nor deny
the actions of my master."
1,17,599,00:47:31:23,00:47:36:03,"Does this mean Master Seo Gyeong
left an ice stone unharmed?"
1,17,600,00:47:36:05,00:47:38:15,I thought he destroyed all of them.
1,17,601,00:47:38:17,00:47:40:09,Was Songrim aware of this?
1,17,602,00:47:40:12,00:47:42:18,"If so, everything that
Songrim has done until now"
1,17,603,00:47:42:20,00:47:45:19,"under the pretext of Master Seo Gyeong
would be considered fraud."
1,17,604,00:47:45:21,00:47:48:09,"- Do not speak nonsense.
- Fraud is what it is."
1,17,605,00:47:48:11,00:47:50:10,Songrim has enforced countless regulations
1,17,606,00:47:50:12,00:47:53:01,"on all the families of mages
under the guise of patrolling for sorcery."
1,17,607,00:47:53:01,00:47:54:07,Do you not agree?
1,17,608,00:47:54:09,00:47:56:15,"- I agree.
- You are right."
1,17,609,00:47:56:17,00:47:58:15,Did Songrim deceive us?
1,17,610,00:47:58:17,00:48:00:01,Have we been fooled?
1,17,611,00:48:00:03,00:48:02:12,"- Is that what it is?
- Everyone, calm down."
1,17,612,00:48:04:01,00:48:05:06,The mages of Songrim
1,17,613,00:48:05:08,00:48:09:05,"were not aware that
the ice stone was still inside Jinyowon."
1,17,614,00:48:09:23,00:48:11:24,We do not wish to hear your excuses.
1,17,615,00:48:12:01,00:48:13:09,We must discuss
1,17,616,00:48:13:11,00:48:17:07,"what is to be done about the ice stone
that Master Seo Gyeong left behind."
1,17,617,00:48:17:09,00:48:20:10,"We must destroy the ice stone
as it is the source of sorcery."
1,17,618,00:48:20:23,00:48:22:21,"That is what Master Seo Gyeong
would have wanted."
1,17,619,00:48:23:14,00:48:25:01,We must destroy the ice stone
1,17,620,00:48:25:22,00:48:28:01,in front of everyone here as witnesses.
1,17,621,00:48:28:14,00:48:31:10,"He was the one
who left the ice stone inside Jinyowon."
1,17,622,00:48:31:12,00:48:34:08,"Following his command
would be to leave it inside Jinyowon."
1,17,623,00:48:34:10,00:48:37:17,"Then you never should have
brought it outside in the first place."
1,17,624,00:48:37:19,00:48:41:07,"How could you expect Songrim to stay still
after having revealed its existence?"
1,17,625,00:48:41:09,00:48:44:04,Are you trying to make a fool of Songrim?
1,17,626,00:48:44:06,00:48:47:01,The leader of Jinyowon has a point.
1,17,627,00:48:47:03,00:48:48:14,She merely wishes to respect
1,17,628,00:48:48:16,00:48:50:19,"Master Seo Gyeong's intentions
by leaving it inside Jinyowon."
1,17,629,00:48:50:20,00:48:55:12,"Songrim no longer has a say
in what to do with the ice stone."
1,17,630,00:48:55:14,00:48:59:08,"Unbelievable. Do you not even care
what Songrim thinks anymore?"
1,17,631,00:48:59:23,00:49:01:14,"The purpose of this gathering
is to discuss"
1,17,632,00:49:01:15,00:49:04:11,"how to use the ice stone
based on Master Seo Gyeong's wishes."
1,17,633,00:49:04:13,00:49:06:22,"If Songrim has a problem with that,
you may leave."
1,17,634,00:49:06:24,00:49:08:13,"- Here, here.
- Agreed."
1,17,635,00:49:08:15,00:49:10:23,"Songrim has deceived us,
so stay out of this."
1,17,636,00:49:11:00,00:49:13:17,"- Yes, you have no say.
- Stay out of it."
1,17,637,00:49:13:19,00:49:14:24,Leave if you have a problem.
1,17,638,00:49:15:01,00:49:17:11,"- Just leave!
- Get out!"
1,17,639,00:49:17:13,00:49:18:22,So this is why Jin Mu
1,17,640,00:49:18:24,00:49:22:06,revealed the ice stone to the world.
1,17,641,00:49:22:08,00:49:25:06,"Now that Songrim's logic
no longer seems valid,"
1,17,642,00:49:25:08,00:49:27:17,no one is willing to listen to them.
1,17,643,00:49:34:19,00:49:36:02,What are you doing there?
1,17,644,00:49:36:17,00:49:37:23,If Songrim is against
1,17,645,00:49:38:00,00:49:40:16,"keeping the ice stone inside Jinyowon,"
1,17,646,00:49:41:04,00:49:44:05,"then how about
letting a third party keep it?"
1,17,647,00:49:45:04,00:49:46:14,So here is my proposal.
1,17,648,00:49:46:16,00:49:48:14,How about keeping it at Gisan?
1,17,649,00:49:49:03,00:49:50:24,"- Where did that idea come from?
- Gisan?"
1,17,650,00:49:51:01,00:49:52:23,Why should it be kept at Gisan?
1,17,651,00:49:53:00,00:49:54:17,You and your family are low-level mages.
1,17,652,00:49:54:19,00:49:55:19,What did you say?
1,17,653,00:49:55:20,00:49:58:15,"Your family has no right
to keep the ice stone."
1,17,654,00:49:58:17,00:50:00:15,"- We will not allow it.
- We have no right?"
1,17,655,00:50:01:05,00:50:04:10,"My family has been around the longest
in the history of Daeho."
1,17,656,00:50:04:12,00:50:06:18,"So we have every right
to protect the ice stone."
1,17,657,00:50:06:20,00:50:08:23,How dare you try to touch it!
1,17,658,00:50:09:00,00:50:11:15,"- Are you trying to start a fight?
- Speak for yourself!"
1,17,659,00:50:11:17,00:50:14:04,"- What do you think you are doing?
- Watch your tongue."
1,17,660,00:50:14:19,00:50:16:19,Who do you think you are?
1,17,661,00:50:16:21,00:50:18:22,You little shrimp!
1,17,662,00:50:18:24,00:50:20:10,Did you call me a shrimp?
1,17,663,00:50:20:12,00:50:21:23,"Hey, that is enough."
1,17,664,00:50:22:00,00:50:23:00,Get out of the way!
1,17,665,00:50:26:23,00:50:29:02,Did you just hit me?
1,17,666,00:50:29:04,00:50:31:05,"Damn you, old man!"
1,17,667,00:50:33:01,00:50:34:10,You little…
1,17,668,00:50:34:12,00:50:36:23,"Get off me, you punk!"
1,17,669,00:50:40:22,00:50:42:02,Did you just gather energy?
1,17,670,00:50:42:04,00:50:44:10,Fine. Go ahead and attack me.
1,17,671,00:50:44:12,00:50:46:02,"- Damn you.
- Go ahead."
1,17,672,00:50:46:16,00:50:47:14,Do you…
1,17,673,00:50:47:16,00:50:49:19,Do you think I will not be able to?
1,17,674,00:50:49:22,00:50:51:06,You are as impudent as you look.
1,17,675,00:50:51:08,00:50:53:08,Look who is talking.
1,17,676,00:50:54:04,00:50:56:10,"My grandfather is
at the Unanimous Assembly?"
1,17,677,00:50:56:12,00:50:57:12,Yes.
1,17,678,00:50:57:23,00:51:01:00,"I could not find the medical manual
you requested at Jeongjingak."
1,17,679,00:51:01:19,00:51:03:23,"I will go to Jeongjingak
and look for it myself."
1,17,680,00:51:05:03,00:51:07:07,The Unanimous Assembly must be a big deal.
1,17,681,00:51:07:09,00:51:10:06,"All the mages at Sejukwon
must have gone there."
1,17,682,00:51:14:04,00:51:17:17,"I was told that my son
is still alive here."
1,17,683,00:51:42:22,00:51:43:24,Ji-ho…
1,17,684,00:52:02:24,00:52:04:08,You are alive.
1,17,685,00:52:13:01,00:52:14:02,Ji-ho.
1,17,686,00:52:41:01,00:52:43:03,"Everyone, please settle down!"
1,17,687,00:52:46:14,00:52:47:23,I think it is time
1,17,688,00:52:48:00,00:52:50:19,"for Jin Ho-gyeong to get involved
and settle the issue."
1,17,689,00:53:00:04,00:53:03:06,Everyone! That is enough!
1,17,690,00:53:05:16,00:53:08:04,"- I will get back to you later!
- Fine by me!"
1,17,691,00:53:08:06,00:53:09:20,Consider yourself lucky.
1,17,692,00:53:10:15,00:53:11:15,Allow me to speak.
1,17,693,00:53:12:17,00:53:14:15,"Judging by everyone's opinions,"
1,17,694,00:53:14:17,00:53:16:18,it seems best that we use the ice stone
1,17,695,00:53:16:20,00:53:20:19,"left by Master Seo Gyeong
for the benefit of everyone here."
1,17,696,00:53:21:24,00:53:23:01,"Therefore,"
1,17,697,00:53:23:03,00:53:27:17,"I, Jin Ho-gyeong, the leader of Jinyowon,
would like to make a suggestion."
1,17,698,00:53:27:19,00:53:31:04,"How about giving the rights
to gather the Unanimous Assembly"
1,17,699,00:53:31:20,00:53:35:18,"to Jinyowon instead of Songrim
from now on?"
1,17,700,00:53:40:20,00:53:43:12,"If no one here is against the idea,"
1,17,701,00:53:43:14,00:53:45:10,I shall end the gathering here.
1,17,702,00:53:45:12,00:53:49:02,"And as of this moment on,
Jinyowon will take Songrim's place"
1,17,703,00:53:49:24,00:53:52:15,"and take charge of holding the discussions
regarding the ice stone."
1,17,704,00:53:58:05,00:53:59:18,I will take that as a yes
1,17,705,00:53:59:20,00:54:01:14,and end today's Unanimous Assembly.
1,17,706,00:54:03:11,00:54:06:20,"As for the ice stone,
it will remain inside Jinyowon."
1,17,707,00:54:08:00,00:54:09:14,The right thing to do
1,17,708,00:54:10:12,00:54:14:13,"is to destroy the ice stone
to prevent further quarrels."
1,17,709,00:54:14:15,00:54:17:02,"What gives Songrim the right
to make that decision?"
1,17,710,00:54:17:04,00:54:18:12,No one here agrees with it.
1,17,711,00:54:18:14,00:54:21:15,"The alchemy of souls has been performed,
and that was possible"
1,17,712,00:54:21:17,00:54:24:02,"because of the Soul Ejector
created from that ice stone."
1,17,713,00:54:24:04,00:54:26:09,"First, you cast doubt
on Cheonbugwan and the royal family."
1,17,714,00:54:26:09,00:54:28:18,"And now, you are
doing the same to Jinyowon."
1,17,715,00:54:30:07,00:54:33:15,"I will not allow
the Unanimous Assembly to end like this."
1,17,716,00:54:35:03,00:54:36:07,Lady Jin.
1,17,717,00:54:36:09,00:54:42:10,"I forbid you to take the ice stone
outside of Songrim."
1,17,718,00:54:42:12,00:54:45:15,"Are you trying to go up against
everyone here?"
1,17,719,00:54:45:17,00:54:47:01,No one is allowed
1,17,720,00:54:48:06,00:54:50:15,to take the ice stone outside of Songrim.
1,17,721,00:54:59:19,00:55:01:05,I order you to fight
1,17,722,00:55:02:15,00:55:04:21,and stop anyone who attempts to do so.
1,17,723,00:55:08:20,00:55:10:21,A war will break out at this rate.
1,17,724,00:55:19:03,00:55:20:21,The situation has turned unstable.
1,17,725,00:55:20:23,00:55:22:19,"You should get involved, Your Majesty."
1,17,726,00:55:23:12,00:55:25:20,Master Lee was right.
1,17,727,00:55:25:22,00:55:28:15,"Everyone coveted it,
which led to endless fights."
1,17,728,00:55:28:17,00:55:30:07,And that is why it was banned.
1,17,729,00:55:32:06,00:55:34:04,"Everyone is fighting over the ice stone,"
1,17,730,00:55:34:20,00:55:36:01,which means Master Lee
1,17,731,00:55:36:03,00:55:38:11,must also be right about the King's Star.
1,17,732,00:56:23:02,00:56:25:24,"I can see that
all of my former masters are here."
1,17,733,00:56:26:18,00:56:29:14,"Allow your former pupil, Jang Uk,
to greet all of you."
1,17,734,00:56:30:13,00:56:32:07,Who is that young man?
1,17,735,00:56:32:09,00:56:33:16,He is Jang Uk.
1,17,736,00:56:33:18,00:56:36:12,"The reckless son of the Jang family
who used to be my pupil."
1,17,737,00:56:37:09,00:56:39:20,"As I recall,
your family also tried to train him."
1,17,738,00:56:40:10,00:56:42:21,"Yes, I remember he ran away
in just three days."
1,17,739,00:56:42:23,00:56:46:01,"I apologize for interrupting
this passionate discussion"
1,17,740,00:56:46:16,00:56:49:10,with the sound of the drum.
1,17,741,00:56:52:03,00:56:54:22,"- What should I stop him?
- Let him talk."
1,17,742,00:56:55:12,00:56:58:13,"Whatever the case,
he managed to stop the fight."
1,17,743,00:56:59:06,00:57:00:21,"Jang Uk, son of Jang Gang."
1,17,744,00:57:02:24,00:57:06:01,"You had better have a good reason
for interfering like this"
1,17,745,00:57:06:03,00:57:08:09,in front of His Majesty the King.
1,17,746,00:57:12:14,00:57:15:00,"I am here to tell you
what Master Seo Gyeong wanted."
1,17,747,00:57:26:04,00:57:28:16,"I told him the true intentions
of Master Seo Gyeong."
1,17,748,00:57:28:18,00:57:30:12,I hope he uses it wisely.
1,17,749,00:57:36:14,00:57:40:05,"I tell you this on behalf of Master Lee,
a pupil of Master Seo Gyeong."
1,17,750,00:57:40:07,00:57:42:14,"So I expect everyone here
to show their respect"
1,17,751,00:57:42:16,00:57:44:13,and listen to Master Seo Gyeong's will.
1,17,752,00:57:53:05,00:57:55:07,"According to Master Lee,"
1,17,753,00:57:55:09,00:57:57:21,"Master Seo Gyeong's will
regarding the ice stone"
1,17,754,00:57:57:23,00:57:59:16,is written in Words of the Heart.
1,17,755,00:58:02:03,00:58:04:13,"He wrote down the reason
he left behind the ice stone"
1,17,756,00:58:04:15,00:58:07:04,"and left it for all the mages
of Jeongjingak to read,"
1,17,757,00:58:07:06,00:58:10:12,meaning Songrim did not hide anything.
1,17,758,00:58:13:15,00:58:17:02,"I believe most of you here
have also read Words of the Heart."
1,17,759,00:58:17:15,00:58:21:08,"Our job is to find his intentions
in Words of the Heart."
1,17,760,00:58:24:04,00:58:25:20,Do you remember what it was about?
1,17,761,00:58:25:22,00:58:28:14,"No, I read it too long ago."
1,17,762,00:58:28:16,00:58:30:08,Are you saying he wrote down
1,17,763,00:58:30:10,00:58:32:11,why he left the ice stone in that book?
1,17,764,00:58:34:06,00:58:35:08,Yes.
1,17,765,00:58:35:10,00:58:39:00,"I was told that everyone will follow
Master Seo Gyeong's wishes."
1,17,766,00:58:39:02,00:58:41:13,So what you should really be fighting over
1,17,767,00:58:41:16,00:58:43:22,"is Words of the Heart, not the ice stone."
1,17,768,00:58:43:24,00:58:47:02,"Where is the so-called Words of the Heart
that he is talking about?"
1,17,769,00:58:47:20,00:58:49:15,"Songrim had been keeping it,"
1,17,770,00:58:49:17,00:58:53:14,"but we recently sent it to Jinyowon
on Master Lee's orders."
1,17,771,00:58:55:07,00:58:57:21,It is being kept inside Jinyowon.
1,17,772,00:58:57:23,00:59:00:01,Then bring the book here.
1,17,773,00:59:02:05,00:59:03:09,"Yes, Your Majesty."
1,17,774,00:59:11:19,00:59:13:11,I am Jin Cho-yeon of Jinyowon.
1,17,775,00:59:14:06,00:59:16:03,I will bring Words of the Heart.
1,17,776,00:59:16:20,00:59:18:13,"As it used to belong to Songrim,"
1,17,777,00:59:18:15,00:59:20:20,I will send someone from Songrim as well.
1,17,778,00:59:21:13,00:59:24:02,"Dang-gu, I want you to go with her."
1,17,779,00:59:30:00,00:59:31:04,Let us go.
1,17,780,00:59:47:02,00:59:48:05,It has been decades
1,17,781,00:59:49:03,00:59:52:22,since I last read Words of the Heart.
1,17,782,00:59:52:24,00:59:55:02,Can you remind me what it was about?
1,17,783,00:59:55:04,00:59:57:09,It is just a short piece of poetry.
1,17,784,00:59:58:14,01:00:01:00,Then is Uk lying?
1,17,785,01:00:01:02,01:00:03:04,"It does not say anything
about the ice stone."
1,17,786,01:00:03:23,01:00:08:00,"I have no idea why he suddenly brought up
Words of the Heart."
1,17,787,01:00:11:01,01:00:13:14,What is inside Words of the Heart?
1,17,788,01:00:13:16,01:00:15:00,I do not know.
1,17,789,01:00:16:02,01:00:19:22,"He is probably just bluffing
to stall the situation."
1,17,790,01:00:20:11,01:00:22:18,But that book was written by Seo Gyeong.
1,17,791,01:00:23:11,01:00:26:04,"We barely managed
to break everyone's trust in Songrim."
1,17,792,01:00:26:06,01:00:28:14,"What if that causes everyone
to trust Songrim again?"
1,17,793,01:00:31:05,01:00:34:11,"Young Master Jang,
they seem extremely angry."
1,17,794,01:00:34:13,01:00:36:17,"Soon, they will also be startled."
1,17,795,01:00:37:14,01:00:38:20,"But to do that,"
1,17,796,01:00:39:20,01:00:41:01,I need his help.
1,17,797,01:00:53:20,01:00:56:00,This is nothing more than just poetry.
1,17,798,01:00:57:02,01:00:58:24,Is there a meaning behind this?
1,17,799,01:01:00:10,01:01:01:14,I am not sure.
1,17,800,01:01:02:15,01:01:05:07,"He must have used the book
to stop the fighting."
1,17,801,01:01:05:22,01:01:07:21,"If he did it to stall for time,"
1,17,802,01:01:08:09,01:01:10:04,I should take as much time as I can.
1,17,803,01:01:10:20,01:01:11:20,Let us hurry back.
1,17,804,01:01:12:11,01:01:13:15,"No, wait."
1,17,805,01:01:13:17,01:01:16:13,"I am extremely starving.
Do you have anything to eat?"
1,17,806,01:01:17:15,01:01:19:08,I did not even have breakfast.
1,17,807,01:01:20:00,01:01:23:06,"Are you purposely trying
to buy time for Songrim?"
1,17,808,01:01:26:08,01:01:29:06,"Do you want to return
and see everyone get into a dispute again?"
1,17,809,01:01:29:08,01:01:31:09,We have no time to argue.
1,17,810,01:01:31:11,01:01:32:24,My mother and sister are waiting.
1,17,811,01:01:33:20,01:01:35:06,Young Lady Jin.
1,17,812,01:01:36:20,01:01:38:07,Do you really think
1,17,813,01:01:39:09,01:01:41:04,she is your real sister?
1,17,814,01:01:42:21,01:01:43:22,Why do you ask?
1,17,815,01:01:43:24,01:01:49:07,"You know that the real culprit behind
the murder that Mu-deok was accused of"
1,17,816,01:01:49:09,01:01:51:02,"was a girl named So-i, right?"
1,17,817,01:01:53:13,01:01:55:11,The girl you believe to be your sister
1,17,818,01:01:56:20,01:01:58:03,is actually So-i.
1,17,819,01:02:00:10,01:02:01:14,What?
1,17,820,01:02:20:22,01:02:24:17,"I heard you told Cho-yeon that
you feel uneasy about that girl."
1,17,821,01:02:27:10,01:02:28:13,Yes.
1,17,822,01:02:30:10,01:02:32:12,I feel uneasy because I sense bad energy.
1,17,823,01:02:32:14,01:02:35:09,"I do not wish for her
to come near me ever again."
1,17,824,01:02:41:09,01:02:43:20,"I should always make sure
to keep you safe,"
1,17,825,01:02:44:15,01:02:45:23,so I will get rid of her.
1,17,826,01:02:52:04,01:02:53:19,"Thank you, Mother."
1,17,827,01:03:21:13,01:03:22:21,Her attitude has changed.
1,17,828,01:03:23:17,01:03:25:09,Does she know that she is fake?
1,17,829,01:03:26:20,01:03:28:20,"Is she using her, knowing she is fake?"
1,17,830,01:03:31:01,01:03:33:20,"Why did you use Words of the Heart
to stall for time?"
1,17,831,01:03:37:20,01:03:40:20,DAILY LOG OF CHEONBUGWAN
1,17,832,01:03:43:13,01:03:45:04,"""The fifth of May."""
1,17,833,01:03:45:06,01:03:47:11,"""While Cheonbugwan's Gwanju, Jang Gang,"

1,17,835,01:03:50:07,01:03:52:19,"she ran away into a fire."""
1,17,836,01:03:52:21,01:03:54:15,"""She is presumed dead."""
1,17,837,01:03:56:02,01:03:58:03,"The story we heard
from Shaman Bong at Gaema Village"
1,17,838,01:03:58:20,01:04:00:04,actually exists as a record.
1,17,839,01:04:00:18,01:04:04:14,"This is probably when Shaman Choi
and Jin Mu met."
1,17,840,01:04:04:16,01:04:07:20,"Why are you so persistent
about finding this Shaman Choi?"
1,17,841,01:04:07:22,01:04:11:07,"Did you find the house that
Eunuch Kim frequented at Gaema Village?"
1,17,842,01:04:12:17,01:04:14:00,"Yes, I did."
1,17,843,01:04:14:12,01:04:17:04,The place he frequented was an apothecary.
1,17,844,01:04:17:06,01:04:18:16,An apothecary?
1,17,845,01:04:19:06,01:04:21:21,"I have told you one thing,
so it is your turn to tell me."
1,17,846,01:04:23:11,01:04:24:15,Eunuch Kim
1,17,847,01:04:25:11,01:04:27:21,"referred to the person he served
as ""Shaman Choi."""
1,17,848,01:04:31:18,01:04:33:16,The person that Eunuch Kim served was…
1,17,849,01:04:33:18,01:04:35:12,"It was Her Highness, the Queen."
1,17,850,01:04:38:01,01:04:40:04,"I know you have also been
suspicious of her."
1,17,851,01:04:40:06,01:04:43:03,"The soul of the actual Queen
is still alive."
1,17,852,01:04:43:24,01:04:46:19,"She is most likely at the place
that Eunuch Kim kept going to."
1,17,853,01:04:47:18,01:04:49:14,How can you be sure that she is alive?
1,17,854,01:04:54:16,01:04:57:02,"The Queen's Lantern of Life
is still glowing."
1,17,855,01:04:57:04,01:04:59:00,She is a member of the Seo family.
1,17,856,01:04:59:17,01:05:01:00,I will find the real Queen
1,17,857,01:05:01:02,01:05:04:03,"and reveal the true identity of the one
at the Unanimous Assembly."
1,17,858,01:05:09:03,01:05:11:13,So you want me to get involved in this?
1,17,859,01:05:11:15,01:05:13:19,This is regarding your mother.
1,17,860,01:05:19:12,01:05:20:19,What do you plan to do
1,17,861,01:05:20:21,01:05:23:00,"with the ice stone
after you reveal everything?"
1,17,862,01:05:23:02,01:05:24:24,I will follow Master Seo Gyeong's wishes
1,17,863,01:05:25:01,01:05:26:24,"and do what is written
in Words of the Heart."
1,17,864,01:05:27:01,01:05:28:01,Uk.
1,17,865,01:05:28:22,01:05:31:02,"Words of the Heart
is not about the ice stone."
1,17,866,01:05:31:04,01:05:34:20,"I thought you lied
to buy yourself some time."
1,17,867,01:05:34:22,01:05:36:05,I did not lie.
1,17,868,01:05:36:23,01:05:38:15,The reason Master Seo Gyeong
1,17,869,01:05:38:17,01:05:41:15,"left the ice stone
is clearly written in Words of the Heart."
1,17,870,01:05:46:23,01:05:49:15,"The ice stone holds the power of Hwansu.
Am I correct?"
1,17,871,01:05:49:17,01:05:52:08,"It has the power
to control water, fire, and wind,"
1,17,872,01:05:52:10,01:05:55:08,"as well as the power
to freely control the souls of humans."
1,17,873,01:05:56:07,01:05:57:09,That is why
1,17,874,01:05:57:11,01:05:59:16,its power should be forbidden to mankind.
1,17,875,01:05:59:18,01:06:03:01,"It is hard to believe that
such a small piece of ice"
1,17,876,01:06:03:03,01:06:04:07,holds such great power.
1,17,877,01:06:04:09,01:06:05:21,I must see it for myself.
1,17,878,01:06:09:24,01:06:12:19,"Has anyone here witnessed its power
with their own two eyes?"
1,17,879,01:06:15:20,01:06:19:10,"Were you fighting over the ice stone
without even having witnessed its power?"
1,17,880,01:06:22:13,01:06:24:03,Then how about we check
1,17,881,01:06:25:06,01:06:27:14,"how powerful it is
with everyone here as a witness?"
1,17,882,01:06:28:08,01:06:30:10,How exactly do you suggest we do that?
1,17,883,01:06:30:12,01:06:31:17,"If it controls souls,"
1,17,884,01:06:32:10,01:06:35:01,"then it should be able to bring back
a dead person to life."
1,17,885,01:06:36:14,01:06:39:07,"The power of Hwansu is not sorcery,
so it is not forbidden."
1,17,886,01:06:39:09,01:06:41:07,"And bringing someone back to life
is a good deed."
1,17,887,01:06:42:20,01:06:44:11,"Lady Jin, you brought the ice stone here,"
1,17,888,01:06:45:15,01:06:47:02,so you should show its power to us.
1,17,889,01:06:48:13,01:06:49:22,Your Majesty.
1,17,890,01:06:49:24,01:06:53:00,"No one here is dead.
Who are we supposed to bring back to life?"
1,17,891,01:06:54:10,01:06:56:02,Then kill someone.
1,17,892,01:07:02:00,01:07:03:00,"Hey, you."
1,17,893,01:07:06:08,01:07:08:13,Come over here.
1,17,894,01:07:10:20,01:07:11:20,"Yes, Your Majesty."
1,17,895,01:07:17:01,01:07:18:17,Kill her and then bring her back to life.
1,17,896,01:07:19:07,01:07:20:20,She is a maid who knows no spells.
1,17,897,01:07:21:10,01:07:24:15,"So you will not have to worry about her
getting close to the ice stone."
1,17,898,01:07:24:17,01:07:25:13,Your Majesty.
1,17,899,01:07:25:15,01:07:28:00,"We cannot kill someone
for a mere experiment."
1,17,900,01:07:28:02,01:07:29:24,"What I want is
to see her come back to life"
1,17,901,01:07:30:13,01:07:31:10,with this.
1,17,902,01:07:31:12,01:07:33:13,"How could you ask someone
so young and weak"
1,17,903,01:07:33:15,01:07:35:23,to do something so fearful?
1,17,904,01:07:39:13,01:07:40:15,Tell me.
1,17,905,01:07:41:18,01:07:43:00,Are you too scared?
1,17,906,01:07:46:14,01:07:48:03,I will pay you 100 yangs worth of gold.
1,17,907,01:07:48:19,01:07:50:02,What do you say?
1,17,908,01:07:53:12,01:07:54:14,Yes.
1,17,909,01:07:55:09,01:07:56:13,I will try it.
1,17,910,01:07:57:23,01:07:59:01,I will sacrifice myself
1,17,911,01:07:59:20,01:08:03:09,"to show the very power
that you and everyone here"
1,17,912,01:08:04:11,01:08:06:08,wish to witness.
1,17,913,01:08:34:19,01:08:37:03,"This is finally my chance
to acquire the ice stone."
1,17,914,01:08:38:22,01:08:43:10,"In order to succeed in doing that,
I must die first."
1,17,915,01:08:45:03,01:08:49:03,"No one here cares about
whether I live or die."
1,17,916,01:08:50:09,01:08:52:24,They only desire to witness
1,17,917,01:08:53:11,01:08:55:10,the power of the ice stone.
1,17,918,01:09:15:20,01:09:17:24,"I have no way of knowing
if I will just die"
1,17,919,01:09:18:12,01:09:22:07,"or retrieve my power
through the ice stone."
1,17,920,01:09:23:13,01:09:25:15,"I have pushed myself
to the edge of a cliff"
1,17,921,01:09:26:14,01:09:29:15,with the ice stone in front of me.
1,17,922,01:09:29:17,01:09:31:05,I also missed you.
1,17,923,01:09:34:12,01:09:35:12,That is my reply.
1,17,924,01:09:36:16,01:09:40:02,"I am relieved that you did not
have to stand here beside me."
1,17,925,01:09:41:06,01:09:44:00,"It was a desire to save the person
he cared about."
1,17,926,01:09:44:14,01:09:46:16,Master Seo Gyeong's Words of the Heart
1,17,927,01:09:46:18,01:09:49:03,was a letter written to a dying lover.
1,17,928,01:09:49:05,01:09:52:01,"He wrote that he left something behind
in hopes to keep her by his side."
1,17,929,01:09:52:03,01:09:53:22,Are you saying the great hero
1,17,930,01:09:54:20,01:09:57:05,"who destroyed the ice stone
to save the world"
1,17,931,01:09:57:07,01:10:00:13,"was tempted to use it
just to save someone's life?"
1,17,932,01:10:00:15,01:10:02:17,"It shows the foolishness
and heartache of a man"
1,17,933,01:10:03:09,01:10:06:02,"who was willing to go against
the laws of nature to save a loved one."
1,17,934,01:10:06:20,01:10:11:20,"That is Master Seo Gyeong's confession
in Words of the Heart."
1,17,935,01:10:16:17,01:10:19:11,"I am not happy
about this situation either."
1,17,936,01:10:21:06,01:10:23:15,I will make sure you die a painless death.
1,17,937,01:10:25:08,01:10:27:17,This is not to see me die.
1,17,938,01:10:28:24,01:10:31:00,It is to see me come back to life.
1,17,939,01:10:34:16,01:10:36:01,Bring me back to life
1,17,940,01:10:37:02,01:10:38:17,so no one here is disappointed.
1,17,941,01:10:40:18,01:10:42:11,Then let us not disappoint anyone.
1,17,942,01:10:46:02,01:10:48:06,A mother will be killing her own daughter.
1,17,943,01:11:44:09,01:11:45:13,You look beautiful.
1,17,944,01:11:47:01,01:11:48:21,My Bu-yeon.
1,17,945,01:11:57:17,01:11:58:20,Mother.
