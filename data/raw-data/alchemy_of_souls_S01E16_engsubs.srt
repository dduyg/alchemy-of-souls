1
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:37,294
What if I do not mind dying?

2
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,418
Then can I hold onto it
and keep loving you?

3
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,996
I told you that
I am willing to risk it all

4
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:47,762
and that we are in this together.

5
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,220
I will keep going no matter what.

6
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:55,761
So you should do the same
and stick to your confession.

7
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,308
Keep loving me to death.

8
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,948
Mu-deok, you should not glare like that.

9
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:19,254
Nobody would believe your words
if you glare at me like that.

10
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,963
Then tell me, Young Master.

11
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,000
How should I look to convince people
that I love you to death?

12
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:28,837
Well, first of allâ€¦

13
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,466
Glaring at me like that
will definitely not do.

14
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,140
They say one's eyes would be
brimming with sweetness.

15
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:39,766
I guess that is not possible.

16
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:42,935
So why did you say you love me to death?

17
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:46,309
You should have said
you were mildly attracted to me instead.

18
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,321
Say that I do my best
to look at you with sweetness

19
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:52,531
and keep loving you to death.

20
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,702
What happens after that?

21
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,071
After?

22
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:59,037
Should I keep loving you blindly

23
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,909
while Maidservant Kim
desperately tries to marry you off?

24
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:06,167
What would happen to me then?

25
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:09,995
Do not worry.
I have no intention of marrying for now.

26
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:11,758
"No intention," my foot.

27
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,680
Is that not why you refused
to drink chaste herb tea?

28
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:20,223
So what you are asking me is

29
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:23,306
a promise of some sort?

30
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,273
If I am to stay in love with you,

31
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:28,817
I need to be certain that you are mine.

32
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:35,027
Let us not rush into things.

33
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,033
So you refuse.

34
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,829
Why is everything so dramatic with you?

35
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,450
I am just saying that
we cannot rush things right now.

36
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:46,538
I have to discuss it
with Maidservant Kim too.

37
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:47,634
Good grief.

38
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:49,383
Never mind then.

39
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:52,171
"Eyes brimming with sweetness," my foot.

40
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,835
I will just glare at you like a dog.

41
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:56,014
A dog?

42
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:57,966
That is right.

43
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:01,512
I forgot to tell you something important.

44
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,930
It was that dog.

45
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,057
What are you talking about?

46
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:09,364
The dog that was with Master Lee
at Danhyanggok. Do you remember?

47
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,228
Sapsali?

48
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,646
Yes.

49
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:15,026
That dog was Gwigu.

50
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:22,662
Master Lee knew that you were
a soul shifter from the beginning.

51
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:23,914
Perhaps,

52
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,619
he even knows you are Naksu.

53
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:43,768
What brings the leader of Jinyowon
to Songrim at this hour?

54
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,980
She must be here for you.

55
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:53,111
I heard that

56
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:56,651
you took Gwigu, a relic of Jinyowon,
to the palace today.

57
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,526
It was to find traces
of sorcery at the palace.

58
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:04,124
I warned you not to get Jinyowon involved
in any more soul shifter cases.

59
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,372
Why is Songrim using Jinyowon at will?

60
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,575
Mage families under the Unanimous Assembly

61
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,337
must strive to stop sorcery.

62
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:16,208
If Songrim is striving to do just that,
Jinyowon should offer their assistance.

63
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,468
Do you not think so?

64
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:21,509
So you mean you will use us again.

65
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,100
Then I will take Gwigu.

66
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,559
Hand it over to me.

67
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:31,979
Or should I look for it myself?

68
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,190
Gwigu is right here.

69
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,827
Gwigu was a relic created
by Master Seo Gyeong.

70
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,502
Therefore, it also belongs to Songrim.

71
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,870
Why would Jinyowon's relic
also belong to Songrim?

72
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,588
Are you saying Jinyowon is
some kind of storehouse for Songrim?

73
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,420
That is not what he meant.

74
00:04:57,505 --> 00:05:01,085
You boldly assume everything
in Jinyowon is yours to take.

75
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:03,545
You take things without asking
and never return them.

76
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,927
That must be
how the people of Songrim are.

77
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:12,061
You said something similar before.

78
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:17,981
That a mage of Songrim had taken
something from Jinyowon.

79
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,951
Who was that mage?

80
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,919
He is right before my eyes.

81
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:44,586
The one who snuck into Jinyowon

82
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,347
and stole Gwigu.

83
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:51,730
How dare you call Master Lee a thief!

84
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:54,689
What else do you call someone who steals?

85
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:57,694
Mother, please.

86
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:01,864
It was Master Lee who moved Gwigu
from the broken pottery

87
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,654
into the body of that dog.

88
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,568
It was Songrim that broke the pottery.

89
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:06,816
How dare you!

90
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,263
It is dead, Master.

91
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,732
I was protecting my daughter.

92
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:19,190
Master Lee, did you command
Gwigu to attack us?

93
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,862
Gwigu attacked because it sensed sorcery.

94
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,317
Then that means

95
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,117
that the young lady had traces of sorcery.

96
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,002
It must have sensed the sorcery
of the worm that sucked her blood.

97
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,048
Young Lady Jin.

98
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,142
Have you ever

99
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,600
used sorcery?

100
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:03,023
Sorcery? That is preposterous!

101
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,357
If not,

102
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,782
why would Gwigu have attacked her?

103
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:10,411
Songrim must be trying
to frame my daughter.

104
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,990
Please stop!

105
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,408
Master Lee is right.

106
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,207
A while ago,

107
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:23,539
I did use sorcery.

108
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:33,394
But it was not meant to hurt anyone.

109
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:43,612
It is quite popular these days.

110
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:48,572
It is a Lovers' Charm.
It helps grant one's love.

111
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,544
I think it was because of that.

112
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:07,133
It seems our daughter has
caused a misunderstanding.

113
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,303
Our apologies.

114
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:35,871
You stayed alive in the body of this dog

115
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,494
but now you are gone.

116
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,673
Gwigu has now completely vanished.

117
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,085
What do I do?

118
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:58,564
Is it my fault that Gwigu died?

119
00:09:58,639 --> 00:09:59,519
Cho-yeon!

120
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,636
How dare you disgrace Jinyowon?

121
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,593
Gwigu is dead?

122
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,553
Yes.

123
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,470
Master Lee said he will bury it
in the daylight tomorrow.

124
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,724
So this dog was Gwigu.

125
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:43,144
It must have known that
I was a soul shifter from the beginning.

126
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:46,194
But it never barked at me.

127
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:50,608
Was it covering for me too?

128
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,857
Even though it is dead, it is still Gwigu.

129
00:10:57,865 --> 00:11:00,575
There might still be traces of its powers.
Do not touch it.

130
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,336
Did the people from Jinyowon leave?

131
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,050
They are discussing
another issue right now.

132
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:14,631
Another issue?

133
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,841
It turns out Dang-gu and Cho-yeon

134
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,095
were lovers.

135
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,596
-What?
-What?

136
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,940
I was the one who destroyed
a relic of Jinyowon

137
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,898
so Songrim is not at fault.

138
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,399
We shall now leave.

139
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,650
-Let us go.
-Yes.

140
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:34,994
Lady Jin.

141
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,319
Have some tea before you leave.

142
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:40,115
We should clear misunderstandings
and make meaningful bonds.

143
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:41,953
Make bonds?

144
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,994
These two are in love.

145
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,458
The charm that you took out before

146
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,169
was for Dang-gu, right?

147
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,804
Yes. I am the cause of all of this.

148
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,130
Cho-yeon did not do anything wrong.

149
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,215
Be quiet.

150
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,554
I found out recently too.

151
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,427
He was talking nonsense

152
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:06,274
about how they will be together
when your late daughter returns

153
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,100
so I reprimanded him.

154
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:11,225
My late daughter?
Bu-yeon is alive and we will find her.

155
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,320
Do you really believe
Jin Mu will find her?

156
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:18,823
You are being fooled by him.

157
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,775
Did Jin Mu give you the idea
to search all over Songrim

158
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,696
looking for Gwigu at this hour?

159
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:26,004
I told you not to meddle in our affairs.

160
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,419
Now, let us not fight.

161
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:32,628
It would be wonderful news
to find Bu-yeon.

162
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:36,260
Lady Jin does not want to
make enemies with Songrim either.

163
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:40,759
Let us be cordial as we were before.

164
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,303
Who knows?

165
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:46,016
Cho-yeon and Dang-gu
may unite the two families.

166
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,428
I respectfully decline.

167
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:50,226
Cho-yeon will have a better suitor.

168
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:55,649
Who is better than
the Park family of Songrim?

169
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,283
A daughter of the Jin family

170
00:12:57,359 --> 00:13:00,109
is good enough to be
the bride of the Crown Prince.

171
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:02,615
Mother.

172
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:04,278
What are you saying?

173
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:06,452
I do not want to.

174
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:09,334
The Crown Prince is unkind.

175
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:11,873
-I do not like him.
-Cho-yeon.

176
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,501
I wish to marry the one I love.

177
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:16,875
Yes.

178
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,415
I am the one she loves.

179
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:20,547
Dang-gu!

180
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,642
We will talk at home.

181
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,728
Let go of his hand and follow me.

182
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:36,523
Let her go for now.

183
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,437
Let go of her hand so she can leave.

184
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:41,275
Let go of his hand.

185
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,452
Let go!

186
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,580
Cho-yeon.

187
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,575
If you wish to be so disobedient,
do not bother coming home.

188
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,560
I think it is best that we leave.

189
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,886
Will you not come home with us?

190
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,436
I will not obey Mother this time.

191
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,228
Please understand, Father.

192
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:22,403
I will send word
when your mother's anger subsides.

193
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:25,993
Please take care of her for a while.

194
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,660
I will.

195
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:39,884
Uncle, I apologize for the trouble.

196
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,552
But I will protect my lady.

197
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,460
Get out!

198
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:55,853
Where should we go now?

199
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,230
I do not know.

200
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,775
Since he told us to leave,

201
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,702
we could go to an inn and getâ€¦

202
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,235
-Get a room?
-Sorry?

203
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,790
That is not what I meant!

204
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:16,711
Not one room,
but separate rooms of course.

205
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,340
I do not like inns.

206
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:27,009
There is nowhere else to go for now.

207
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,592
And it is getting coldâ€¦

208
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:30,385
It is coldâ€¦

209
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,180
Where can we go?

210
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,636
Young Master Park!

211
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:40,401
They said Young Master Jang was released,
but he is not in his room.

212
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:41,821
Have you seen him?

213
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,737
Is there something wrong?

214
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,947
-Maidservant Kimâ€¦
-What?

215
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,036
Maidservant Kim.

216
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,040
Please let go, Young Master Park.

217
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,330
Young Lady Jin? What is going on?

218
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,037
Maidservant Kimâ€¦

219
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,587
Gwigu, which caused mayhem at the palace,

220
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:08,382
was destroyed by Lady Jin
as she was trying to retrieve it.

221
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,217
Gwigu was destroyed?

222
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,182
Why would she destroy something
that detects sorcery?

223
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:14,642
Detecting sorcery was just an excuse.

224
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:17,693
It was a relic that Songrim used
to threaten the royal family.

225
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:19,898
Jin Mu is right.

226
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,519
Songrim wanted to show off
that they were more powerful than us.

227
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,687
Under the guise of rooting out sorcery,

228
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:29,277
Songrim can mobilize
the mages of the Unanimous Assembly

229
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,323
and dethrone the king.

230
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:34,282
Is that why they mentioned
the King's Star?

231
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:37,408
To warn me that they could dethrone me?

232
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:41,212
The reason Master Lee mentioned
the King's Star was to explain

233
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:44,841
that someone like Master Seo Gyeong
will come to save us from troubled times.

234
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,800
It was not to threaten us.

235
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,180
What if the one that saves us
wants to rule us as well?

236
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,431
Do you think you can stop him?

237
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,603
Gwanju Jang Gang of Cheonbugwan

238
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,391
predicted that
the King's Star will appear.

239
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,475
Master Lee said that as well.

240
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,898
Does Songrim know this too?

241
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:15,911
He tried to sire a son with the energy of
the King's Star from his many concubines.

242
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,503
Now he is trying to find one in Songrim.

243
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,578
It is natural
for the King to be so threatened.

244
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,250
To the royal household of Go,

245
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:27,464
the existence of the King's Star
could signal treason.

246
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:35,675
"Treason"?

247
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:39,425
People of Daeho do believe in
and worship the heavens,

248
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,770
but a centuries-old monarchy
would not crumble so easily.

249
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:45,523
It is preposterous to think
that one can become king

250
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:46,936
because of some constellation.

251
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,744
If he is from Songrim, it is possible.

252
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,913
Master Seo Gyeong of Songrim
saved the world 200 years ago.

253
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:58,740
He is still revered within Daeho.

254
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,874
If someone was born under the King's Star
like Master Seo Gyeong,

255
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:07,626
it could make a convincing reason
to become a King.

256
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,045
So you think

257
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:15,085
the King's worries may come true?

258
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,058
Do not be concerned.

259
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:24,562
As long as I am here,
that will never happen.

260
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:30,569
Very well.

261
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:35,201
I will not be foolish like my father
and live under constant fear.

262
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,905
When I brought Gwigu to the palace,

263
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,583
I could see that you were right.

264
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:47,915
The Queen is on Jin Mu's side.

265
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:51,961
But we cannot provoke
the royal family just yet.

266
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,377
If Songrim tries
to take on the royal family,

267
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:57,546
Jin Mu will surely use
the circumstances of Uk's birth

268
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,966
and turn him into
the enemy of the royal family.

269
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:03,682
Then Songrim will become
an enemy of the royal family as well

270
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:05,347
for taking him in.

271
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,768
We need Jang Gang.

272
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,526
Jang Gang knows the truth.

273
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,571
He must know Jin Mu's weakness as well.

274
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:19,033
How can you find someone
who has been wandering for decades?

275
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:22,116
We will have to wait
until he returns of his own accord.

276
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:27,082
The rumors about soul shifters
have spread throughout Daeho Fortress.

277
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,246
If he hears the rumors, he will return,

278
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:35,165
fearing for Songrim and for his son.

279
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,671
I came because I was summoned.

280
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,256
Where is Master Lee?

281
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:21,386
He left for Danhyanggok at dawn

282
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,347
to bury Sapsali.

283
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:24,851
What?

284
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:28,392
He is not here? Was it not Master Lee
who summoned me?

285
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,897
He did summon you.

286
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:33,478
He told me to give this to you.

287
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:40,453
This is the assassin Naksu's sword
that he retrieved from the Crown Prince.

288
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:44,115
He said you are the only one
who can keep this sword

289
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,911
so he told me to give it to you.

290
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,500
He just left me this sword?

291
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,834
Did he not say anything else
before leaving?

292
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:55,087
He did not take you in as his pupil,

293
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:58,380
so I do not understand
why he is treating you fondly.

294
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:00,682
You will not even practice chastity.

295
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:06,216
I heard from Park Jin that
you are head over heels for a woman.

296
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,558
If you were in love with Mu-deok,

297
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,392
why did you lead on my Yun-ok?

298
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:14,265
-I never led her on.
-Did you not?

299
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,686
You charmed Yun-ok.

300
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,654
How did you manage to charm Master Lee?

301
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,485
I did not do anything.

302
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,620
Just because someone is being good to me,

303
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,779
does not mean I charmed them.

304
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:30,117
Be mindful of Yun-ok from now on

305
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,825
and be respectful to Master Lee.

306
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:32,955
Yes.

307
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:36,631
Master Lee is not close-minded
like other masters at Songrim.

308
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:39,882
He seems to be open-minded and gracious.

309
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,545
I respect him.

310
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:45,514
You have no idea how strict he can be.

311
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:50,600
He is merciless towards those who stray.

312
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:53,444
So you must always be careful.

313
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,650
Take it and be off.

314
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:02,775
I forgot.

315
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,453
I almost got in trouble again.

316
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:06,581
I was told to give you this message

317
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:09,198
when I gave you Naksu's sword.

318
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:23,296
Why would he give you my sword?

319
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:26,094
Because I have you,

320
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,675
I should have your sword too.

321
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:32,638
Anyway, this means
he will continue to turn a blind eye.

322
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,056
That is good.

323
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:42,284
I was told to give you this message.

324
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:49,485
Jang Uk must keep that sword safe.

325
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:53,456
If anyone tries to use the sword,
they must be killed.

326
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:57,422
If he fails to do so,

327
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:01,509
he will die as well.

328
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:08,684
It was a warning that he will kill us
if Mu-deok ever uses the sword

329
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:11,006
as the assassin, Naksu.

330
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,730
The sword feels strange,
even though it is mine.

331
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:21,612
He must have let me live
because he knows I cannot use it.

332
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:25,282
It means you will be safe as Mu-deok.

333
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:28,371
If I become Naksu, I will be in danger.

334
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:31,657
Once I find the ice stone
and regain my energy,

335
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:34,449
I will also gain many enemies.

336
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:37,831
What happens to me then

337
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:39,958
will have nothing to do with you.

338
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:41,003
Why?

339
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:43,881
Because we will no longer be
master and pupil?

340
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:46,304
You will no longer
have a reason to protect me.

341
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,343
Nor will I have a reason
to go easy on you.

342
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:52,139
That was our promise from the start.

343
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,403
Then promise me one more thing.

344
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,397
Out of duty and loyalty,

345
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:08,534
and also out of the so-called love,
you can grant me one more wish.

346
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:11,873
Fine. What is it?

347
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:14,116
When you regain your energy

348
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:17,294
and if you must draw
and point that sword at someone,

349
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:20,133
point it at me before at anyone else.

350
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,210
If you stab me,

351
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:29,628
then I will die as the one
who released the assassin.

352
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:34,718
If you withdraw your sword,

353
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,770
I will make you another promise.

354
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,399
Something along the lines of the promise

355
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:45,779
you wanted to hear
from me about our future.

356
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:57,541
I will look for the ice stone
so you do not run wild

357
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:00,535
because I promised to do so.

358
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:13,428
The runaway couple

359
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:15,931
is staying at my house.

360
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:20,016
Dang-gu is there?

361
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:26,692
Why did you take them in?

362
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:27,935
If not,

363
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,856
should I have left them to go into town

364
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:33,365
to build a lover's nest
and become the talk of the town?

365
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:36,618
I ask you to be discrete

366
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:39,791
and take good care of them.

367
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:42,291
They are a sweet couple.

368
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,134
Why are you so against it?

369
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,459
They cannot marry.

370
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:48,344
So you kicked them out?

371
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,762
My lord, you must stop
this habit of yours.

372
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:55,353
You held Mu-deok and Young Master Jang
for no reason the other night.

373
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:57,638
You must become more tolerant as you age.

374
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,353
Such a shameâ€¦

375
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:03,354
I like Mu-deok a lot.

376
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:06,356
I like Young Master Jang very much.

377
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,152
Maidservant Kim.

378
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,360
What would you do

379
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:15,527
if Uk falls in love
with a woman he should not,

380
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,159
like Dang-gu?

381
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,242
Would you be tolerant?

382
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:27,340
Whoever Young Master Jang loves
is fine with me.

383
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,169
-Is that right?
-Of course.

384
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,130
I am sure you will.

385
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,838
I know that you care about

386
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:38,887
birth, appearance, age, and much more.

387
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,562
The heart is the most important.

388
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:44,061
If you are in love,
appearances do not matter.

389
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:47,191
So what if she is not that beautiful,

390
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,652
or if they have a great age difference?

391
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:59,332
Is that how you feel too?

392
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:01,623
Is it?

393
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:02,873
Pardon?

394
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:09,709
Anyone who is not as handsome as Jang Gang

395
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:12,258
and is much older

396
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:15,839
would still have a chance

397
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:18,724
if your heart is moved?

398
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:21,602
Wellâ€¦

399
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:26,558
If my heart is moved,

400
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:31,151
he would seem more handsome

401
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:32,532
and younger in my eyes.

402
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:48,038
I see, Maidservant Kim.

403
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,594
I understand what you mean.

404
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:13,191
Goodness, he was quite straightforward
when he asked how I felt about him.

405
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:16,819
What does he mean by not being handsome?

406
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:18,913
And he is only two years older than me.

407
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:23,785
He worries for no reason.

408
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:38,551
How can she say she likes Master Lee

409
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:40,393
so easily in front of me?

410
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:46,141
Is he handsome?

411
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:51,479
He is more than
a hundred years older than her.

412
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:03,118
Dang-guâ€¦

413
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:05,703
You little brat!

414
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:10,827
Right now,

415
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:15,958
I wish I could have
the wine hidden in Uncle's room

416
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,380
instead of tea.

417
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:20,925
What? You already have regrets?

418
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:22,549
No way.

419
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:26,559
I believed I could give it all up.

420
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:29,389
That is why I took her hand that day.

421
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:34,944
I did not know
he would grab my hand so suddenly.

422
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:38,610
I was just upset that
they were talking about the Crown Prince.

423
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:41,113
All I said was that
I do not like the Crown Prince.

424
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:44,118
But he suddenly grabbed my hand
and said he loved me.

425
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,449
Move over a bit.

426
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:50,655
I could not just let go of his hand.

427
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:52,827
I was simply swept up in the moment.

428
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,420
I had no intention to run away from home.

429
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,706
How long will you be here?

430
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:03,757
I was told to serve you two
while you are here.

431
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:07,472
I have no idea.

432
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:09,675
I do not wish to stay here for long.

433
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:13,808
If I say we should go back home,

434
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:16,055
I would seem irresponsible, right?

435
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:19,067
If I say I want to go home,
it would break his heart, right?

436
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:21,779
-What do I do?
-What do I do?

437
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,028
This is for the best.

438
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:27,204
Serving Young Lady Jin here

439
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:29,663
is better than
running into Park Jin at Songrim.

440
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:34,254
If So-i is responsible
for the murder case you are embroiled in,

441
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:36,004
then it is dangerous.

442
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:39,804
You may not know her,
but she knows who Mu-deok is.

443
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:44,684
Why is So-i going around killing people?

444
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,715
If the blind girl
these men were picking on

445
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,677
is the same girl the broker knew as So-i,

446
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,944
then she probably
could not have killed them herself.

447
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,519
She must have someone helping her.

448
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:59,824
If the authorities take these bodies,
they will catch the murderer.

449
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,278
Mu-deok would know about So-i.

450
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,610
We should send her
to help with the investigation.

451
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,532
She will not recognize So-i.

452
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:10,075
She is not the same Mu-deok
who lived in Sari Village.

453
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,079
She will be falsely accused and suffer.

454
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:16,042
I will ask her myself if necessary.

455
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:26,381
I do not think you need to step up.
Yul seems to be on top of it.

456
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:36,598
We will be in trouble if
the Assistant Gwanju hears you are out.

457
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:39,863
Everyone who recognizes me
has been killed.

458
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:42,189
I would have to walk outside
even after I get into Jinyowon.

459
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:44,395
I should practice
walking like a blind person.

460
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:46,988
You should buy what you want.

461
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,991
I gave you quite a bit of money.

462
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:52,123
Let us go back after a while.

463
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:54,703
Wait a minute.

464
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,830
Why are you using an umbrella
instead of a cane?

465
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,004
Do not touch it.

466
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:04,384
I prefer using this.

467
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:19,231
You did help prove my innocence.

468
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:21,612
I hope you will be comfortable
while you are here.

469
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:23,939
Does the Jang family always eat like this?

470
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:26,403
This is too greasy.

471
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:32,659
Yes, Young Lady.
I will prepare a different meal.

472
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:43,668
This is too salty!

473
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:48,049
-It is not salty.
-It is salty.

474
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,342
I get bloated when I eat salty foods.

475
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,314
Yes, Young Lady.

476
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,430
This is too hard.

477
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,348
This is too sweet.

478
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:02,862
What is this?

479
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:05,937
I am so worried I lost my appetite.

480
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:11,196
Why is she acting exactly like Uk?

481
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:13,196
I have no appetite.

482
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:14,782
Do you have something to drink?

483
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:16,447
Like cinnamon punch or rice punch?

484
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:24,538
They are perfect for each other.
Why call off the wedding?

485
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:28,127
If they got married,
one of them would have died in a fight.

486
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:34,097
Mu-deok, the rice punch isâ€¦

487
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,308
Is it sweet? And too cold?

488
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:39,061
Rice punch is supposed to be like that.

489
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:41,437
Why are you raising your voice?

490
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,059
Are you tired of serving me?

491
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:46,108
Then would you say you were easy to serve?

492
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,776
I get irritable when I am anxious.

493
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,822
It is uncomfortable not being at home.

494
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:54,695
Then go home.

495
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:58,492
No. I am too scared.

496
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:00,538
Mother is very angry with me.

497
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,420
Even for a daughter, you are a handful.

498
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:07,421
I was never her favorite.

499
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,758
My sister was her pride and joy.

500
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:14,643
Even though she was blind,

501
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,719
she could see energy and handle relics.

502
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:19,564
Even at a young age, her abilities
were as powerful as my mother's.

503
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,480
Well, I heard that the Jin family members

504
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,350
are born with more divine powers
than spell-related powers.

505
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:28,108
You saw me handle Gwigu, right?

506
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:30,315
It is like that.

507
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,201
A really powerful priestess

508
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:35,698
can control people's souls
and trap them to be helpless.

509
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,946
-Trap the soul?
-Yes.

510
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:41,075
If the priestess traps their powers,

511
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:44,672
even the most powerful mage is helpless.

512
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:49,004
I heard there are shamans

513
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:51,257
who can erase or change
memories of a soul.

514
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:54,049
A Jinyowon priestess is
in a different league.

515
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:57,263
How did such an amazing girl like her die?

516
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:00,345
Because she is that great.

517
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:04,058
She is definitely alive.

518
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,515
We will see her again.

519
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,198
If she is alive

520
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:17,565
I am sure you will.

521
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:29,375
Uncle looked into Mu-deok.

522
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:32,881
He asked the broker about her.
Did you know about that?

523
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:35,506
Yes. I heard from her.

524
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,930
He has become suspicious
because of the soul shifter incident.

525
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:41,433
You are right.

526
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:45,814
If there are soul shifters in the palace,
Songrim may have them too.

527
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:50,516
Why is the cast-out successor of Songrim
worrying about such a thing?

528
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:54,736
-I am not totally cast out.
-He is already regretting it.

529
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:55,649
Hey.

530
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:58,066
You were so confident yesterday.

531
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:02,028
Uk is the one who always gets kicked out.

532
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:03,538
What am I doing here?

533
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:05,749
You will get used to it.

534
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:09,040
It is quite miserable the first time.

535
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,588
Only Yul would have no idea how we feel.

536
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,840
What do you mean?

537
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:15,011
Yul has been kicked out too.

538
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:16,169
No way.

539
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:19,053
Do you remember the time
that I broke the gold-plated inkstone

540
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,635
and we all lied together?

541
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:29,146
Uncle will get so mad at me.

542
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:30,609
Let us hide it.

543
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:33,654
We will bury it
and pretend to know nothing about it.

544
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,443
That is not right.

545
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,567
We must tell the truth
and ask for forgiveness.

546
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:41,744
Then Dang-gu will get in
a lot of trouble with the leader.

547
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:46,785
I cannot tell a lie.

548
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:50,081
It is all right, Dang-gu.

549
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,588
I am sure there is a way.

550
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:58,465
Eventually the three of us
agreed to cover it up.

551
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:00,969
But Yul became ill afterward.

552
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:04,512
I think Yul is very ill.

553
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:05,807
I think so.

554
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:12,055
My goodness,
why is Yul so sick? What is wrong?

555
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:16,147
I heard he cannot eat or sleep well.

556
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,324
What is wrong?

557
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:21,744
Yul had never done anything wrong.

558
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:24,242
He got sick worrying we would get caught.

559
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:28,446
We ended up confessing
because we thought Yul would die.

560
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:30,667
We were all kicked out together.

561
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:34,038
I got kicked out so many times
so I do not remember everything.

562
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:37,666
But I doubt that Yul was sick
because he was afraid of being caught.

563
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,800
He suffered because he knew
what he was doing was wrong,

564
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:45,638
and that fact was hard for him to endure.

565
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:52,136
He is someone who gets lost
if he is caught off guard.

566
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:56,824
He must have been worried
and scared to do something

567
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,108
he knew was wrong

568
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:02,195
just to protect his friends.

569
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:09,786
Yes. I remember it clearly.

570
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,542
I suffered quite a bit.

571
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,544
To punish oneself more harshly

572
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:18,496
than others would.

573
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:20,837
Is it some sort of
a heightened state of morality?

574
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:24,299
Gosh, you were already there
at that young age?

575
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:25,425
That is incredible.

576
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:29,846
Can you imagine what I felt,
burying a broken inkstone

577
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:31,352
with my immature friends?

578
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:35,185
We could not even bury it well.
We were soon caught.

579
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:36,561
-What?
-What?

580
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:39,357
We were caught? You said we confessed.

581
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:41,942
Dang-gu is remembering it wrong.

582
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:43,448
We did not confess to it.

583
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:47,908
Sang-ho found the half-buried inkstone.
That is how we were caught.

584
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:49,664
Is that right?

585
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:51,754
I must have romanticized the memory.

586
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:55,422
I thought we did the honorable thing.

587
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,079
How embarrassingâ€¦

588
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,998
What are you embarrassed about?

589
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:02,207
You are currently a runaway.

590
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:05,008
Who will be the next leader
instead of Dang-gu?

591
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,180
Will it be Sang-ho?

592
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:08,641
Is that right?

593
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:11,021
I should get on his good side.

594
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:14,234
You two cannot discard me like this.

595
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,230
You should take my side like before.

596
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:18,192
Come on, Uk.

597
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,822
I will not be much help to you.

598
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:24,610
-Hey, Yul.
-I am not good with words.

599
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:26,322
Especially about loveâ€¦

600
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,424
Of course you two are on my side.

601
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:57,557
Yul, do you not sleep well these days?

602
00:39:57,645 --> 00:40:00,645
Drink as much as you want today

603
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,731
and get a good night's sleep.

604
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,068
You have trouble sleeping?

605
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:07,695
No.

606
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,370
I saw you wandering around until late.

607
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:11,238
You usually go to bed like clockwork.

608
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:14,615
Are you concerned about
what is happening at Seoho Fortress?

609
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:24,379
I just slashed a soul shifter.

610
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,836
It is our duty to protect this world

611
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,343
from such monsters.

612
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:33,891
Even though it is dead, it is still Gwigu.

613
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,852
There might still be traces of its powers.

614
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,443
Do not touch it.

615
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:46,607
You are feigning ignorance, right?

616
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:52,032
Like the time we buried the inkstone.

617
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:56,367
It must be tough for you.

618
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:16,807
If I regain my energy and draw that sword,

619
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:22,901
will I be able to slash
anyone relentlessly like before?

620
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:29,453
Is that the assassin's sword?

621
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,320
Why did Young Master bring it again?

622
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:37,825
I am terrified of that sword.

623
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:40,963
It feels ominous. I do not want it nearby.

624
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:46,344
The guests are all asleep. Go to bed.

625
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:48,634
Maybe we need to have a charm written.

626
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:00,177
Terrifyingâ€¦

627
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,439
and ominous.

628
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:36,892
Eunuch Kim,
who caused trouble at Cheonbugwan,

629
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,721
is not beside the Queen today as well.

630
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:41,062
Did you look into it?

631
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:44,401
They say he is ill and is resting,
but no one seems to know where he is.

632
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:48,398
Find out as much as you can about him.

633
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:49,982
Find out when he came to the palace,

634
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:53,107
when he started serving the Queen,
and if there is anything odd about him.

635
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:55,356
Be discrete.

636
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:56,993
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

637
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:06,498
Do you remember what Eunuch Kim said
when we saw him at Cheonbugwan?

638
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,922
Did that wench Shaman Choi

639
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,549
tell you to kill me?

640
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:15,801
Shaman Choiâ€¦

641
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:18,974
She must be superior to Jin Mu
to have given him orders.

642
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:21,724
It must be the Queen.

643
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:24,517
Just as Mu-deok's true identity is Naksu.

644
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,272
Could the true identity of the Queen

645
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:29,023
be Shaman Choi?

646
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:29,976
That is probably right.

647
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,280
But only if the Queen is a soul shifter.

648
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:39,332
There was nothing to suspect
that the Queen is a soul shifter.

649
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:42,408
I checked her core of energy
as I was examining her,

650
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:45,414
but she was a normal person
without extraordinary energy.

651
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:52,128
She could have appeared so
if she had the ice stone.

652
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:57,676
The Queen is the younger sister
of General Seo.

653
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,180
She is Yul's aunt.

654
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:02,851
She is not related to the Heo family,
but she is a member of the Seo family.

655
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:04,391
If her soul has been shifted,

656
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:09,232
the soul in her body is someone else.

657
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:12,483
Is the Queen's soul dead?

658
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,527
That is not possible.

659
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:17,820
Each member of the Seo Family
has a Lantern of Life.

660
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:22,738
Because they guard the Seoho Fortress
near the border and go to battle often,

661
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:26,656
they each have a lantern that is lit
by the energy of their soul

662
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:28,457
so they know who is alive and dead.

663
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:31,793
If the Queen passed away,

664
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:34,844
they would know immediately because
her Lantern of Life would have gone off.

665
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:38,969
Yes, I remember the Lantern of Life.

666
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:43,101
Her soul would have been
kept alive in another body.

667
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:49,767
Like Master Kang of Daegangtongun
who is lying in Sejukwon right now.

668
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:57,070
Are you certain
that the Queen is a soul shifter?

669
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:00,324
If we can know for sure,

670
00:45:01,323 --> 00:45:04,743
that would mean
we found Jin Mu's greatest weakness.

671
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:10,206
Songrim is suspecting me

672
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:13,250
and they will try
to prove the Queen is a soul shifter.

673
00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:14,875
What is there to worry about?

674
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:19,221
We already have a body
for her soul to be transferred to.

675
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:28,350
Can you get her into Jinyowon
without a problem?

676
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:31,311
I will bring her to Jinyowon today.

677
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:34,229
If everything goes to plan,

678
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:37,355
Jinyowon will get their lost daughter back

679
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:40,526
and there will be a funeral at the palace.

680
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:45,783
Because the Queen will have passed away.

681
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:53,125
What should we do with my old body
that the Queen's soul is occupying?

682
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:58,092
We shall take care of it
since we no longer need it alive.

683
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:43,842
Your Highness,
I am here instead of Eunuch Kim today.

684
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:53,846
What a pity.

685
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:58,566
It would be better for you
to let go of your mind.

686
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:22,339
This must be Gaema Village.

687
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:25,221
You are looking for a shaman?

688
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,300
Yes.

689
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:29,005
Then try Gaema Village.

690
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:32,926
All kinds of shamans gather there.

691
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:36,097
I know the oldest shaman there.

692
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:39,477
If you are looking for someone, ask him.

693
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:44,281
-Fire Priestess is really--
-No thank you.

694
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:46,411
-Wait.
-Goodness.

695
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:50,488
Excuse me, do you know
where Shaman Bong's house is?

696
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:51,906
Shaman Bong?

697
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:54,254
He does not have powers anymore.

698
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:55,999
You should go to
the Fire Priestess instead.

699
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:58,881
-I will take you there.
-No, I am looking for Shaman Bong.

700
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:01,999
-I told you, he is not good.
-No, it has to be Shaman Bong.

701
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:03,921
Thank you.

702
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:18,019
Where am I?

703
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:20,652
All of the streets look the same.

704
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:27,361
I never said
I wanted to see the Fire Priestess.

705
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:30,196
You still have to pay
if you had your fortune read.

706
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:32,702
-Where are you going?
-Hey, do not touch me.

707
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:35,451
She did not get a single thing right.
Why should I pay?

708
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:43,628
Did you go and see Shaman Bong?

709
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:45,012
He is bad, is he not?

710
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:48,048
The Fire Priestess is the real deal.
Am I right?

711
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:49,763
"Fire Priestess," my foot.

712
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:50,933
Come on.

713
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:54,770
My goodnessâ€¦

714
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:58,438
Did you come to get your fortune read?

715
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:01,404
How about you?
Did you come for an exorcism?

716
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:04,822
What did Fire Priestess say
to make you so angry?

717
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:08,902
She said I have no luck in government
and I should get into business.

718
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:10,357
I am the Crown Prince.

719
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:13,533
What did Shaman Bong say to you?

720
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:15,947
I am on my way to see him.
I have many questions for him.

721
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:19,787
Jang Uk.

722
00:49:22,959 --> 00:49:25,169
Are you looking for Eunuch Kim too?

723
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:30,343
Why are you looking for him here?

724
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:37,394
He disappeared from the palace
since that day at Cheonbugwan.

725
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:40,185
His traces led me here.

726
00:49:40,268 --> 00:49:43,608
So you came here alone without any guards?

727
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:47,229
I do not want anyone to know

728
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:49,903
that I am suspecting them.

729
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:54,988
So you agree that
Eunuch Kim is a soul shifter

730
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:58,946
and that the Queen is being
suspicious by trying to cover it up?

731
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:01,962
That is right.

732
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:05,126
Why are you here?
What are you looking for?

733
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:08,634
I think there are overlaps in
what we are looking for.

734
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:09,884
Shall we exchange information?

735
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:12,006
Share one piece of information each?

736
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:14,801
Fine. You go first.

737
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:16,806
If I tell you first,

738
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:19,598
you will not share yours,
saying, "I am the Crown Prince."

739
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:20,643
How did you know that?

740
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:23,561
Fine.

741
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:28,818
While I was searching for Eunuch Kim,
I found something strange.

742
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,450
It seems he left the palace every month
to go somewhere.

743
00:50:32,237 --> 00:50:34,567
The place he visited every month
was Gaema Village.

744
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:37,525
I am looking for Shaman Choi.

745
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:39,038
Who is that?

746
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,579
That is for the next time.
Now if you excuse meâ€¦

747
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:43,624
Wait.

748
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:47,838
What am I supposed to glean
from that kind of information?

749
00:50:47,919 --> 00:50:49,669
I do not have much information yet.

750
00:50:52,507 --> 00:50:55,507
-Why are you following me?
-To meet Shaman Bong.

751
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:57,224
We do not have to go together.

752
00:50:57,304 --> 00:51:00,644
I can go afterward
and get him to tell me what he told you.

753
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:02,428
I am the Crown Prince.

754
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:10,901
-I do not know where he is.
-You do know.

755
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:12,444
I really have no idea.

756
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:20,413
I have met your uncle and your mother.

757
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:22,294
What did she say?

758
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:24,750
Is she still very angry at me?

759
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:27,674
Will he really cast me out?

760
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:33,220
They said they will forgive you
if you submit a signed letter.

761
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:36,128
A signed letter swearing
never to see each other again.

762
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:40,353
Here you go.

763
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,059
The words are already written

764
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:46,352
so all you have to do is sign each copy

765
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:48,226
and you will be able to return home.

766
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:50,522
You can discuss it
before making your decision.

767
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:55,318
As for me, I am willing to provide
food and shelter for a while

768
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:58,413
if you insist on staying together.

769
00:51:58,490 --> 00:51:59,320
Please excuse me.

770
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:11,962
Cho-yeonâ€¦

771
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:18,178
To tell you the truth,

772
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:23,273
I slightly regretted it.

773
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:28,097
I was scared that I may have acted

774
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:32,072
rather impulsively.

775
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:37,111
Butâ€¦

776
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:45,655
the thought of never seeing you againâ€¦

777
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:50,457
I do not care about anything else.

778
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:54,212
I cannot sign this letter.

779
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:55,956
I cannot live without seeing you.

780
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:00,388
JIN CHO-YEON OF JINYOWON SWEARS NEVER
TO SEE PARK DANG-GU OF SONGRIM AGAIN

781
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:03,431
I was also annoyed at first.

782
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:08,314
But I want to keep seeing you.

783
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:46,639
The negotiation is off.

784
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:49,523
Set the table, Mu-deok.

785
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:57,896
Have some fish.

786
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:05,914
Have some meat as well.

787
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:22,053
Are you two really going to stay here?

788
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:23,343
Yes.

789
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:27,506
We are going to go home
and bring our belongings.

790
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:30,347
So you will build
your honeymoon nest here?

791
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:34,646
It is not like that,

792
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:36,609
but we at least need a change of clothes.

793
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:39,400
Could you go with her
and carry her luggage back?

794
00:54:50,203 --> 00:54:51,913
Did you throw away the paper
that was here?

795
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:53,327
I was about to throw them out.

796
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:01,630
JIN CHO-YEON OF JINYOWON SWEARS NEVER
TO SEE PARK DANG-GU OF SONGRIM AGAIN

797
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:03,255
I need to think it over.

798
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:07,677
If I pack up and leave,
I really might get kicked out.

799
00:55:09,764 --> 00:55:11,104
Did you get hurt?

800
00:55:13,351 --> 00:55:14,521
Does it hurt?

801
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:16,603
Of course, it does.

802
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:22,816
You have a scar.

803
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:24,452
How did you get that?

804
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:26,445
I have no idea.

805
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:28,621
It was when I was young,
so I do not remember.

806
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:31,617
That is a scar from a laceration.

807
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:34,793
My sister had one in the same place
because of me.

808
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:39,044
She fell exactly like you did just now.

809
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:49,353
A scar formed on the cut.

810
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:55,687
This will do.

811
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,690
I will do my best, Father.

812
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:05,239
Do not call me that
unless it is necessary.

813
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:07,816
It makes my skin crawl.

814
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:19,882
Did he have to be so rude about it?

815
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:23,667
Why did he throw away
such a beautiful silk handkerchief?

816
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:26,378
Wait.

817
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:37,056
It has the same design as Mu-deok's.

818
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:43,816
-Did the lord from Jinyowon leave?
-Yes.

819
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:48,318
What is this design?

820
00:56:48,404 --> 00:56:51,164
It is the crest of the Jin family.

821
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:54,038
You will go there today. Get ready.

822
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:55,872
Right.

823
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:00,423
Is that what this was?

824
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:11,638
Why would Mu-deok have something

825
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:14,099
with the crest of Jinyowon on it?

826
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:24,114
You have to get my things
without my mother finding out.

827
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:25,280
Follow me.

828
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:29,146
I wish she would just go in and stay.

829
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:40,123
Can this man really be believed?
He seems like a hack.

830
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:42,787
He must be something.

831
00:57:43,376 --> 00:57:47,206
You are both piping hot.
You have shared something.

832
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:48,967
Are you perchance lovers?

833
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:52,679
-No way.
-No.

834
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:57,931
It is my business policy
never to breach confidentiality.

835
00:57:58,016 --> 00:57:59,676
You can rest assured.

836
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:04,517
The two of you have already shared
something very meaningful, right?

837
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:06,904
He is good.

838
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:09,186
Come on.

839
00:58:11,362 --> 00:58:14,202
I heard you have been
in Gaema Village the longest.

840
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:16,702
Do you happen to know Shaman Choi?

841
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:21,246
Shaman Choi?

842
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:24,251
Are you mages patrolling for sorcery?

843
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:31,799
It is nothing like that.
I just heard she was very good.

844
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:33,763
I just want to find her because of that.

845
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:38,557
Yes, she was.

846
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:41,060
It was already over 20 years ago.

847
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:49,823
Shaman Choi was famous

848
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:53,861
for her sorcery that put hexes on people.

849
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:56,407
One day, she almost got caught

850
00:58:56,491 --> 00:59:00,371
by the mages from Cheonbugwan
who were cracking down on sorcery.

851
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:02,827
But she jumped into a fire.

852
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:08,633
Some say she died in that fire.

853
00:59:09,295 --> 00:59:13,215
Others say she was burnt badly
but survived.

854
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:15,013
That was when

855
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:18,013
your father Jang Gang
was the Gwanju of Cheonbugwan.

856
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:23,937
If Shaman Choi was hunted
by the mages of Cheonbugwan,

857
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:27,401
are you seeking her because
she bears a grudge against your father?

858
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,770
I do not even remember my father.

859
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,610
How can I know
who bears a grudge against him?

860
00:59:36,197 --> 00:59:39,237
PARK DANG-GU OF SONGRIM SWEARS NEVER
TO SEE JIN CHO-YEON OF JINYOWON AGAIN

861
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:43,619
You did not sign the paper.

862
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:46,245
I thought about signing the paper
and coming back home,

863
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:49,246
but that would be lying.

864
00:59:49,335 --> 00:59:51,295
I cannot live without seeing her.

865
00:59:54,507 --> 00:59:57,047
This did not happen overnight.

866
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:01,057
I was in love with her for a long time,
but could not express it for a long time.

867
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:03,099
I was only able to take her hand now.

868
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:05,183
Please do not call us childish

869
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:07,808
and give us a chance.

870
01:00:07,895 --> 01:00:10,185
Take your bundle of belongings

871
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:11,903
and go to Uk's home.

872
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:14,610
-Uncleâ€¦
-I need you

873
01:00:15,528 --> 01:00:17,068
to do something there.

874
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:28,709
If this person comes to his house,

875
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:30,461
let me know immediately.

876
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:32,593
Who is this?

877
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:35,585
Gwanju Jang Gang of Cheonbugwan.

878
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:37,591
He is Uk's father.

879
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:42,810
If he comes,

880
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:46,016
let me know

881
01:00:47,101 --> 01:00:48,271
right away.

882
01:00:50,938 --> 01:00:52,858
Oh, I almost forgot.

883
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:56,440
Shaman Choi had a brother.

884
01:00:57,403 --> 01:01:00,113
Do you know where he is?

885
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:04,328
I have not seen him since the incident.

886
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:08,544
But there was a rumor that

887
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:10,923
he married a woman from a powerful family.

888
01:01:35,608 --> 01:01:38,568
They said this girl
is very likely to be her.

889
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:41,317
Why is she wearing such ragged clothes?

890
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:43,866
As a child, she washed up
along Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.

891
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:46,620
She was barely alive
when the fishermen rescued her.

892
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:50,707
That experience must have
caused memory loss,

893
01:01:51,332 --> 01:01:56,302
but she can sense things around her
even though she is blind.

894
01:02:19,318 --> 01:02:22,318
You have the birthmark hereâ€¦

895
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:33,040
You have a scar in the same place.

896
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:39,835
That is why they said
you are very likely to be my Bu-yeon.

897
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:41,422
However,

898
01:02:41,507 --> 01:02:45,597
it could still be a coincidence.
Why not test her with the surest method?

899
01:02:52,518 --> 01:02:54,688
Let us go and see

900
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:57,770
if you can open the doors of Jinyowon.

901
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:09,874
The Cheonbugwan people are here again.

902
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:12,252
They must have brought
another girl to see if she is Bu-yeon.

903
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:25,718
Since you have
Jin Cho-yeon's blood in your body,

904
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:28,352
you should be able to
move the doors of Jinyowon.

905
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:32,886
Try to move the doors even a little bit.

906
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:35,186
That should be enough.

907
01:03:45,196 --> 01:03:47,696
So many girls were brought here,

908
01:03:48,407 --> 01:03:49,867
but none of them could open the door.

909
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:34,446
Bu-yeon!

910
01:04:35,746 --> 01:04:37,036
My goodness, Bu-yeon!

911
01:04:40,501 --> 01:04:44,261
It is happening again.
It happens every time I come to Jinyowon.

912
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:01,863
If it was 20 years ago,

913
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:05,228
it was when Jin Mu
was your father's pupil.

914
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:08,650
Jin Mu may know something.
Should I ask him?

915
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:10,448
Absolutely not.

916
01:05:10,531 --> 01:05:13,871
Please keep what you heard today a secret.

917
01:05:15,953 --> 01:05:19,333
What we learned today does not seem
all that important, but I will.

918
01:05:22,793 --> 01:05:26,053
Your Royal Highness,
did you say you came here alone?

919
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:27,130
I did.

920
01:05:27,214 --> 01:05:30,644
But it seems like someone is following us.

921
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:37,266
Shall we split up
to see who he is following?

922
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:18,600
Mother!

923
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:02,685
Who are you and why are you following me?

924
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:06,650
I saidâ€¦

925
01:07:10,067 --> 01:07:11,147
who are you?

926
01:08:03,412 --> 01:08:06,962
The Jin Bu-yeon that Jin Mu
has brought in is So-i, the swindler.

927
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:08,251
Why is this here?

928
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:09,754
Mu-deok is the real daughter.

929
01:08:09,835 --> 01:08:11,795
What will become of me
if she finds that out?

930
01:08:11,879 --> 01:08:14,379
Jin Mu must have something big
so that even if Jin Ho-gyeong finds out

931
01:08:14,465 --> 01:08:17,125
her daughter is a fake, she will not
be able to do anything about it.

932
01:08:17,718 --> 01:08:18,758
What do you want?

933
01:08:18,844 --> 01:08:23,354
You must fight Songrim
in order to protect the ice stone.

934
01:08:24,683 --> 01:08:26,603
Everyone, please settle down!

935
01:08:26,685 --> 01:08:29,145
Do you mean you wish to become
a hero with the fate of the King's Star

936
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:31,480
by destroying every ice stone
and saving the world from chaos?

937
01:08:31,565 --> 01:08:32,855
Is Seo Yul here?

938
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:34,572
He shall be the first person I kill.

939
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:36,527
Young Master Seo!

940
01:08:37,988 --> 01:08:38,948
There is a soul shifter.

941
01:08:39,031 --> 01:08:40,321
Jang Uk could die!

942
01:08:40,407 --> 01:08:42,407
Jang Uk, my pupilâ€¦

943
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:49,463
