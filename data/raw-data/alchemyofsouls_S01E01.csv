1,1,1,00:01:28:07,00:01:29:19,You poor thing.
1,1,2,00:01:30:14,00:01:32:22,"Child, eat this."
1,1,3,00:01:32:24,00:01:34:03,Child.
1,1,4,00:01:36:18,00:01:37:20,Go on.
1,1,5,00:01:42:04,00:01:43:18,I will bring you more meat.
1,1,6,00:01:44:07,00:01:45:18,Eat slowly.
1,1,7,00:02:26:07,00:02:27:07,Mom.
1,1,8,00:03:20:04,00:03:21:07,Geon!
1,1,9,00:03:24:23,00:03:27:20,I told you to reach out to me if anything were to happen to him.
1,1,10,00:03:27:22,00:03:29:16,How could you let things come to this?
1,1,11,00:03:29:18,00:03:32:07,He will be fine once he absorbs human energy.
1,1,12,00:03:32:09,00:03:33:22,He returns back to normal.
1,1,13,00:03:33:24,00:03:35:21,Your son has run wild.
1,1,14,00:03:39:16,00:03:41:04,I shall retrieve his soul.
1,1,15,00:03:42:03,00:03:43:21,No!
1,1,16,00:03:43:23,00:03:46:09,You were the one who turned my son into a soul shifter.
1,1,17,00:03:46:11,00:03:48:16,"Either get him another body,"
1,1,18,00:03:48:18,00:03:50:24,or feed him the energy of human souls!
1,1,19,00:03:51:18,00:03:53:00,Bring back my son.
1,1,20,00:03:53:14,00:03:55:06,Bring back my son!
1,1,21,00:03:55:23,00:03:58:00,"If word gets out that I used forbidden sorcery,"
1,1,22,00:03:59:00,00:04:00:15,we will both be doomed.
1,1,23,00:04:01:06,00:04:02:21,No…
1,1,24,00:04:02:23,00:04:03:19,Please…
1,1,25,00:04:08:04,00:04:10:13,"No, please. Geon."
1,1,26,00:04:11:10,00:04:14:01,Stay with me for just a bit longer.
1,1,27,00:04:14:16,00:04:15:19,My son…
1,1,28,00:05:28:07,00:05:31:20,Why do the bodies of soul shifters turn like rocks when they run wild?
1,1,29,00:05:31:22,00:05:35:05,"A crack forms when the bodies clash with the souls they carry,"
1,1,30,00:05:36:07,00:05:38:08,which causes them to lose energy.
1,1,31,00:05:38:23,00:05:41:14,"This is already the eighth soul
that has run wild."
1,1,32,00:05:42:03,00:05:44:13,I guess I should stop shifting souls.
1,1,33,00:05:45:04,00:05:46:24,You should go to the royal palace.
1,1,34,00:05:48:05,00:05:51:19,"His Majesty has been asking
about the new spell"
1,1,35,00:05:51:21,00:05:53:12,that you have been trying to master.
1,1,36,00:06:28:10,00:06:29:12,I hear…
1,1,37,00:06:30:13,00:06:33:09,"you have been trying to master
a new kind of spell."
1,1,38,00:06:33:22,00:06:37:14,"It is nothing grand.
It is just a trick I tried out for fun."
1,1,39,00:06:38:04,00:06:41:11,I know I cannot ask to live for longer.
1,1,40,00:06:41:13,00:06:42:17,"However,"
1,1,41,00:06:42:19,00:06:45:23,it saddens me that I do not have an heir.
1,1,42,00:06:46:19,00:06:48:19,I wish you a quick recovery.
1,1,43,00:06:49:14,00:06:52:01,I cannot do anything with this sick body.
1,1,44,00:06:52:21,00:06:55:00,But I might have a chance
1,1,45,00:06:56:03,00:06:59:19,"if I were to live in a body
that is young and healthy."
1,1,46,00:07:01:18,00:07:04:17,"There is no way for humans
to switch bodies."
1,1,47,00:07:08:00,00:07:10:06,But you can.
1,1,48,00:07:14:09,00:07:15:12,The alchemy of souls.
1,1,49,00:07:23:24,00:07:25:21,That is forbidden sorcery.
1,1,50,00:07:25:23,00:07:29:06,"If a soul clashes with the body,
it could even turn into an evil spirit."
1,1,51,00:07:29:08,00:07:30:22,How could I dare
1,1,52,00:07:30:24,00:07:33:13,"move the soul of a king
to another person's body?"
1,1,53,00:07:33:15,00:07:36:00,How about your body?
1,1,54,00:07:39:05,00:07:41:05,Not for too long. Just seven days.
1,1,55,00:07:41:18,00:07:43:16,Let us switch bodies for just seven days.
1,1,56,00:07:46:21,00:07:49:23,"I heard you once gave a soul
a dead man's body"
1,1,57,00:07:50:18,00:07:53:08,"and that it lived in that body
for over half a year."
1,1,58,00:07:54:13,00:07:58:18,"I am a king protected by the skies,
and you are the best mage in this land."
1,1,59,00:07:58:20,00:08:00:07,So what is there to worry about?
1,1,60,00:08:01:13,00:08:04:22,"And after seven days,
you can turn things back."
1,1,61,00:08:08:04,00:08:11:03,"You have mastered the ability
to do something"
1,1,62,00:08:11:06,00:08:12:18,that only the best mages can do.
1,1,63,00:08:14:00,00:08:15:21,Yet you are just wasting your time
1,1,64,00:08:15:23,00:08:17:22,shifting souls into dead bodies.
1,1,65,00:08:22:20,00:08:23:24,Jang Gang.
1,1,66,00:08:24:16,00:08:26:09,Give this king a different body.
1,1,67,00:11:07:07,00:11:09:21,His Majesty and I have switched bodies.
1,1,68,00:11:18:14,00:11:20:21,I shall make Do-hwa mine.
1,1,69,00:11:20:23,00:11:23:10,"If she bears a child,
know that it is mine."
1,1,70,00:11:25:23,00:11:27:04,Do-hwa.
1,1,71,00:11:31:15,00:11:32:18,Do-hwa.
1,1,72,00:11:34:01,00:11:35:17,You are very beautiful.
1,1,73,00:11:46:20,00:11:49:09,"No, that cannot happen."
1,1,74,00:11:53:23,00:11:56:18,That cannot happen.
1,1,75,00:11:57:10,00:11:58:15,No!
1,1,76,00:12:20:23,00:12:24:00,"The energy of the sky
rules the wind, clouds, and rain."
1,1,77,00:12:24:13,00:12:26:04,This energy reached the ground
1,1,78,00:12:27:18,00:12:29:23,and created a huge form of energy.
1,1,79,00:12:30:01,00:12:32:10,"A country was built around
Lake Gyeongcheondaeho,"
1,1,80,00:12:32:12,00:12:34:11,a lake that embodied that energy.
1,1,81,00:12:34:13,00:12:38:04,"The name of the country was Daeho,
due to the enormous lake it had."
1,1,82,00:12:40:06,00:12:43:12,"Humans who had the power
to control this great energy"
1,1,83,00:12:43:14,00:12:45:06,were called mages.
1,1,84,00:12:47:05,00:12:50:08,"This story is about the mages of Daeho,
a place that does not exist"
1,1,85,00:12:50:10,00:12:52:09,in both history books or maps.
1,1,86,00:13:08:07,00:13:12:01,20 YEARS LATER
1,1,87,00:13:21:11,00:13:22:22,"So you are Naksu,"
1,1,88,00:13:22:24,00:13:24:24,"the Shadow Assassin
who has been going around"
1,1,89,00:13:25:14,00:13:27:00,killing the mages in the city.
1,1,90,00:13:27:02,00:13:28:17,"They call me Naksu,"
1,1,91,00:13:28:19,00:13:31:01,"for wherever I go,"
1,1,92,00:13:31:03,00:13:32:07,heads fall to the ground.
1,1,93,00:13:33:01,00:13:34:19,"A beautiful name, is it not?"
1,1,94,00:13:35:24,00:13:37:00,Kill her.
1,1,95,00:13:39:12,00:13:40:09,Shoot!
1,1,96,00:16:38:16,00:16:40:03,Do not let her get away.
1,1,97,00:16:40:19,00:16:42:07,"-Capture her.
-Yes, my lord!"
1,1,98,00:16:55:04,00:16:56:22,Let us go that way. Follow me.
1,1,99,00:17:07:11,00:17:08:17,Over there!
1,1,100,00:17:58:19,00:18:00:04,I will not die like this.
1,1,101,00:18:00:24,00:18:02:05,I cannot.
1,1,102,00:18:11:01,00:18:15:03,"Goodness, you are so impatient.
I am coming."
1,1,103,00:18:31:05,00:18:32:12,What do you want?
1,1,104,00:18:35:14,00:18:37:18,"Oh, my goodness!"
1,1,105,00:19:02:10,00:19:03:18,TAVERN
1,1,106,00:19:11:07,00:19:12:12,She is dead.
1,1,107,00:19:33:20,00:19:35:13,She does not have the blue mark.
1,1,108,00:19:39:08,00:19:41:23,"This blue mark proves that
her soul has left this body."
1,1,109,00:19:43:08,00:19:44:20,Does that mean she failed
1,1,110,00:19:45:24,00:19:47:08,to enter another body?
1,1,111,00:20:16:06,00:20:21:02,SONGRIM
1,1,112,00:20:24:13,00:20:25:11,One.
1,1,113,00:20:27:22,00:20:28:18,Two.
1,1,114,00:20:30:13,00:20:31:14,Three.
1,1,115,00:20:50:22,00:20:53:11,"Yul, come here."
1,1,116,00:20:57:16,00:20:59:05,Is she Naksu?
1,1,117,00:21:00:01,00:21:01:00,Yes.
1,1,118,00:21:02:10,00:21:05:13,"This mark shows that
her soul has left the body."
1,1,119,00:21:06:03,00:21:09:00,"Remember this mark.
When someone tries to switch bodies,"
1,1,120,00:21:09:02,00:21:12:20,"it leaves a blue bruise like this
right on top of their heart."
1,1,121,00:21:13:23,00:21:16:20,Does that mean her soul escaped her body?
1,1,122,00:21:16:22,00:21:20:10,"She seems to have tried,
but I think she failed."
1,1,123,00:21:21:03,00:21:23:09,"This proves that her soul
has escaped her body,"
1,1,124,00:21:23:11,00:21:27:07,"but we found no signs of her soul
having entered another body."
1,1,125,00:21:37:10,00:21:39:19,"-It is a whistle.
-A whistle?"
1,1,126,00:21:39:22,00:21:42:18,"I once had a similar one myself
back when I had a pet bird."
1,1,127,00:21:44:18,00:21:47:03,Did she have a pet bird?
1,1,128,00:21:47:05,00:21:49:05,I think she had it for quite a while.
1,1,129,00:21:50:00,00:21:51:20,It looks like it is an important item.
1,1,130,00:21:52:16,00:21:55:19,"She may have been an assassin
who killed people like it was nothing,"
1,1,131,00:21:55:21,00:22:00:05,"but she was still human.
She must have had a story of her own."
1,1,132,00:22:08:04,00:22:10:18,"A lot of people have
already seen Naksu's body."
1,1,133,00:22:10:20,00:22:13:01,"Word will spread
about the alchemy of souls."
1,1,134,00:22:13:17,00:22:16:17,"Has it been 20 years
since we have seen a soul shifter?"
1,1,135,00:22:17:06,00:22:18:06,Yes.
1,1,136,00:22:19:08,00:22:22:18,"The last soul shifter ran wild
and ended up killing many people."
1,1,137,00:22:23:18,00:22:27:02,I am worried that might happen again.
1,1,138,00:22:27:16,00:22:30:01,Uncle!
1,1,139,00:22:31:22,00:22:34:16,"Uncle, I heard Naksu was a soul shifter."
1,1,140,00:22:35:05,00:22:37:03,"Master Heo, did you see her too?"
1,1,141,00:22:37:05,00:22:40:17,You seem awfully excited to start rumors.
1,1,142,00:22:40:19,00:22:43:11,"Rumors have already spread.
I came as soon as I heard."
1,1,143,00:22:44:01,00:22:45:22,"-Where did you hear it?
-At Chwiseonru."
1,1,144,00:22:45:24,00:22:47:17,You are a mage of Jeongjingak.
1,1,145,00:22:47:19,00:22:51:14,"But instead of practicing,
you go to bars and listen to rumors."
1,1,146,00:22:53:03,00:22:57:15,"Songrim Jeongjingak is not only a place
for mages to practice their spells,"
1,1,147,00:22:57:17,00:22:59:14,but also a place to gather information.
1,1,148,00:23:00:15,00:23:03:00,"Also, Dang-gu here will"
1,1,149,00:23:03:02,00:23:05:06,follow in your footsteps
1,1,150,00:23:05:08,00:23:07:10,"and become the leader
of the Songrim household."
1,1,151,00:23:07:12,00:23:09:08,He should know his liquor.
1,1,152,00:23:09:10,00:23:10:11,"Now, tell me."
1,1,153,00:23:11:04,00:23:13:11,Which liquor tastes best at Chwiseonru?
1,1,154,00:23:14:10,00:23:17:09,"I do not go there as often anymore
now that Uk is not here."
1,1,155,00:23:17:11,00:23:19:12,"""Uk""? The son of Jang Gang?"
1,1,156,00:23:19:14,00:23:23:23,"Is he not learning how to write
at the village school in Yeongchundang?"
1,1,157,00:23:24:00,00:23:26:02,He got kicked out of there ages ago.
1,1,158,00:23:26:04,00:23:28:02,"Right now, he is in Gisan."
1,1,159,00:23:28:04,00:23:31:22,"I sent him to receive training
from Buddhist Monk Ho-yeong."
1,1,160,00:23:33:09,00:23:37:02,"Uk went to train
at a Buddhist temple this time?"
1,1,161,00:23:38:17,00:23:41:13,"Today, I shall end my training."
1,1,162,00:23:43:01,00:23:45:17,You have not even finished your training.
1,1,163,00:23:45:19,00:23:48:23,"How dare you decide
to end the training without my permission."
1,1,164,00:23:49:00,00:23:50:09,"You asked me to expand my knowledge,"
1,1,165,00:23:50:11,00:23:53:07,"so I read and memorized
hundreds of spell books."
1,1,166,00:23:53:09,00:23:55:03,"You asked me to train my mind,"
1,1,167,00:23:55:05,00:23:57:19,"so I patiently sharpened
hundreds of swords."
1,1,168,00:23:57:21,00:24:01:19,"However, you never taught me
any kind of spell."
1,1,169,00:24:02:09,00:24:04:18,The only lesson I learned here is that
1,1,170,00:24:04:20,00:24:09:08,"you have no intentions
of teaching me spells at all."
1,1,171,00:24:09:22,00:24:12:09,"Now that I have learned a big lesson,"
1,1,172,00:24:12:11,00:24:14:02,I would like to end it and leave.
1,1,173,00:24:14:15,00:24:17:20,"The leader of Songrim asked me
to keep you here for three years."
1,1,174,00:24:17:22,00:24:21:05,"I know you are building a sanctuary
with the money I paid you in advance."
1,1,175,00:24:21:07,00:24:24:04,"I will not ask for a refund,
so I hope it is successfully built."
1,1,176,00:24:26:07,00:24:29:07,"Where do you think you are going?
I never said you could leave!"
1,1,177,00:24:31:04,00:24:34:14,"Did it sound like
I was asking for your permission?"
1,1,178,00:24:37:04,00:24:39:06,"You were conceived
through your mother's affair"
1,1,179,00:24:39:08,00:24:41:00,and were abandoned by your father.
1,1,180,00:24:41:02,00:24:43:15,"So what would you know
about respecting your master?"
1,1,181,00:24:43:17,00:24:46:11,I refuse to teach a guy like you.
1,1,182,00:24:47:12,00:24:49:16,"I may not know much about
respecting a master,"
1,1,183,00:24:49:18,00:24:51:09,but I do know how to be a creditor.
1,1,184,00:24:51:11,00:24:53:00,"Say one more word,"
1,1,185,00:24:53:02,00:24:55:08,"and you will not be able
to build that sanctuary."
1,1,186,00:24:56:23,00:24:58:18,Because I will be getting a refund.
1,1,187,00:24:59:11,00:25:04:05,"No one in this world will teach you spells
because of your father."
1,1,188,00:25:04:07,00:25:06:20,"Goodness, thank you for your concern."
1,1,189,00:25:07:22,00:25:11:09,I will find my own master.
1,1,190,00:25:12:03,00:25:15:06,Someone extremely powerful and skilled.
1,1,191,00:25:32:13,00:25:34:04,"Mu-deok, are you all right?"
1,1,192,00:26:35:02,00:26:38:00,"Why did I have to enter
a body like this one?"
1,1,193,00:26:41:00,00:26:43:05,I am sure she was blind.
1,1,194,00:26:48:08,00:26:50:03,But why is it that I see?
1,1,195,00:26:50:20,00:26:52:13,Is it because I am a different soul?
1,1,196,00:26:55:08,00:26:58:02,"She did not even have a blue mark
showing I entered her body."
1,1,197,00:26:58:04,00:26:59:15,How unusual.
1,1,198,00:27:00:17,00:27:03:18,"Try to bear with the motion sickness.
We are almost there, Mu-deok."
1,1,199,00:27:06:07,00:27:07:06,"""Mu-deok."""
1,1,200,00:27:07:08,00:27:10:20,"She is a blind girl from the countryside
who got sold off to the fortress."
1,1,201,00:27:14:09,00:27:15:18,Sit down. You will fall.
1,1,202,00:27:26:18,00:27:28:04,Thanks for the journey.
1,1,203,00:27:29:01,00:27:30:01,I will be off now.
1,1,204,00:27:42:12,00:27:43:19,What is wrong with me?
1,1,205,00:27:44:08,00:27:45:17,I have no strength.
1,1,206,00:27:46:11,00:27:48:21,"Is this body not capable of
even climbing this?"
1,1,207,00:27:50:24,00:27:52:03,My arms feel weak.
1,1,208,00:27:53:01,00:27:54:07,Mister!
1,1,209,00:27:54:22,00:27:56:12,"-Help me!
-What…"
1,1,210,00:27:56:14,00:27:58:08,"-Mister!
-Oh, dear!"
1,1,211,00:27:58:10,00:27:59:19,"Mu-deok, hold on!"
1,1,212,00:27:59:21,00:28:00:18,Mister!
1,1,213,00:28:00:20,00:28:03:11,Turn the boat around! Go back!
1,1,214,00:28:03:13,00:28:05:03,"-My goodness.
-Oh, dear! Mu-deok!"
1,1,215,00:28:05:05,00:28:06:07,I will fall.
1,1,216,00:28:06:09,00:28:07:10,Mister!
1,1,217,00:28:19:08,00:28:23:10,"Why were you hanging from there
when you cannot even see?"
1,1,218,00:28:23:12,00:28:24:20,You could have gotten hurt.
1,1,219,00:28:26:16,00:28:28:03,This is really bad.
1,1,220,00:28:28:05,00:28:30:01,My strength is gone.
1,1,221,00:28:35:13,00:28:37:00,Is it motion sickness again?
1,1,222,00:28:37:16,00:28:40:22,I am so worried about how weak you are.
1,1,223,00:28:41:11,00:28:42:23,Weak.
1,1,224,00:28:43:00,00:28:45:09,"This body is
unbelievably unhealthy and weak."
1,1,225,00:28:46:02,00:28:49:05,"I should not switch bodies too soon.
Let us stay as Mu-deok for now."
1,1,226,00:28:49:21,00:28:52:03,"I am sorry, Mister."
1,1,227,00:28:52:05,00:28:53:12,It is fine.
1,1,228,00:28:53:14,00:28:55:05,It is all because your body is weak.
1,1,229,00:28:55:24,00:28:57:03,Let us fill ourselves up.
1,1,230,00:29:09:24,00:29:10:20,"-Enjoy.
-Thank you."
1,1,231,00:29:10:22,00:29:12:16,"Today, let us eat good food."
1,1,232,00:29:12:18,00:29:14:03,It is chicken. Enjoy.
1,1,233,00:29:15:11,00:29:17:24,"As an assassin,
I am sensitive to the smell of blood."
1,1,234,00:29:18:01,00:29:21:23,"Thus, I do not eat animals that shed
the same colored blood as humans."
1,1,235,00:29:22:00,00:29:23:16,"-I will pass.
-Just eat."
1,1,236,00:29:31:16,00:29:34:06,It is my first time eating meat.
1,1,237,00:29:35:15,00:29:36:19,It is delicious.
1,1,238,00:29:41:13,00:29:42:15,Eat up.
1,1,239,00:29:42:17,00:29:46:08,"I really did not want to send you there,"
1,1,240,00:29:46:10,00:29:49:05,"but it was the only place
that agreed to take a blind person."
1,1,241,00:29:51:15,00:29:54:18,"""There""? Where are you talking about?"
1,1,242,00:29:57:13,00:30:00:16,"An old woman took her in
after she lost both her parents."
1,1,243,00:30:00:18,00:30:02:23,But she got sick and recently passed away.
1,1,244,00:30:03:00,00:30:05:12,"The debt she had due to her illness
got passed onto her,"
1,1,245,00:30:05:14,00:30:07:11,which is why she's here to be sold off.
1,1,246,00:30:07:13,00:30:08:12,I will be off now.
1,1,247,00:30:09:12,00:30:11:19,"You cannot sell
this poor soul to a brothel."
1,1,248,00:30:11:21,00:30:14:05,"-I wish you well.
-But…"
1,1,249,00:30:16:09,00:30:19:08,"I cannot believe he fed me chicken
just to sell me to this place."
1,1,250,00:30:19:11,00:30:22:14,"I will rip you to pieces
as soon as I regain my power."
1,1,251,00:30:23:01,00:30:25:03,You are way too skinny.
1,1,252,00:30:25:06,00:30:28:01,"I wonder if you will become prettier
if you become chubbier."
1,1,253,00:30:28:03,00:30:30:14,"Just give up.
Getting chubby will not make me prettier."
1,1,254,00:30:31:04,00:30:33:18,"I am useless and not suitable
to work at a brothel."
1,1,255,00:30:33:20,00:30:35:05,Sell me off to someplace else.
1,1,256,00:30:35:07,00:30:37:10,You talk very eloquently.
1,1,257,00:30:38:00,00:30:39:04,I heard you sing well.
1,1,258,00:30:39:06,00:30:41:15,I hope you sing as well as you talk.
1,1,259,00:30:44:09,00:30:47:06,"You should wash first.
And doll yourself up."
1,1,260,00:31:01:15,00:31:03:09,You even know how to dance?
1,1,261,00:31:03:23,00:31:05:01,Did it look like a dance?
1,1,262,00:31:05:24,00:31:09:03,"If my moves contained power,
your arm would have fallen right off."
1,1,263,00:31:12:09,00:31:15:00,"I am older than you,
so you should speak in honorifics."
1,1,264,00:31:15:03,00:31:17:11,"You better treat
our customers with respect too."
1,1,265,00:31:17:13,00:31:19:22,You just wait. I will kill you too.
1,1,266,00:31:21:04,00:31:25:00,"A lot of powerful people
come to our brothel."
1,1,267,00:31:25:14,00:31:28:19,"The Four Seasons of Daeho
are also regulars of Chwiseonru."
1,1,268,00:31:29:23,00:31:31:01,The four what?
1,1,269,00:31:31:03,00:31:34:10,"There are four different types
of beautiful people in Daeho Fortress."
1,1,270,00:31:34:12,00:31:36:15,And they are called the Four Seasons.
1,1,271,00:31:51:09,00:31:54:16,"The daughter of the Jin family
who has the vitality of spring."
1,1,272,00:31:55:12,00:31:56:10,Jin Cho-yeon.
1,1,273,00:32:11:23,00:32:14:20,"The heir of the Park family
who has the energy of a hot summer."
1,1,274,00:32:14:22,00:32:16:03,Park Dang-gu.
1,1,275,00:32:27:23,00:32:31:07,"The genius of the Seo family
who is as noble as the sunset in fall."
1,1,276,00:32:32:02,00:32:33:02,Seo Yul.
1,1,277,00:32:51:01,00:32:55:02,"Then there is Jang Uk,
the successor of the Jang family"
1,1,278,00:32:55:04,00:32:58:17,who is as dazzling as the winter snow.
1,1,279,00:33:06:10,00:33:09:03,"The Jin, Park, Seo, and Jang family."
1,1,280,00:33:09:05,00:33:12:06,"They are the most well-known
mage families in Daeho."
1,1,281,00:33:12:08,00:33:14:08,"Their children are known as
the Four Seasons."
1,1,282,00:33:15:11,00:33:18:01,"Is that what they are called
in the fortress?"
1,1,283,00:33:20:07,00:33:23:06,There is my summer prince.
1,1,284,00:33:28:03,00:33:30:05,"If he is the heir of the Park family,"
1,1,285,00:33:30:20,00:33:32:14,he must be Park Jin's nephew.
1,1,286,00:33:35:05,00:33:36:03,Park Jin.
1,1,287,00:33:39:17,00:33:42:03,He was there that night too.
1,1,288,00:33:51:16,00:33:52:17,Jin.
1,1,289,00:33:53:16,00:33:54:19,Seo.
1,1,290,00:33:55:12,00:33:56:17,Jang.
1,1,291,00:33:57:10,00:33:58:15,Park.
1,1,292,00:34:07:24,00:34:08:24,The Four Seasons?
1,1,293,00:34:10:10,00:34:14:05,"Once I come across all four of you,
it will be the end of it."
1,1,294,00:34:17:05,00:34:19:18,"May you greet your deaths
as beautifully as your names."
1,1,295,00:34:23:20,00:34:26:12,Who are you here to meet today?
1,1,296,00:34:26:14,00:34:30:10,"My uncle told me
to come and fetch someone."
1,1,297,00:34:30:24,00:34:33:03,Fetch someone? Who?
1,1,298,00:34:33:05,00:34:35:21,A trainee in Gisan
1,1,299,00:34:35:23,00:34:38:21,humiliated his master and got sent away.
1,1,300,00:34:39:24,00:34:42:12,I bet this is where he is hiding.
1,1,301,00:34:43:09,00:34:44:24,Will you look at that?
1,1,302,00:34:45:02,00:34:48:08,"He must have craved seafood
because he was stuck in the mountains"
1,1,303,00:34:48:10,00:34:50:10,for so long.
1,1,304,00:34:50:12,00:34:52:09,I guess he is in that room.
1,1,305,00:35:12:03,00:35:13:05,Goodness.
1,1,306,00:35:14:10,00:35:16:16,"Thanks to you, my uncle has to go"
1,1,307,00:35:16:18,00:35:19:18,"all the way to Gisan
to beg for the monk's forgiveness."
1,1,308,00:35:19:20,00:35:24:14,"Meanwhile, you are here
enjoying this damn crab."
1,1,309,00:35:24:16,00:35:26:08,"No, I have not eaten it."
1,1,310,00:35:26:10,00:35:27:18,It is such a hassle to eat.
1,1,311,00:35:28:08,00:35:30:16,"I am glad you came.
Break the shell with your spell."
1,1,312,00:35:31:16,00:35:32:23,Unbelievable.
1,1,313,00:35:33:00,00:35:36:24,"I do know how to crack the shell
and pick out just the meat."
1,1,314,00:35:37:01,00:35:39:17,"But maybe I should use that spell on you,
not the crab."
1,1,315,00:35:39:20,00:35:43:05,"Dang-gu, if that monk had been
kind enough to at least teach me that,"
1,1,316,00:35:43:07,00:35:45:07,I would not have left that way.
1,1,317,00:35:45:09,00:35:47:01,What good is it if you cannot do it?
1,1,318,00:35:47:03,00:35:49:01,Your dad blocked you from casting spells.
1,1,319,00:35:49:03,00:35:50:18,Then he should have helped me break that.
1,1,320,00:35:50:20,00:35:54:07,"That is what masters do.
They help their students."
1,1,321,00:35:54:10,00:35:57:01,No one in Daeho is brave enough
1,1,322,00:35:57:03,00:35:59:08,to go against your dad like that.
1,1,323,00:35:59:10,00:36:00:24,But some live fearlessly.
1,1,324,00:36:01:01,00:36:02:07,"For example,"
1,1,325,00:36:03:06,00:36:05:04,"the Shadow Assassin, Naksu."
1,1,326,00:36:09:13,00:36:10:16,Do not be ridiculous.
1,1,327,00:36:10:18,00:36:14:00,"I heard she is so skilled that
even the leader cannot beat her."
1,1,328,00:36:15:07,00:36:16:15,She is dead.
1,1,329,00:36:17:07,00:36:20:03,"Her soul left her body,
so that means she might still be alive."
1,1,330,00:36:21:15,00:36:22:23,Who told you that?
1,1,331,00:36:23:15,00:36:26:05,"Do you think I am here
just so I can eat crab?"
1,1,332,00:36:26:07,00:36:27:14,This is the fastest place
1,1,333,00:36:27:16,00:36:29:20,to hear everything that goes on in Daeho.
1,1,334,00:36:30:08,00:36:31:19,Pick out the meat already.
1,1,335,00:36:31:21,00:36:34:16,"Put those spells to good use
and pick out the crab meat."
1,1,336,00:36:34:18,00:36:37:24,"Why can you not pick out
the meat yourself, you lazybones?"
1,1,337,00:36:41:12,00:36:43:24,You look pretty now that you have washed.
1,1,338,00:36:44:01,00:36:45:06,Let me put makeup on you.
1,1,339,00:36:46:11,00:36:48:23,"Ju-wol, I will just do it myself."
1,1,340,00:36:49:01,00:36:51:18,But how? You cannot even see.
1,1,341,00:36:53:01,00:36:54:24,"I have never done this in my life,"
1,1,342,00:36:55:01,00:36:57:03,so I need to prepare myself.
1,1,343,00:36:58:14,00:37:00:16,I would like to be alone for a while.
1,1,344,00:37:02:15,00:37:04:22,Sure. Come out when you are ready.
1,1,345,00:37:16:00,00:37:18:06,"Being blind makes it easier
to fool people."
1,1,346,00:37:19:11,00:37:21:01,I need money to run away.
1,1,347,00:37:23:15,00:37:25:01,Are these made of real gold?
1,1,348,00:37:26:15,00:37:28:03,This is jade.
1,1,349,00:37:28:23,00:37:32:01,"Mu-deok, try applying this new rouge."
1,1,350,00:37:33:16,00:37:34:13,What are you doing?
1,1,351,00:37:36:02,00:37:38:10,"Ju-wol, what is wrong?"
1,1,352,00:37:41:07,00:37:42:24,Can you see?
1,1,353,00:37:52:10,00:37:54:21,Catch Mu-deok! Catch the thief!
1,1,354,00:38:00:16,00:38:01:23,It is too high.
1,1,355,00:38:10:08,00:38:11:05,That way!
1,1,356,00:38:34:24,00:38:36:10,What are you looking at?
1,1,357,00:38:54:06,00:38:55:09,You…
1,1,358,00:39:03:07,00:39:04:16,Do not make a sound.
1,1,359,00:39:06:12,00:39:09:09,"I heard a blind girl
recently joined the place."
1,1,360,00:39:10:00,00:39:11:01,But you can see.
1,1,361,00:39:14:01,00:39:15:20,They told me your name.
1,1,362,00:39:15:22,00:39:17:23,"I think it started with a ""D""
or something."
1,1,363,00:39:18:00,00:39:19:02,No.
1,1,364,00:39:20:11,00:39:21:16,"Oh, I remember."
1,1,365,00:39:22:14,00:39:23:11,Mu-deok.
1,1,366,00:39:25:05,00:39:27:13,"Yes, I am Mu-deok."
1,1,367,00:39:28:10,00:39:31:02,"I know what you look like,"
1,1,368,00:39:31:05,00:39:33:12,"so if you do not stay quiet until I leave,"
1,1,369,00:39:33:14,00:39:35:09,I will come back and behead you.
1,1,370,00:39:39:07,00:39:40:08,What is so funny?
1,1,371,00:39:42:08,00:39:43:16,You have beautiful eyes.
1,1,372,00:39:46:12,00:39:47:12,Cut the nonsense.
1,1,373,00:39:48:15,00:39:51:15,"Right, sorry.
Only your eyes are beautiful."
1,1,374,00:39:53:14,00:39:54:18,You must be crazy.
1,1,375,00:40:01:17,00:40:02:13,Mu-deok.
1,1,376,00:40:03:05,00:40:04:13,Mu-deok!
1,1,377,00:40:06:03,00:40:08:18,Come on. There is not much in there.
1,1,378,00:40:10:17,00:40:11:21,Just…
1,1,379,00:40:12:22,00:40:13:21,take this instead.
1,1,380,00:40:17:07,00:40:18:09,Hey…
1,1,381,00:40:37:11,00:40:40:07,"-What are you looking at?
-What? Nothing."
1,1,382,00:40:45:17,00:40:46:16,Dang-gu.
1,1,383,00:40:48:05,00:40:51:02,"I heard Naksu,
the Shadow Assassin, uses Tansu."
1,1,384,00:40:51:04,00:40:53:02,What do you know about Tansu?
1,1,385,00:40:53:04,00:40:55:17,"I know enough.
I read about it in my free time."
1,1,386,00:40:56:05,00:40:57:03,TANSU
1,1,387,00:40:57:20,00:40:59:13,"You see, Tansu is"
1,1,388,00:40:59:15,00:41:02:24,"a type of swordsmanship
that only the best mages can learn."
1,1,389,00:41:03:01,00:41:05:20,"You flick energy with a blade
just like how you flick water."
1,1,390,00:41:05:23,00:41:08:09,A single strike is enough to kill someone.
1,1,391,00:41:18:03,00:41:20:11,But why do you ask?
1,1,392,00:41:21:03,00:41:24:15,"I am just wondering if this crab leg
almost could have killed me."
1,1,393,00:41:24:17,00:41:27:13,"Give it here. Give it to me.
I will pick out the meat--"
1,1,394,00:41:29:01,00:41:32:04,"Listen, Uk.
You are aiming at a vital point."
1,1,395,00:41:33:19,00:41:35:00,I could die.
1,1,396,00:41:35:02,00:41:37:07,"Yes, she aimed at my vital point
in just one go."
1,1,397,00:41:40:10,00:41:43:10,But why did she roll off then?
1,1,398,00:41:49:01,00:41:52:10,"Why is it that this tiny body
keeps craving food?"
1,1,399,00:41:52:12,00:41:54:19,"If I do not eat, I only become weaker."
1,1,400,00:41:55:07,00:41:56:15,I have no other choice.
1,1,401,00:42:07:07,00:42:09:15,"Now is not the time to fight.
I should hold it in."
1,1,402,00:42:15:09,00:42:16:24,The mages of Jeongjingak are here.
1,1,403,00:42:22:10,00:42:24:18,"I heard an assassin
has entered Songrim Jeongjingak."
1,1,404,00:42:24:20,00:42:26:22,What fool would break into Jeongjingak?
1,1,405,00:42:27:00,00:42:29:05,"She aimed for the leader, but got caught."
1,1,406,00:42:29:07,00:42:30:18,The assassin is a young lady.
1,1,407,00:42:30:20,00:42:32:07,My goodness gracious.
1,1,408,00:43:04:00,00:43:06:11,He would have seen my dead body.
1,1,409,00:43:06:13,00:43:08:00,He likely did not recognize me.
1,1,410,00:43:09:03,00:43:12:18,"I am sure he did not recognize
the whistle either."
1,1,411,00:43:22:03,00:43:24:21,"There are no signs of Naksu
having visited this place."
1,1,412,00:43:25:14,00:43:28:08,I think she failed to find a new body.
1,1,413,00:43:29:11,00:43:32:04,"Even if she succeeded,
she probably is not showing herself"
1,1,414,00:43:32:06,00:43:34:14,because she is facing a problem.
1,1,415,00:43:34:16,00:43:37:11,"An assassin with a revealed identity
must be discarded."
1,1,416,00:43:39:22,00:43:41:21,"We will have to
retrieve her body and sword."
1,1,417,00:43:41:23,00:43:44:05,"Get rid of all everything
that has to do with her."
1,1,418,00:43:44:07,00:43:48:06,What happens if she is still alive?
1,1,419,00:43:49:20,00:43:52:05,"She will either get killed
for being a soul shifter,"
1,1,420,00:43:52:07,00:43:54:13,"or her soul will clash with her new body,"
1,1,421,00:43:54:15,00:43:56:06,and she will turn into a rock.
1,1,422,00:43:56:21,00:43:59:07,I trained her to become the best assassin.
1,1,423,00:44:00:04,00:44:01:10,It is a pity.
1,1,424,00:44:09:20,00:44:11:09,How much longer do you need?
1,1,425,00:44:11:12,00:44:15:11,"It is expensive,
so I need to take a closer look."
1,1,426,00:44:15:13,00:44:18:20,"I will not ask for too much.
Just pick a price and pay me."
1,1,427,00:44:21:05,00:44:22:01,Over here!
1,1,428,00:44:22:24,00:44:24:14,"-It is her.
-What is going on?"
1,1,429,00:44:24:16,00:44:25:19,Take her away!
1,1,430,00:44:41:10,00:44:43:23,Where am I? Did I get caught?
1,1,431,00:44:45:03,00:44:46:17,Then is this Songrim?
1,1,432,00:44:49:22,00:44:51:06,Are you awake?
1,1,433,00:44:51:08,00:44:53:17,Who are you? Where is this place?
1,1,434,00:44:57:18,00:45:00:16,"It is the house of Master Jang Gang,
the head of Cheonbugwan."
1,1,435,00:45:01:06,00:45:04:10,"""Jang Gang""?
So this is the Jang family's house?"
1,1,436,00:45:08:20,00:45:13:07,"I wonder why Young Master
brought home such a weak girl."
1,1,437,00:45:13:09,00:45:15:21,"-""Young Master""?
-That is right."
1,1,438,00:45:15:24,00:45:19:18,"Young Master Jang Uk paid money
to bring you here from the brothel."
1,1,439,00:45:19:21,00:45:23:09,"I heard you stole
his Jade Plaque at the brothel."
1,1,440,00:45:25:09,00:45:26:17,Take this instead.
1,1,441,00:45:28:18,00:45:29:23,Hey…
1,1,442,00:45:30:21,00:45:32:15,Why would he bring me here?
1,1,443,00:45:32:17,00:45:35:15,"I was worried when he said
he was going to bring home a girl,"
1,1,444,00:45:36:05,00:45:38:00,but you put me at ease.
1,1,445,00:45:38:02,00:45:39:19,He only helped out of pity.
1,1,446,00:45:40:14,00:45:42:21,Here. Get changed.
1,1,447,00:45:42:23,00:45:44:03,Mu-deok.
1,1,448,00:45:44:06,00:45:46:06,"-What is this?
-What do you think?"
1,1,449,00:45:46:08,00:45:48:03,It is your uniform as a servant.
1,1,450,00:45:48:05,00:45:52:06,"Also, you need to speak to me
using honorifics."
1,1,451,00:45:53:20,00:45:55:10,"Young Master Jang is weak,"
1,1,452,00:45:55:12,00:45:57:09,so he gets tired very easily.
1,1,453,00:45:57:11,00:45:59:17,"Make sure you do things
as soon as you are asked."
1,1,454,00:46:00:07,00:46:03:23,"And always put on a smile
no matter what he says."
1,1,455,00:46:05:03,00:46:06:05,Where is my answer?
1,1,456,00:46:07:09,00:46:09:11,"-Yes, ma'am.
-Good."
1,1,457,00:46:10:01,00:46:13:11,"He wanted to see you as soon as possible,
so get changed and go see him."
1,1,458,00:46:13:14,00:46:14:16,Answer me.
1,1,459,00:46:15:08,00:46:16:12,Yes…
1,1,460,00:46:17:16,00:46:18:12,Miss.
1,1,461,00:46:20:04,00:46:22:01,"I would rather you call me ""ma'am."""
1,1,462,00:46:26:10,00:46:27:14,"""Young Master""?"
1,1,463,00:46:28:19,00:46:30:11,Why would he bring me home?
1,1,464,00:46:33:16,00:46:35:01,You have beautiful eyes.
1,1,465,00:46:36:03,00:46:37:12,Did he fall for me?
1,1,466,00:46:38:24,00:46:40:09,For this face?
1,1,467,00:46:42:01,00:46:43:16,He has very low taste.
1,1,468,00:46:51:08,00:46:53:14,"Anyway, it might be safer for me"
1,1,469,00:46:53:16,00:46:56:01,to live here until I fully recover.
1,1,470,00:46:57:13,00:47:01:14,"If he is head over heels for me,
at least he will treat me right."
1,1,471,00:47:02:18,00:47:04:08,Then…
1,1,472,00:47:04:10,00:47:08:05,"I guess I will have to continue
living my life as Mu-deok here."
1,1,473,00:47:09:14,00:47:12:12,"Young Master. It is me, Mu-deok."
1,1,474,00:47:13:11,00:47:14:14,Come in.
1,1,475,00:47:25:15,00:47:26:13,Young Master.
1,1,476,00:47:26:15,00:47:28:16,Thank you so much for saving my life
1,1,477,00:47:28:19,00:47:31:04,and bringing me here.
1,1,478,00:47:32:05,00:47:34:07,It just took a few men to drag you here.
1,1,479,00:47:36:00,00:47:38:18,"-I am disappointed.
-I know it was rude of me"
1,1,480,00:47:38:20,00:47:42:21,"to threaten you with a crab leg,
but I hope you will put that behind you."
1,1,481,00:47:42:23,00:47:44:11,You sound a lot more polite now.
1,1,482,00:47:44:13,00:47:46:14,I will do my best to serve you right.
1,1,483,00:47:47:07,00:47:48:19,"Fine, you do that."
1,1,484,00:47:48:21,00:47:51:06,"Mu-deok, go and get me some water."
1,1,485,00:47:51:24,00:47:53:04,"Yes, Young Master."
1,1,486,00:48:00:10,00:48:01:06,Gosh.
1,1,487,00:48:01:21,00:48:03:18,I am not thirsty. It is to wash myself.
1,1,488,00:48:04:12,00:48:06:14,"Oh, I see. I understand, Young Master."
1,1,489,00:48:11:03,00:48:13:09,"I will just take a bath
instead of washing my face."
1,1,490,00:48:20:02,00:48:21:12,"Gosh, that is hot."
1,1,491,00:48:21:14,00:48:23:13,This is much too hot.
1,1,492,00:48:25:04,00:48:26:15,"Right, Young Master."
1,1,493,00:48:32:22,00:48:34:10,"Oh, gosh. It is cold."
1,1,494,00:48:34:24,00:48:36:21,The water is freezing.
1,1,495,00:48:39:21,00:48:41:01,It is not freezing.
1,1,496,00:48:41:03,00:48:43:12,"It is. I will catch a cold
if I wash in cold water."
1,1,497,00:48:45:08,00:48:47:03,"-What is his deal?
-It is so cold."
1,1,498,00:48:47:05,00:48:48:09,Did he not fall for me?
1,1,499,00:48:48:11,00:48:49:23,"What are you doing, Mu-deok?"
1,1,500,00:48:51:03,00:48:54:08,"Yes, Young Master.
I will pour in some more hot water."
1,1,501,00:49:00:04,00:49:01:00,It is salty.
1,1,502,00:49:01:22,00:49:02:22,Too sweet. Too spicy.
1,1,503,00:49:02:24,00:49:04:13,It is too long. What is this taste?
1,1,504,00:49:04:15,00:49:05:21,I'm not going to eat.
1,1,505,00:49:09:08,00:49:11:00,The water smells weird.
1,1,506,00:49:11:18,00:49:12:16,It smells?
1,1,507,00:49:13:16,00:49:14:23,Bring me a new bucket.
1,1,508,00:49:18:00,00:49:18:23,Get a different blanket.
1,1,509,00:49:19:22,00:49:22:05,I want the blue blanket tonight.
1,1,510,00:49:44:14,00:49:48:11,"He does not do anything,
but he washes three times a day."
1,1,511,00:49:52:09,00:49:53:13,I will kill him.
1,1,512,00:49:53:15,00:49:57:06,"Once I regain my energy,
he'll be the first one I kill."
1,1,513,00:50:01:10,00:50:04:05,"Young Master, I brought you cold water."
1,1,514,00:50:04:22,00:50:07:08,"-I brought…
-Forget it. The water has cooled"
1,1,515,00:50:07:10,00:50:08:22,to just the right temperature.
1,1,516,00:50:10:08,00:50:11:10,Good work…
1,1,517,00:50:11:12,00:50:13:22,"I mean, your work was all in vain,
Mu-deok."
1,1,518,00:50:25:01,00:50:26:12,If only I had the power…
1,1,519,00:50:27:06,00:50:30:13,"If I just had a fraction
of the power I used to have…"
1,1,520,00:50:42:16,00:50:43:21,What is going on?
1,1,521,00:50:44:14,00:50:47:20,What is happening?
1,1,522,00:51:04:21,00:51:06:00,What is so funny?
1,1,523,00:51:07:10,00:51:08:08,What?
1,1,524,00:51:09:09,00:51:11:00,What is with that smile?
1,1,525,00:51:12:00,00:51:13:02,It is nothing.
1,1,526,00:51:13:04,00:51:14:19,The water is nice and cold.
1,1,527,00:51:15:18,00:51:17:00,Go fetch my clothes.
1,1,528,00:51:17:02,00:51:18:09,"Right, Young Master."
1,1,529,00:51:20:07,00:51:21:10,Gosh.
1,1,530,00:51:27:07,00:51:28:03,What are you doing?
1,1,531,00:51:29:20,00:51:31:04,Here you go.
1,1,532,00:51:33:13,00:51:35:12,You may leave. Get some rest.
1,1,533,00:51:36:04,00:51:37:10,"Yes, Young Master."
1,1,534,00:51:49:04,00:51:53:06,"That Spirit Plaque will allow me
to break the barrier and enter Songrim."
1,1,535,00:51:55:04,00:51:56:20,But I cannot do that right now
1,1,536,00:51:56:22,00:51:58:24,"because I do not have
the power to cast spells."
1,1,537,00:52:00:15,00:52:01:21,I should find my sword.
1,1,538,00:52:03:10,00:52:06:08,"I might get my power back
if I find my sword."
1,1,539,00:52:09:19,00:52:11:06,"With that Spirit Plaque,"
1,1,540,00:52:12:04,00:52:14:15,I will be able to enter Songrim.
1,1,541,00:52:18:20,00:52:22:15,SONGRIM
1,1,542,00:52:23:20,00:52:27:01,"How long do you plan to keep
Naksu's body at Jeongjingak?"
1,1,543,00:52:27:18,00:52:29:20,"If she succeeded in finding a new body,"
1,1,544,00:52:30:08,00:52:31:10,Naksu…
1,1,545,00:52:32:11,00:52:33:21,will come back for her sword.
1,1,546,00:52:35:15,00:52:38:21,She will come here looking for her body.
1,1,547,00:52:40:04,00:52:42:07,Let us see how things turn out.
1,1,548,00:52:48:23,00:52:52:02,"Maybe it is because
your father's room is always empty,"
1,1,549,00:52:52:22,00:52:54:13,but it never seems to get dusty.
1,1,550,00:52:55:15,00:52:57:10,I wonder when he will return.
1,1,551,00:53:01:09,00:53:04:21,"The colors in your mother's portrait
are starting to fade away."
1,1,552,00:53:05:11,00:53:07:23,"We should call a painter
to repaint the colors."
1,1,553,00:53:30:15,00:53:33:02,"I memorized all the books
you told me to read."
1,1,554,00:53:33:16,00:53:35:17,"Now, teach me how to practice spells"
1,1,555,00:53:35:19,00:53:37:22,just like how you taught Yul and Dang-gu.
1,1,556,00:53:46:11,00:53:49:04,That sword belongs to your father.
1,1,557,00:53:49:06,00:53:50:14,Take it out.
1,1,558,00:54:03:17,00:54:05:19,"Due to the spell that has been cast on me,"
1,1,559,00:54:05:21,00:54:08:09,"I am unable to take out a sword
that has a spell on it."
1,1,560,00:54:08:21,00:54:11:03,"You cannot even take out
your own father's sword."
1,1,561,00:54:11:05,00:54:12:21,How do you expect to learn spells?
1,1,562,00:54:12:23,00:54:15:20,"Why can you not open my gate of energy
so I can practice casting spells?"
1,1,563,00:54:15:22,00:54:16:20,I…
1,1,564,00:54:18:01,00:54:19:10,cannot do that.
1,1,565,00:54:20:19,00:54:24:05,Then find me another master.
1,1,566,00:54:24:23,00:54:26:08,No master can do that.
1,1,567,00:54:27:06,00:54:29:18,"No one in Daeho will be able
to go against your father"
1,1,568,00:54:29:20,00:54:31:18,and open your gate of energy.
1,1,569,00:54:31:20,00:54:33:06,Then are you saying
1,1,570,00:54:34:05,00:54:36:02,"I will never have
the ability to practice spells?"
1,1,571,00:54:36:04,00:54:37:03,That was
1,1,572,00:54:37:05,00:54:41:10,the fate given to you by your father.
1,1,573,00:54:42:09,00:54:44:05,Why!
1,1,574,00:54:44:08,00:54:46:06,Why would he decide my own fate?
1,1,575,00:54:47:12,00:54:49:21,"No one even considers him
as my true father anyway!"
1,1,576,00:54:51:10,00:54:52:21,I will find someone.
1,1,577,00:54:53:23,00:54:57:24,"A master who will open my gate of energy
and teach me how to practice spells."
1,1,578,00:54:58:19,00:55:00:14,I will find someone myself.
1,1,579,00:55:01:24,00:55:04:08,"Then I will take out that sword
and break it in two."
1,1,580,00:55:30:14,00:55:33:00,"I heard Young Master Jang
got expelled again."
1,1,581,00:55:33:17,00:55:36:22,"Why would the son of the great Lord Jang
always get in so much trouble?"
1,1,582,00:55:37:00,00:55:38:17,He is not his son.
1,1,583,00:55:38:19,00:55:41:03,"Do-hwa, the most beautiful woman in Daeho,"
1,1,584,00:55:41:05,00:55:43:14,slept with another man and had Jang Uk.
1,1,585,00:55:44:04,00:55:45:20,I doubt that rumor is true.
1,1,586,00:55:45:22,00:55:48:24,"Then why would he block his son
from casting spells"
1,1,587,00:55:49:01,00:55:50:24,and live his life like a vagabond?
1,1,588,00:55:51:24,00:55:56:00,"I wonder if he is really weak
because his father put a spell on him."
1,1,589,00:56:05:18,00:56:07:17,"The Spirit Plaque should be
here somewhere."
1,1,590,00:56:22:00,00:56:23:11,Where is it?
1,1,591,00:56:48:20,00:56:50:19,Why did I have to hide here?
1,1,592,00:56:50:21,00:56:52:11,What will he think of me?
1,1,593,00:56:53:09,00:56:54:15,What should I say to him?
1,1,594,00:57:01:03,00:57:03:19,"This was not what I had in mind
when I brought you here."
1,1,595,00:57:05:19,00:57:06:15,Well…
1,1,596,00:57:07:08,00:57:09:23,"You kept saying you were cold,"
1,1,597,00:57:10:00,00:57:12:01,so I was just heating the bedding for you.
1,1,598,00:57:12:03,00:57:15:00,"If you lie down right away,
it will be nice and warm all night."
1,1,599,00:57:15:02,00:57:16:06,Is that so?
1,1,600,00:57:17:21,00:57:19:00,How kind of you.
1,1,601,00:57:23:11,00:57:25:16,"-Good night, then.
-Where are you going?"
1,1,602,00:57:27:20,00:57:29:04,You came to keep me warm.
1,1,603,00:57:30:23,00:57:32:06,Keep my bed
1,1,604,00:57:32:22,00:57:34:00,nice and hot
1,1,605,00:57:35:09,00:57:36:12,all night long.
1,1,606,00:57:38:14,00:57:39:18,Heat it up.
1,1,607,00:57:44:00,00:57:47:04,What? Does he really like me?
1,1,608,00:57:47:06,00:57:48:21,Have I fallen for his tricks?
1,1,609,00:57:57:05,00:57:58:02,Young Master…
1,1,610,00:57:59:01,00:58:01:16,"My body is not warm enough
to keep you warm."
1,1,611,00:58:01:18,00:58:03:18,"Ever since I was young,
I easily got the chills."
1,1,612,00:58:03:20,00:58:06:14,So my body temperature is always very low.
1,1,613,00:58:13:14,00:58:14:19,All right.
1,1,614,00:58:28:10,00:58:31:11,"I do not plan on doing
what you want me to do."
1,1,615,00:58:41:07,00:58:43:17,Bring the brazier closer to me.
1,1,616,00:58:47:14,00:58:48:18,The brazier?
1,1,617,00:58:49:07,00:58:52:09,"I just wanted you to bring
the brazier near my bed"
1,1,618,00:58:52:11,00:58:53:13,and keep it hot.
1,1,619,00:58:57:21,00:58:59:08,Keep it hot.
1,1,620,00:59:05:23,00:59:06:20,Here.
1,1,621,00:59:07:10,00:59:09:07,This is too close.
1,1,622,00:59:10:15,00:59:12:02,It will be too hot.
1,1,623,00:59:12:24,00:59:14:24,"Oh, right. It will be too hot."
1,1,624,00:59:18:23,00:59:20:20,I will sell you if the fire goes out.
1,1,625,00:59:20:22,00:59:22:12,Keep the fire alive all night.
1,1,626,00:59:22:15,00:59:23:18,"All right, Young Master."
1,1,627,00:59:35:15,00:59:38:23,All right. Dang-gu is here.
1,1,628,00:59:42:11,00:59:44:16,What is that? It is a whistle.
1,1,629,00:59:45:10,00:59:46:06,Yes.
1,1,630,00:59:47:05,00:59:48:21,I swear I made this.
1,1,631,00:59:48:24,00:59:52:04,"Oh, right. I remember.
You used to have a pet bird."
1,1,632,00:59:52:06,00:59:54:02,Why? Are you planning to get a new one?
1,1,633,00:59:55:10,00:59:56:15,"No, not exactly."
1,1,634,00:59:56:17,00:59:58:15,I just found this on someone unexpected.
1,1,635,00:59:59:20,01:00:02:01,I wonder why she had it.
1,1,636,01:00:02:03,01:00:03:08,Maybe you gave it to her.
1,1,637,01:00:03:23,01:00:06:00,Maybe you forgot that you gave it to her.
1,1,638,01:00:06:02,01:00:07:04,No.
1,1,639,01:00:08:01,01:00:10:08,I clearly remember who I gave this to.
1,1,640,01:00:27:11,01:00:30:06,Then go ask her.
1,1,641,01:00:37:02,01:00:39:21,You are going to go at this hour?
1,1,642,01:00:39:23,01:00:41:08,I need to check something.
1,1,643,01:02:36:14,01:02:38:01,Who are those guys?
1,1,644,01:02:53:19,01:02:55:00,Intruders!
1,1,645,01:02:55:18,01:02:57:11,We have intruders!
1,1,646,01:02:57:13,01:02:58:20,Intruders!
1,1,647,01:03:57:07,01:03:58:13,Go on.
1,1,648,01:04:29:14,01:04:30:15,Out of the way!
1,1,649,01:05:11:03,01:05:13:18,"Yul, what is going on?"
1,1,650,01:05:17:08,01:05:18:19,The Training Center is on fire.
1,1,651,01:05:26:18,01:05:28:11,Who is at Jeongjingak?
1,1,652,01:05:28:13,01:05:30:01,Master Yul and Dang-gu.
1,1,653,01:05:33:06,01:05:34:15,"Uncle, are you all right?"
1,1,654,01:05:35:21,01:05:37:01,The intruders all left.
1,1,655,01:05:39:05,01:05:40:23,Jeongjingak is empty.
1,1,656,01:05:51:17,01:05:53:02,"-Find them.
-Yes, my lord."
1,1,657,01:06:03:14,01:06:05:05,Who were those guys?
1,1,658,01:06:06:05,01:06:08:03,Did the Danju send them here?
1,1,659,01:06:11:05,01:06:14:14,"The soul you need to collect this time
is Park Jin, the leader of Songrim."
1,1,660,01:06:18:09,01:06:19:12,Right.
1,1,661,01:06:20:15,01:06:22:20,"He must have sent them here
to retrieve my body."
1,1,662,01:06:30:17,01:06:31:23,Who is there?
1,1,663,01:07:05:03,01:07:06:00,Young Master?
1,1,664,01:07:20:06,01:07:21:17,What are you doing here?
1,1,665,01:07:25:03,01:07:26:10,Because of your eyes.
1,1,666,01:07:27:14,01:07:28:11,My eyes?
1,1,667,01:07:51:03,01:07:52:19,I knew the moment I saw you.
1,1,668,01:07:55:11,01:07:56:21,You are my master.
