1
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:48,339
Bu-yeon, is this where you felt
the energy of the sparkling stone?

2
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:49,549
Father.

3
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:50,842
We are close.

4
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:55,472
The pretty stone is
somewhere underwater nearby.

5
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,190
Do you really think
what she found is the ice stone?

6
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:06,858
Yes, it has to be it.

7
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:09,486
Ten years ago, my master, Jang Gang,

8
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,197
sealed the ice stone here
at Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.

9
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,200
And now it has been found
by the girl who was born

10
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,577
through the great power of the ice stone.

11
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:22,665
I am sure that
Bu-yeon is Jang Gang's daughter.

12
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:26,002
It explains why he performed sorcery
to save her.

13
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,339
Do you resent her?

14
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:40,475
Thanks to that girl,

15
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:43,686
a good-for-nothing man like me
was able to marry

16
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,148
the daughter of the Jin family.

17
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,944
So I guess I should be grateful.

18
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:57,867
This is the place.
The pretty stone is right underneath us.

19
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:12,507
Her father's inferiority complex
and jealousy

20
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,343
were what led Jin Bu-yeon to her death.

21
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,055
It suits you well.

22
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:23,309
If you like it,
then I like it too, Mother.

23
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,063
You should try on something else.

24
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,277
Jin Bu-yeon's immense divine powers

25
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:35,405
not only came from her mother,
a member of the Jin family.

26
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:40,785
They also came from her father,
a descendant of the fallen Choi family.

27
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:47,167
The Choi siblings, who made a living
by performing curses and divinations,

28
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,628
were descendants of Mage Choi,
the very first mage to perform

29
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,463
the alchemy of souls.

30
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:57,468
Jin Bu-yeon was
a descendant of both families,

31
00:02:57,552 --> 00:03:01,222
which enabled her to become
the best priestess anyone had ever seen.

32
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,142
You have finally found it.

33
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:06,226
Bu-yeon.

34
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,021
Hand over the ice stone to me.

35
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,367
Hand it over!

36
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:27,707
Bu-yeon…

37
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,084
Bu-yeon!

38
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,046
Bu-yeon!

39
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,740
Eat up.

40
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:03,243
Here. Hold the spoon.

41
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,537
It is bad enough that you are blind.

42
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:09,332
It is pitiful that
you cannot even remember your name.

43
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,920
Would you like to live with me?

44
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:18,549
My late granddaughter's name was Mu-deok.

45
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:19,801
Can I call you Mu-deok?

46
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,888
All right.

47
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,515
Your name is Mu-deok from now on.

48
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,059
Such a lovely girl.

49
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:30,019
Go ahead and eat.

50
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,443
Mu-deok.

51
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,237
Mother.

52
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,204
Bu-yeon.

53
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:46,888
How is this possible?

54
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,642
This is exactly what happened
the day Jin Bu-yeon disappeared.

55
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:06,157
Mu-deok has not returned.

56
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,619
Both Uk and Mu-deok
must have been killed by the soul shifter.

57
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,038
At this rate, the rest of us will die too.

58
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,587
Jin Bu-yeon.

59
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,381
You brought the ice stone
from Jinyowon yourself.

60
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:25,384
You are a priestess.
Are you unable to control it?

61
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,639
I just did what my mother told me to do
and brought it here.

62
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,724
You are pathetic.

63
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:36,104
Young Master Seo has lost too much blood.

64
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:39,440
Without a blood transfusion,
his life will be in danger.

65
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,610
If you need someone's blood,
you can use mine.

66
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:44,987
We are unable to use spells in here,

67
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,906
so your blood cannot be shared.

68
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:55,832
Give me your hand.

69
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,594
The worm that sucked the blood
of my daughter, Cho-yeon,

70
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,472
will enter your body
and give you the power of the Jin family.

71
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:18,312
Jang Uk has made a fool of us
with his lie.

72
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:23,943
The mages of the Unanimous Assembly have
taken turns reading Words of the Heart,

73
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:26,028
and it says nothing about the ice stone.

74
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,739
It is nothing more than a piece of poetry.

75
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,162
What does Songrim have to say about this?

76
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:38,624
All the mages may have read it,

77
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,711
but there is something no one knows.

78
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,888
Words of the Heart is
a letter of confession

79
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,306
written by Master Seo Gyeong.

80
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:56,100
It was a letter?

81
00:07:56,684 --> 00:08:00,229
It was a love letter
written to Jin Seol-ran,

82
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,772
the first leader of Jinyowon.

83
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:07,278
It is a letter confessing that
he did not destroy the ice stone

84
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:11,407
because he could not let go
of his dying lover.

85
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,411
Are you saying Master Seo Gyeong

86
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,831
chose not to destroy the ice stone
because of love?

87
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,459
He is just making things up.

88
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:25,630
I can prove that it is a love letter.

89
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:30,025
All you need to do is say the name
of the recipient in your head,

90
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,971
and it will enable you to read
the letter yourself, Your Majesty.

91
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,765
I can read Words of the Heart

92
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,559
even though I am not a skilled mage?

93
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:40,603
The name of the recipient

94
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:44,982
reminds you of a fresh orchid
that blooms on a cold field of snow.

95
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,402
It is Seol-ran.

96
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,113
"Seol-ran"?

97
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:26,857
"The faint, blue light…"

98
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:38,786
"My heart aches to see
my beautiful flower wither."

99
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,038
"And in the end,

100
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:44,917
I am a fool who dares not shed

101
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,296
a single tear."

102
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,300
It is his confession

103
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,803
saying he left the ice stone unharmed
to save his lover.

104
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,434
But Lady Jin Seol-ran passed away

105
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,519
less than six months

106
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:07,982
after Jinyowon was established
due to her injury during the Great Chaos.

107
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,483
If it was left for her,

108
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,736
then why did she not use it
to save herself?

109
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:16,157
I believe she chose not to use it
because she did not want the world

110
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,576
to be exposed to such dangerous power.

111
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:23,205
What human would choose
to give up on such immense power?

112
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,707
A man like you

113
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,210
would never choose to do what she did.

114
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:31,005
However, she did it for mankind.

115
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:33,633
She did what was right.

116
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,803
To protect what we must…

117
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:45,519
one must sometimes choose
to let go of everything.

118
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,163
Since you have unsheathed the sword,

119
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,291
make your decision.

120
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,547
I know you have been avoiding me.

121
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,634
I also know that everyone's lives
are in your hands.

122
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:22,640
Like you promised,
point your sword at me first.

123
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,987
Overflowing power means

124
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,740
you will not be able to control
how much of it you use.

125
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:43,327
Desire rain, and you will get a flood.

126
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,664
Desire wind, and you will get a typhoon.

127
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:48,416
Try to endure it.

128
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:51,377
Does that mean
I have no control over this power?

129
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,506
There is one thing you can do
of your own free will,

130
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:58,926
which is to not use it.

131
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:03,556
It is up to you
to choose not to use that power.

132
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:19,238
Make me another promise

133
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:22,950
just like you said you would.

134
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:41,010
Among the many stars,

135
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:44,388
there is a very sad one
called the King's Star.

136
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,684
What is the King's Star?

137
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:50,728
A star that is given to those

138
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:53,105
who are permitted
to use the energy of the heavens.

139
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,774
Does that mean
that person becomes powerful?

140
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,526
That means it is a good thing.

141
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:01,864
Well, I would not say
it is necessarily always a good thing.

142
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,908
With great power

143
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:05,951
comes great responsibilities.

144
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,995
What are responsibilities?

145
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:10,539
It means you must also do things
you do not wish to do,

146
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,875
which can be very distressing and lonely.

147
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,504
Mister, can we eat that?

148
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:18,713
Sure.

149
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:22,635
- I shall give this to you.
- Thank you.

150
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:26,388
In return, make sure
you do not fight over it.

151
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,057
All right. Let us go now.

152
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:40,152
The star will appear soon.

153
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:44,198
Then those leaving shall leave,

154
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:46,825
and those returning shall return.

155
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:57,670
This is the place that
the Crown Prince was looking for.

156
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,381
The apothecary where Eunuch Kim,

157
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:02,841
the man who served the queen,
visited every month.

158
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,177
You really know how to find your way.

159
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:08,347
Remember the charm
that helps two people become lovers?

160
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,950
Did you get that at Gaema Village too?

161
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:14,061
That charm did not even work.
Stop teasing me about that.

162
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:18,107
What do you mean it did not work?
Look at us. We are here together.

163
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:20,441
I mean…

164
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:23,237
We are not here on a date.

165
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:34,915
Why is he here?

166
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:39,169
APOTHECARY

167
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,380
Father?

168
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,670
You must have regained consciousness.

169
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,340
You have tried to harm yourself
once again, Your Highness.

170
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,508
Why are you keeping me alive?

171
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,428
Please just kill me.

172
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:32,723
I cannot do that yet.
The Queen's Lantern of Life

173
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:36,393
must continue to glow
while the Queen's body stays alive.

174
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:42,358
It disturbs me to see you
glare at me like that

175
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,861
with the face of my sister.

176
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,197
Your resentment should not
be directed toward me.

177
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,074
Resent the man

178
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,285
who put me and my sister in this position.

179
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,716
Shaman Choi, you have cursed
and harmed people

180
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,843
by performing prohibited divinations.

181
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,304
Do you admit to your sins?

182
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:21,689
I was merely paid
to give people what they wanted.

183
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:25,401
The ones at fault are those
who asked me to curse others.

184
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,319
Your curse has led to someone's death!

185
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,239
Yet you still plead innocence?

186
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:36,620
A divination strong enough
to kill someone…

187
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,247
I am amazed by your divine powers.

188
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:39,999
It just might be

189
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:45,379
strong enough to even kill you.

190
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:54,680
Find every single spell book and tool
that was used to perform evil divinations.

191
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:55,963
- Yes, my lord!
- Yes, my lord!

192
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,825
No, not that!

193
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:16,952
We may be a lowly family,

194
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,038
but that is our family heirloom.

195
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,415
I did not use it to perform divinations!

196
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:22,666
So please do not burn it!

197
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,418
CHEONGANG

198
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:25,669
It is a spell book.

199
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:26,795
No…

200
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:28,588
Burn it.

201
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:35,179
No!

202
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,097
CHEONGANG

203
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,032
Put out the fire. Now!

204
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,315
- Yes, my lord!
- Yes, my lord!

205
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:07,002
CHEONGANG

206
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,304
THE ALCHEMY OF SOULS

207
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,431
"The alchemy of souls"?

208
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,947
Hang in there, my sister.

209
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,175
Everything began with him.

210
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,819
He put those scars on my sister's face.

211
00:18:56,885 --> 00:19:00,055
He is the reason why my sister
shifted her soul into your body.

212
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,141
It is all his fault.

213
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,726
Jang Gang.

214
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,563
Jang…

215
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,065
Gang…

216
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,068
You cannot pass away just yet.

217
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,737
Stay alive in my sister's body

218
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,240
for just a bit longer,

219
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,284
Your Highness.

220
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,167
It has been more than ten years
since I entered this body.

221
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:32,671
But whenever her consciousness returns,
it still puts a toll on me.

222
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,633
If not for the Lantern of Life,
I would have killed her already.

223
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:39,261
Your brother went to her
to feed her the potion.

224
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,264
So you will feel better soon.

225
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:44,683
But…

226
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:48,729
How did the ice stone
end up at Jeongjingak?

227
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:50,522
Jin Ho-gyeong probably made a mistake

228
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,649
since it was her first time
handling the ice stone.

229
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,110
When the timing is right,

230
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,947
I will gather the power of the ice stone
using the alchemy of souls.

231
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,536
If you do that now,
everyone in Jeongjingak will die.

232
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,746
Yes, I know.

233
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,873
The Crown Prince is there too.

234
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:10,876
So?

235
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,963
You must wait
until the Crown Prince safely gets out.

236
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,465
Then you can collect its power.

237
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:17,925
What if he cannot get out?

238
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,053
Am I just supposed to wait and do nothing?

239
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:24,640
What if someone else
takes its power before I do?

240
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:28,310
Fortunately, no one is doing anything
because everyone is on their guard.

241
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:33,482
First, we must find a way
to save the Crown Prince.

242
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:48,789
Mother.

243
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,713
I must have misheard her.

244
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:59,132
Why would she call me "Mother"?

245
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,176
That is ridiculous.

246
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,101
People…

247
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,938
seem more concerned about the ice stone…

248
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,442
than the kids who are trapped
inside the barrier.

249
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,947
The two of us should try
and break the barrier.

250
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:26,576
If we do anything
without the Unanimous Assembly's consent,

251
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,996
there will be another fight.

252
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:33,250
The ice stone belongs to Jinyowon.

253
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,961
Songrim no longer has the right
to make decisions about it.

254
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:37,087
Lady Jin.

255
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:41,466
Is it true that the ice stone
never left the walls of Jinyowon

256
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,844
for the past 200 years?

257
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:49,182
You once told me that a Songrim mage
once entered Jinyowon.

258
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:50,976
By any chance,

259
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,229
was it Jang Gang?

260
00:21:58,233 --> 00:21:59,943
I asked you a question.

261
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:04,698
Did Jang Gang ever get his hands
on the ice stone?

262
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:18,128
The baby inside me is not moving.

263
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:19,921
I had her inside me for 13 months.

264
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:21,997
I cannot let her go like this.

265
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:25,510
I must save her.

266
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,846
I am sorry.

267
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,599
She is already dead.

268
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,105
Inside Jinyowon

269
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:39,815
lies the ice stone.

270
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,070
The ice stone?

271
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:45,572
Why act so startled?
You presumed it would be there.

272
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:48,992
You asked me to let you inside Jinyowon
on numerous occasions.

273
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:52,454
I know it was because you wanted
to look for the ice stone.

274
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,667
I heard the ice stone has the power

275
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:01,797
to bring back the souls of the dead.

276
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,382
I am not powerful enough…

277
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,803
to control the ice stone.

278
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:09,721
But you, Jang Gang,

279
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:12,682
might have what it takes.

280
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:16,937
Are you telling me to perform sorcery?

281
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,689
I will do anything to save my baby!

282
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:23,484
Please.

283
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,822
Please help me save this baby.

284
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:41,294
That night, I opened the doors of Jinyowon
and let him inside

285
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,214
in the hopes of saving the dead baby
inside me.

286
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:48,885
And as a consequence,
Jinyowon ended up losing the ice stone.

287
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,562
Even if that was the case,

288
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:01,815
Songrim is more at fault.

289
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:05,443
A Songrim mage,
who always pretended to be righteous,

290
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:07,362
took the ice stone

291
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:10,866
and caused havoc by using it
to perform the alchemy of souls.

292
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:15,662
That is why I wanted to hide it.

293
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,123
However,

294
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:22,544
I will do what I can to reveal the truth
and set things right,

295
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:26,131
even if it requires me to expose
Songrim's wrongdoings…

296
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,301
and reprimand those at fault.

297
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:36,725
Then you will have to reprimand
the person you cherish as well.

298
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:40,437
It will not be easy.

299
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,690
I know.

300
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:47,067
But…

301
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:51,990
if that is the only way
to rectify the situation,

302
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,579
then I will do so.

303
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:09,591
My sister will shift her soul
from your body

304
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:13,595
to the body of a girl who is
pretending to be my eldest daughter.

305
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:15,972
Once that happens,

306
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:19,643
I will do as you wish and kill you.

307
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:35,951
Cho-yeon.

308
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:39,204
What…

309
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,622
What are you doing here?

310
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:44,626
Father.

311
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:46,836
What…

312
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:49,965
in the world…

313
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:52,384
did I just hear?

314
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:59,766
Who is that woman?

315
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:03,186
Does the soul inside that body…

316
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,440
truly belong to the Queen?

317
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:39,306
Father, stop.

318
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:42,202
My lord.

319
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,454
Is that you?

320
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:55,256
Maidservant Kim.

321
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:57,675
It has been a long time.

322
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:03,181
Master Jang.

323
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,597
It is the soul shifter.

324
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,769
Uk must have defeated him.

325
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:51,513
It only took a single stroke.

326
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:55,859
We cannot use spells in here.
How did he manage to kill him?

327
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,904
Where are Uk and Mu-deok?

328
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,072
Find them.

329
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:03,032
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

330
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:16,921
I saw an illusion when I first received
the energy of the ice stone.

331
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:20,467
She told me that no one can
truly own the ice stone

332
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,218
and that you can only use its power.

333
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:24,971
Because it is the power of the sky.

334
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,390
We need to train ourselves

335
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:31,144
to even be able to control
the energy within us.

336
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:34,105
The energy of the sky
is surely way beyond our reach.

337
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:38,526
I guess it means we are unable
to use it freely because it is not ours.

338
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:42,739
If one cannot own it…

339
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:45,408
What if I give it all away?

340
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,494
Give it all away?

341
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:51,206
What if I give all my energy
to the energy of the sky?

342
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:54,250
Then my energy will become
the energy of the sky.

343
00:29:57,837 --> 00:29:59,964
I read records about the ice stone

344
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,925
inside the secret library in Jeongjingak.

345
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:06,638
It said the ice stone has
no shape or form.

346
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:09,557
Thus, it can be water, fire, or wind.

347
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,851
It is impossible to know its size.

348
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:15,271
Thus, it can be
both minuscule or enormous.

349
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:20,276
That means the fog
surrounding Jeongjingak like a barrier

350
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,195
is not the actual form of the ice stone.

351
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:24,781
So it can turn into water or fire,

352
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:27,575
and it can also become bigger
or smaller than this?

353
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,369
That is right.

354
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:32,997
Then do you think
we can turn the fog into rain?

355
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:34,624
Rain?

356
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:37,544
You told me that I was incapable
of beating the ice stone

357
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,105
because I could only gather
a single water drop at most.

358
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:44,634
But what if that water drop
turns into thousands of raindrops?

359
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:48,721
Then it will turn into rain.

360
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,348
It might work.

361
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:53,142
But to do that, you need to use Tansu.

362
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:55,562
- Then…
- Then I will lose all my energy.

363
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:59,732
That is why I said
I must give it all away.

364
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:04,904
No.

365
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,698
Let us think of another way.

366
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:09,659
If we wait and the Queen gathers
the power of the ice stone,

367
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,828
we will all die.

368
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:15,665
She will not be able to do anything rash
with the Unanimous Assembly there.

369
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,793
Uk, I do not want you to do this.

370
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:21,045
As your master, that is an order.

371
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:32,432
I may have given up
on acquiring this power,

372
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:34,225
but I cannot let you lose it all too.

373
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:37,729
It took us so much effort to get this far.

374
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,148
I had to push you again and again,

375
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,817
and you risked your life many times
to come this far.

376
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:51,868
How could you be willing to lose it all
for a single drop of water?

377
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:57,081
Yul is severely injured.

378
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,792
If we do not do anything, he will die.

379
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:06,841
Mu-deok.

380
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:10,637
You gave up what you wanted
because you wanted to protect me.

381
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,516
I am trying to protect as well.

382
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:20,438
And Yul has also been
protecting you all along.

383
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:34,035
Without a blood transfusion,
his life will be in danger.

384
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:39,958
This worm sucked the blood
of a member of the Jin family.

385
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,668
If I give this to him…

386
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:19,998
Do not die, Young Master Seo.

387
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,001
Please stay alive.

388
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,992
Put away the Soul Ejector.
What if someone sees it?

389
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,619
I cannot endure this any longer.

390
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,997
I must retrieve the ice stone at once

391
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,249
with the help of the Soul Ejector.

392
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:06,919
Have you lost your mind?

393
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,814
You cannot perform sorcery
with the Soul Ejector

394
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:10,506
when the Unanimous Assembly is here.

395
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,217
Sorcery?

396
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:19,098
This Soul Ejector was made
from the ice stone.

397
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:22,077
Yet the ice stone is considered good
while the Soul Ejector is considered evil.

398
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:24,228
How ridiculous is that?

399
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:28,316
You may think it is ridiculous,
but that is the order of this world.

400
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,152
We are doing this
so you can emerge from the darkness

401
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:33,696
without being defamed
as someone who performs sorcery.

402
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:35,448
Defame?

403
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:39,911
You came this far with the help
of my family's alchemy of souls.

404
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:42,538
How dare you treat it with disdain?

405
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:50,254
I am merely saying the alchemy of souls
is a spell that is unacknowledged.

406
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:54,092
Why must the world acknowledge it?

407
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,970
When we found the ice stone
at Lake Gyeongcheondaeho ten years ago,

408
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:01,682
we could have used the power of sorcery
to rise under the Choi family name.

409
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:02,767
However,

410
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:05,937
you insisted that I enter the Queen's body

411
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,314
and formed a secret organization
in Cheonbugwan.

412
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:09,565
And now,

413
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:14,362
you insist on revealing the ice stone
to the world through Jinyowon.

414
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:19,742
That was because it was too dangerous
to go against the world with sorcery.

415
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:23,663
It was not that it was dangerous.
You just despised it.

416
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:26,624
You did not want to be stigmatized
for using sorcery.

417
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:30,837
You just wanted to wield your power
as everyone worshipped you.

418
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:36,676
Why are you so desperate
to be acknowledged?

419
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:41,931
Is it because you still cannot get over
the fact that you were born

420
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:45,893
due to your father's dirty affair
and were never truly acknowledged

421
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:51,357
as a true member of the Jin family,
which made you run around like a dog?

422
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:10,001
The royal position of Queen
must have become burdensome

423
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:14,297
for someone who used to make a living
off of performing crude divinations.

424
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:23,431
If it is so hard to bear,
I will get you a few living souls.

425
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:28,019
Feed off their souls
and get your act together.

426
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:58,382
You found the Queen's soul?

427
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:03,179
Did you bring her to Songrim?

428
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:04,262
Yes.

429
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:06,140
She is with Young Lady Jin.

430
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:10,728
Bring her to the Training Center.

431
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:12,571
I will reveal the truth
in front of everyone.

432
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,190
No, my lord.

433
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:18,027
You must only tell the royal family
and the people of Jinyowon.

434
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:23,616
You are the heir of Songrim,

435
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:27,495
yet you stand there
worrying about the reputation of Jinyowon?

436
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:30,790
I will not deny that.

437
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:35,795
But Songrim also seems
to hold responsibility in this matter.

438
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:41,175
A Songrim mage was the start of all this.

439
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:44,262
A Songrim mage? Who?

440
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:48,849
Jang Uk's father, Gwanju Jang Gang.

441
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:10,288
Based on Songrim's request,

442
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:13,541
I have sent everyone away
but the mages of Cheonbugwan and Jinyowon.

443
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,585
What is that you have to tell us?

444
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:22,633
I heard the Crown Prince has been
looking for someone recently.

445
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:25,428
Park Dang-gu, a mage of Jeongjingak,

446
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:28,681
and Jin Cho-yeon, a priestess of Jinyowon,
have found that person.

447
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,059
The Crown Prince has been
looking for someone?

448
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:34,478
Who may that be?

449
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:38,649
She is here with us.

450
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:44,905
I heard someone threw a rock

451
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,700
that said the ice stone takes away
their energy to cast spells.

452
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:50,745
The ice stone takes away
their power to cast spells?

453
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:53,205
It is the power used
in the alchemy of souls.

454
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:56,667
I guess it sucks out spell-casting energy
just like how it does with souls.

455
00:38:56,751 --> 00:39:00,338
Then what is going to happen to our kids?

456
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:02,631
You were all so eager to kill someone

457
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:05,301
just so you could see its power.

458
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:07,261
And now you are scared?

459
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:11,766
The power of the ice stone
cannot be controlled by humans.

460
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,685
That is why Songrim
insisted on destroying it.

461
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,812
Then Songrim should take action.

462
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,315
My son is in there.

463
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:20,858
So is my granddaughter.

464
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,236
If I knew what to do,
I would not be just standing here.

465
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:27,114
Everyone here coveted

466
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,533
the power of the heavens,
and look what that led to.

467
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:32,745
I fear this will cause
many people to die again,

468
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:35,581
just as what happened 200 years ago
during the Great Chaos.

469
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:37,249
Seo Gyeong…

470
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,252
Master Seo Gyeong
got rid of the ice stone.

471
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:44,215
Did he leave anything behind
other than Words of the Heart?

472
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:48,177
Words of the Heart
was the only thing he left behind.

473
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,472
We summoned the power of the ice stone,

474
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:54,183
so someone among us must undo it

475
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:57,686
just like what Master Seo Gyeong did
many years ago.

476
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,946
You are going to use rain
to get rid of the ice stone's energy?

477
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,824
I cannot be sure if it will rain

478
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:13,077
and whether or not
that rain will get rid of the barrier.

479
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:15,454
One thing is for sure.

480
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:17,957
If you use Tansu in here,

481
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,000
you will lose

482
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,920
all of your ability to cast spells.

483
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:25,423
I know.

484
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,007
Yet you are willing to try?

485
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:32,179
You may not be a high-level mage,

486
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:35,724
but you still went through a lot
to get this far.

487
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:37,935
Are you fine with losing it all?

488
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:42,690
I will deal with that.

489
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,359
But I need you to help me deal
with something else.

490
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:49,697
If the ice stone disappears,

491
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:53,200
I need you to deal with what comes next.

492
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,456
Those who coveted its power
will become resentful.

493
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:02,209
They might even get suspicious
and think it was hidden somewhere.

494
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:06,505
So you want me to act like
I was the one who hid the ice stone

495
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:08,716
and to deal with the consequences?

496
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:12,052
Are you telling me
to take credit for what you did?

497
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,180
I am asking you to clean up

498
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:16,974
after the mess I will be causing.

499
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:23,147
Jang Uk.

500
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:26,168
Not only could you lose your powers,
but you could also die.

501
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,985
Stop being stupid and just forget it.

502
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,907
My master

503
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:36,660
always pushed me to the edge of a cliff
and said this to me.

504
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:40,664
"It is better to die than to do nothing."

505
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,754
I will be trying something
not out of stupidity, but out of vigor.

506
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,548
Just as my master has taught me.

507
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:55,721
I did not know you had a master.

508
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:59,642
Who is it? Is it Master Lee Cheol?

509
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:02,686
Young Master.

510
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:07,650
I brought the sword.

511
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:15,448
Filthy Mu-deok.

512
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:19,537
Are you not going to stop him
from being so reckless?

513
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:24,667
It is better to die than to do nothing.

514
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:29,504
Young Master.

515
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:32,508
Do what you must.

516
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:34,134
And…

517
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:36,637
I hope you succeed.

518
00:42:55,114 --> 00:43:00,119
The person who is about to step inside
is in an incredibly terrible state.

519
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:02,037
Twenty years ago,

520
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:05,499
she burned herself as she tried to escape
the patrol of Cheonbugwan.

521
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:13,549
She was a shaman who performed divinations

522
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:16,051
and cursed people.

523
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:20,431
A shaman?

524
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:24,977
She was locked up like a beast
for a very long time,

525
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:28,647
inside a tiny room
near an apothecary in Gaema Village.

526
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:33,944
Why was she locked up?

527
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:36,196
I requested you to assemble this meeting

528
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:39,325
in hopes to find that out, Your Majesty.

529
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:42,620
Everyone here is

530
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:48,167
somewhat related to Shaman Choi,
the woman who will soon enter this room.

531
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,212
- Everyone?
- Your Majesty.

532
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,632
Now is not the time for this.

533
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:56,759
Deal with the ice stone first.

534
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:58,882
This can wait
until the Crown Prince safely returns.

535
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:10,105
Leader of Songrim, bring the shaman here.

536
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:16,987
Please come inside.

537
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:08,038
Shaman Choi, show your face.

538
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:36,984
Your Majesty.

539
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:43,490
Never in my dreams did I think
I would be able to see your face again.

540
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,327
Do you know me?

541
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:50,330
I am your wife, Your Majesty.

542
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:54,084
I am Seo Ha-seon, the Queen of Daeho.

543
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:56,044
Shut your mouth!

544
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:59,256
How dare you speak my name
with that filthy mouth of yours?

545
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:01,675
I am the Queen of this country!

546
00:46:01,758 --> 00:46:03,343
How dare you!

547
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:05,679
You did this to me.

548
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:09,600
You, a lowly shaman,
used the wicked alchemy of souls

549
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:12,227
to shift your filthy soul…

550
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:17,816
into my sacred body,
the body of the Queen!

551
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,735
I have had enough of your lies.

552
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:22,082
Assistant Gwanju, do not just stand there.

553
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:24,198
Shut that crazy woman up right now.

554
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:30,370
First, we will have to check

555
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,748
whether or not she is lying.

556
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:35,292
Fine.

557
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:38,170
She says her soul was shifted,

558
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:41,465
so let us check if the Queen
has a blue mark on her body.

559
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:50,057
I will gladly show it to you
to help you get rid of your suspicions.

560
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:04,112
Should I reveal my shoulder here?

561
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:08,408
The blue mark can easily be removed.

562
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:10,052
Then there is no other way to prove it.

563
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:15,207
There is Gwigu.

564
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:25,592
I have the ashes

565
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:30,806
of the dog Gwigu was in
that was cremated recently.

566
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:34,935
What remains of Gwigu's powers
will help us…

567
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,440
reveal the truth.

568
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:47,906
No!

569
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:54,162
No!

570
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:02,421
You see,

571
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,506
those were…

572
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:07,509
simply ashes collected

573
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:09,970
from a brazier.

574
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,736
You just proved to us yourself

575
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,823
that you are a soul shifter.

576
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:41,043
I order you to drag out Shaman Choi

577
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:45,339
who used the wicked
alchemy of souls to take over

578
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:46,715
the Queen's body!

579
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:47,998
- Yes, my lord!
- Yes, my lord!

580
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:49,635
No!

581
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:55,932
Do not harm her. That is my body.

582
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:59,936
My soul must return to that body.
Do not let her harm it.

583
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:02,648
Do not come close.

584
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:08,278
Otherwise, I will
destroy this body to pieces.

585
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:10,739
She is a descendant of Mage Choi,

586
00:49:10,822 --> 00:49:14,076
the man who caused
the Great Chaos 200 years ago.

587
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:18,705
And she was most likely the one
who created the Soul Ejectors,

588
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:22,125
which explains the recent appearances
of soul shifters.

589
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:25,128
This evil performer of sorcery

590
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:27,798
revealed the ice stone
in front of the Unanimous Assembly

591
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,342
and made a complete fool

592
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,345
of all the mages in Daeho.

593
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:37,766
The royal family,
Cheonbugwan, and Jinyowon

594
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:40,394
have all been fooled

595
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:45,524
by the Choi siblings this whole time.

596
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:48,110
"Siblings"?

597
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,576
Honey, does this mean

598
00:49:57,703 --> 00:50:01,123
you and that shaman are siblings?

599
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,462
You are a member of the Choi family?

600
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:16,888
Yes, I am.

601
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:22,519
I am sorry.

602
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:28,316
Jin Bu-yeon,
the daughter you recently found,

603
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,026
is also a fake

604
00:50:31,236 --> 00:50:32,362
made by them.

605
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:37,868
It turns out her next plan was
to shift souls into the body

606
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:40,287
of Jinyowon's heir.

607
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:53,633
Shaman Choi.

608
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:55,302
Put down the dagger

609
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:58,346
and return that body
to Her Highness the Queen.

610
00:50:58,430 --> 00:50:59,639
Do as I say,

611
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:05,395
and I will spare your brother's life.

612
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:19,409
You say I am evil.

613
00:51:22,078 --> 00:51:23,705
But no one here

614
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:27,793
deserves to call me that.

615
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:30,754
Do you want to know

616
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:34,633
how I managed to take over
the sacred body of the Queen?

617
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:40,972
She gladly gave up her body to me
because she wanted to shift souls

618
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:43,642
into a younger and more beautiful body.

619
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:44,725
Jin Ho-gyeong!

620
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:48,855
Were you not the one who brought
the ice stone out into the world?

621
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:53,276
You are the leader of Jinyowon,
the protector of its relics.

622
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,694
Yet you let the ice stone

623
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:58,156
leave the four walls of Jinyowon so
it could be used for the alchemy of souls.

624
00:51:59,741 --> 00:52:03,662
And the very person who performed
the alchemy of souls

625
00:52:05,121 --> 00:52:06,915
was a mage of Songrim.

626
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:09,459
Park Jin!

627
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:12,254
You hid the truth,
despite knowing everything.

628
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:17,175
You acted like you were eager
to catch everyone who performed sorcery.

629
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:22,138
However, you were busy
trying to hide that man's faults.

630
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:33,316
As for you, Jin Mu.

631
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:38,530
Why are you just standing there
doing nothing?

632
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:44,703
Am I really the only one that is evil
based on the logic and justification

633
00:52:46,162 --> 00:52:47,998
created by these people?

634
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:01,362
Logic and justification are
created by those with power.

635
00:53:01,386 --> 00:53:06,266
But you have lost your power now,
so that makes you evil.

636
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:12,063
Jin Mu, you do not fail to disappoint.

637
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:16,985
Your loyalty is as fickle as the wind.

638
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:19,112
Hand over the rest of the Soul Ejectors.

639
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:21,406
We will return the Queen's body,

640
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:23,575
and you will be set free
without petrification.

641
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:29,039
I advise you to do as I say
if you want your brother to live.

642
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:31,625
My sister.

643
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:34,419
Use the remaining Soul Ejector
to run away.

644
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:39,299
This is the only thing left
that I can do for you.

645
00:53:41,843 --> 00:53:42,928
For that, I am sorry.

646
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:47,766
Father!

647
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:48,975
Father!

648
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:51,518
Father!

649
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:00,528
Father…

650
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:14,209
Father…

651
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:38,483
I will do as you wish
and get rid of the evil ice stone!

652
00:54:38,566 --> 00:54:39,776
However,

653
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:42,445
once the ice stone is gone,

654
00:54:43,279 --> 00:54:48,243
everyone inside it will also die.

655
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:24,798
- Look.
- What is that?

656
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:24,731
Jang Gang?

657
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:26,233
"Jang Gang"?

658
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:29,696
Jang Gang, the Gwanju of Cheonbugwan?

659
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,949
Jang Gang, is that really you?

660
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:35,368
What are you doing here?

661
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:01,102
He is a soul shifter.

662
00:58:11,362 --> 00:58:13,490
The energy of the Soul Ejector is gone.

663
00:58:14,365 --> 00:58:17,202
Someone stopped it.

664
00:58:20,955 --> 00:58:22,415
Gwanju Jang Gang is here.

665
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:40,642
Jang Gang…

666
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:44,729
Did you block the energy
of the Soul Ejector…

667
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:47,607
with your body?

668
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:57,617
Do not go near him.

669
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:59,994
Jang Gang is a soul shifter
and has run wild.

670
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:01,955
Look.

671
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:04,916
His entire body is becoming petrified.

672
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:08,544
He is right.

673
00:59:09,754 --> 00:59:12,882
I performed the forbidden alchemy of souls
and became a soul shifter,

674
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:14,801
and now I am running wild.

675
00:59:16,302 --> 00:59:18,012
You are the Gwanju of Cheonbugwan.

676
00:59:18,096 --> 00:59:20,056
Are you confessing your use of sorcery?

677
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:22,976
Master Lee Cheol,
a pupil of Master Seo Gyeong,

678
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:27,897
has ordered me to confess my sins
in front of the Unanimous Assembly,

679
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:30,817
and that is why I am here.

680
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:38,116
If you have any energy left
to read this letter,

681
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:41,160
use the energy you have
to help those who are enduring

682
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:42,912
the mess you have created.

683
00:59:44,372 --> 00:59:47,166
It will be a chance for you
to end what you have started.

684
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:50,837
Then the star will rise,

685
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,964
and the rock will descend.

686
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:59,220
I am responsible

687
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:03,391
for all the mistakes related to Songrim,
Jinyowon, and Cheonbugwan.

688
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:06,936
I took the ice stone from Jinyowon

689
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:10,023
and used it to perform sorcery.

690
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:14,152
It was also me
who tried to keep it a secret.

691
01:00:15,653 --> 01:00:18,573
I will get petrified here
to make up for all my wrongdoings.

692
01:00:21,075 --> 01:00:23,953
Gwanju Jang Gang was the man
who started all this,

693
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:26,581
so I will allow him to put an end to this

694
01:00:27,665 --> 01:00:28,958
with his death.

695
01:00:36,841 --> 01:00:39,636
I want all of you to witness
the tragic collapse of the man

696
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:42,013
who performed sorcery.

697
01:00:42,096 --> 01:00:44,098
He may be a soul shifter,

698
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:45,892
but you cannot let him die like this.

699
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:48,478
His son, Jang Uk, is inside Jeongjingak.

700
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:51,648
You should wait
until Uk gets out of there.

701
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:55,109
He deserves to say goodbye to his father.

702
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:56,903
He is not my son!

703
01:00:57,528 --> 01:00:59,572
You all know that
I blocked his gate of energy

704
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:01,908
to prevent him
from walking in my footsteps.

705
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:07,455
He already had a miserable childhood.

706
01:01:08,706 --> 01:01:11,000
Do not let him live
as the son of a sinner.

707
01:02:18,776 --> 01:02:20,236
Where am I?

708
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:28,703
What is going on? Am I dead?

709
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:42,592
So it happened.

710
01:02:43,676 --> 01:02:45,428
My energy to cast spells is gone.

711
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:07,492
Is this the ice stone?

712
01:03:08,701 --> 01:03:12,747
Did I finally get it now that I no longer
have the power to do anything with it?

713
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:15,583
Now, this is just

714
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:18,544
nothing more than a stone to me.

715
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:44,904
It is the King's Star!

716
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:47,532
The King's Star is up in the night sky!

717
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:26,904
The King's Star has appeared.
The barrier around Jeongjingak is gone.

718
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:43,462
The ice stone has vanished,

719
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:46,591
and the King's Star has appeared.

720
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:50,136
The King's Star also appeared
when Master Seo Gyeong

721
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:52,597
ended the Great Chaos 200 years ago.

722
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:56,601
Then are you saying that
someone inside Jeongjingak

723
01:04:56,684 --> 01:04:59,729
was born with the same fate
as Master Seo Gyeong?

724
01:05:19,832 --> 01:05:21,667
He is the King's Star.

725
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:23,669
He is the King's Star!

726
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:40,436
The Crown Prince is

727
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:44,106
the newly risen King's Star!

728
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:46,400
- Your Royal Highness!
- Your Royal Highness!

729
01:06:00,998 --> 01:06:03,918
Uk was the one who was born
with the energy of the King's Star.

730
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:08,005
Did he get rid of the ice stone?

731
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:38,285
My pupil, you have lost all your energy.

732
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:44,125
Master, you also have returned
to being just Mu-deok.

733
01:06:46,752 --> 01:06:48,295
I do not mind

734
01:06:49,296 --> 01:06:50,881
since we are together.

735
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:30,004
I heard the wedding is
going to be held at Songrim.

736
01:07:30,087 --> 01:07:32,840
Of course. The groom is a mage of Songrim.

737
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:35,134
I do not approve of this marriage.

738
01:07:35,217 --> 01:07:37,636
I simply cannot believe
that they are getting married.

739
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:39,680
I saw them together a few times.

740
01:07:39,764 --> 01:07:41,432
They make a nice couple.

741
01:07:41,515 --> 01:07:44,310
What is wrong with you?
The groom could do better.

742
01:07:44,393 --> 01:07:45,770
What are you talking about?

743
01:07:45,853 --> 01:07:47,772
That should be said about the bride.

744
01:07:47,855 --> 01:07:49,565
People could not stop talking

745
01:07:49,648 --> 01:07:51,984
about the Unanimous Assembly
and the King's Star.

746
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:54,904
But now they are busy
talking about the upcoming wedding.

747
01:07:56,530 --> 01:07:59,784
The leader of Songrim pushed for
this wedding knowing this would happen.

748
01:07:59,867 --> 01:08:03,245
I must say, I still cannot believe
that those two are getting married.

749
01:08:05,915 --> 01:08:09,293
Young Master Seo, I heard you did not eat.

750
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:11,879
I will eat when I am hungry. Do not worry.

751
01:08:11,962 --> 01:08:13,672
Shall I make you some noodles?

752
01:08:14,298 --> 01:08:15,925
You need to eat to take medicine.

753
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:21,055
I do not need to take it anymore.
Stop bothering me about it.

754
01:08:21,639 --> 01:08:23,516
You are returning to Seoho Fortress soon.

755
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:25,559
You should eat well before you leave…

756
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:33,442
My wound has healed,

757
01:08:34,443 --> 01:08:35,820
and I have regained my energy.

758
01:08:37,363 --> 01:08:39,573
I heard you still
moan in pain in your sleep.

759
01:08:40,491 --> 01:08:41,909
I know you are lying.

760
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:45,996
It does not hurt much.

761
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:55,297
You are such a terrible liar,
Young Master Seo.

762
01:08:57,091 --> 01:09:00,136
You are very pure at heart,
so whenever you are being untrue,

763
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:02,721
it is easy to notice.

764
01:09:04,682 --> 01:09:06,433
It just shows on your face.

765
01:09:08,602 --> 01:09:11,522
It must have been hard for you
to hide it all along.

766
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:20,322
I am sorry.

767
01:09:22,449 --> 01:09:23,909
And thank you…

768
01:09:25,786 --> 01:09:26,996
for protecting me.

769
01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:37,047
And Yul has also been
protecting you all along.

770
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:42,720
Yul knows who you are.

771
01:09:44,096 --> 01:09:45,598
He knows you are a soul shifter

772
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:47,558
and that you are Naksu the assassin.

773
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:50,227
But he tried his best not to show it.

774
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:59,361
He wanted to protect the girl
he had met in Danhyanggok.

775
01:10:07,828 --> 01:10:09,288
You told me that

776
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:12,499
this belonged to the friend
who saved you in Danhyanggok, right?

777
01:10:14,001 --> 01:10:15,127
Yes.

778
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:19,506
I wanted to take her with me

779
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:21,675
to Seoho Fortress.

780
01:10:27,431 --> 01:10:30,976
She had a secret
that she was hiding from everyone,

781
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:35,356
so I wanted to take her there
and help her hide.

782
01:10:40,152 --> 01:10:41,820
I promised that

783
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:45,574
I would help you take her with you.

784
01:10:47,618 --> 01:10:51,497
But that person only exists
in your memory now.

785
01:10:52,456 --> 01:10:54,333
She no longer exists in this world.

786
01:11:03,550 --> 01:11:05,052
At first, I thought

787
01:11:05,135 --> 01:11:08,389
burning this might be the way to help you
erase her from your memory.

788
01:11:09,848 --> 01:11:12,476
But you told me
you loved everything about Danhyanggok.

789
01:11:18,232 --> 01:11:19,566
Take this with you.

790
01:11:32,955 --> 01:11:35,082
I would like to check
if you are healing well,

791
01:11:36,041 --> 01:11:38,294
so allow me
to feel your breathing three times.

792
01:11:59,106 --> 01:12:01,066
Let us say goodbye to each other

793
01:12:03,902 --> 01:12:06,697
while these three breaths last.

794
01:12:19,209 --> 01:12:21,587
I also enjoyed my time with you…

795
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:25,507
at Danhyanggok.

796
01:12:32,639 --> 01:12:33,974
Thank you for everything.

797
01:13:14,848 --> 01:13:17,434
It looks like your wound is healing well.

798
01:13:18,811 --> 01:13:23,273
I know the medicine is bitter,
but make sure you take it regularly.

799
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:31,407
I will.

800
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:35,285
I will take it
no matter how bitter it may be.

801
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:41,792
This time, it will fully heal.

802
01:14:21,165 --> 01:14:24,501
Your father took full responsibility
for everything that happened

803
01:14:24,585 --> 01:14:29,923
by sacrificing his life in the end.

804
01:14:30,799 --> 01:14:33,969
Thanks to him, Songrim and Jinyowon
were not penalized.

805
01:14:41,852 --> 01:14:44,396
He probably denied that you were his son

806
01:14:45,105 --> 01:14:49,526
because he did not want you
to be blamed for his wrongdoings.

807
01:14:53,197 --> 01:14:54,531
Do not worry.

808
01:14:55,032 --> 01:14:59,161
I stopped being bothered by the fact
that I might not be his son.

809
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:06,793
Do you recognize your father?

810
01:15:07,669 --> 01:15:09,796
You have never met him before, have you?

811
01:15:12,424 --> 01:15:13,800
I have met him.

812
01:15:15,219 --> 01:15:16,637
He probably knew

813
01:15:17,930 --> 01:15:19,389
who I was when we met.

814
01:15:20,474 --> 01:15:21,767
It looks as though

815
01:15:22,476 --> 01:15:24,144
you know who I am.

816
01:15:24,811 --> 01:15:27,147
You carry the sword
of Cheonbugwan's Gwanju,

817
01:15:27,231 --> 01:15:28,732
so you must be his son.

818
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:04,017
This is the sword and robe that
the royal family had given to Jang Gang,

819
01:16:04,101 --> 01:16:07,396
the former Gwanju of Cheonbugwan
who died while performing sorcery.

820
01:16:07,479 --> 01:16:12,192
We would like for you to tell us
what to do with his belongings.

821
01:16:12,776 --> 01:16:14,236
Songrim can keep them.

822
01:16:15,654 --> 01:16:17,739
Have you found Jin Mu,
the Assistant Gwanju?

823
01:16:18,490 --> 01:16:19,650
We are still looking for him.

824
01:16:20,617 --> 01:16:23,412
We are sure that
he has not left the capital.

825
01:16:23,495 --> 01:16:25,215
He could have left
in another person's body.

826
01:16:26,456 --> 01:16:28,875
If he does what he did to me
and shifts his soul,

827
01:16:28,959 --> 01:16:30,544
how will Songrim recognize him?

828
01:16:31,670 --> 01:16:33,880
After all,
you were fooled all these years.

829
01:16:37,801 --> 01:16:39,136
Your Highness.

830
01:16:39,219 --> 01:16:42,931
Master Kang of Daegangtongun
ran wild and became petrified,

831
01:16:43,015 --> 01:16:45,100
but Sejukwon succeeded in saving him.

832
01:16:45,726 --> 01:16:49,271
If you ever run wild and get petrified,

833
01:16:49,354 --> 01:16:51,189
there is a way to treat it.

834
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:53,734
What is the point?

835
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:58,947
I will have to live in this horrible body
until the day I die.

836
01:17:01,074 --> 01:17:03,827
How could you let Jang Uk live
when his father was the one

837
01:17:03,910 --> 01:17:06,038
who caused me to become like this?

838
01:17:06,121 --> 01:17:07,414
Jang Gang

839
01:17:07,998 --> 01:17:10,500
took full responsibility
by giving up his life.

840
01:17:11,418 --> 01:17:13,378
We also took away

841
01:17:14,254 --> 01:17:17,841
Jang Uk's rights to become
the next Gwanju of Cheonbugwan.

842
01:17:19,051 --> 01:17:20,844
He washed away his sins

843
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:24,097
by losing everything he had.

844
01:17:25,932 --> 01:17:29,478
When Jang Gang died,
he told us that Jang Uk was not his son.

845
01:17:29,561 --> 01:17:31,605
So it would be unfair
to hold him responsible.

846
01:17:31,688 --> 01:17:35,359
Jang Gang died without telling us
who Jang Uk's father was in the end.

847
01:17:43,533 --> 01:17:45,160
Master Jang Gang wanted me

848
01:17:46,119 --> 01:17:48,413
to give this to you.

849
01:17:53,251 --> 01:17:55,837
He told me that this will show you

850
01:17:56,838 --> 01:17:59,049
who Young Master Jang's father is.

851
01:18:22,322 --> 01:18:23,490
I guess

852
01:18:24,741 --> 01:18:27,786
you also know the truth now,
Maidservant Kim.

853
01:18:29,413 --> 01:18:30,872
I cannot believe it.

854
01:18:31,915 --> 01:18:35,711
Madam Do-hwa gave birth
to the son of the late king?

855
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:39,548
Uk was conceived
when the late king shifted souls

856
01:18:40,674 --> 01:18:43,385
and slept with Do-hwa.

857
01:18:44,094 --> 01:18:48,432
Jang Gang performed the alchemy of souls
and shifted souls

858
01:18:50,475 --> 01:18:52,102
with the late king.

859
01:18:54,187 --> 01:18:59,025
Master Jang ruined his son's life.

860
01:19:00,861 --> 01:19:02,487
If Young Master Jang finds out…

861
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:05,574
I do not plan to tell him.

862
01:19:07,075 --> 01:19:10,704
Not only will I keep it from Uk,

863
01:19:11,872 --> 01:19:13,832
but I will also keep it from everyone.

864
01:19:17,836 --> 01:19:21,173
The King's Star that appeared
the night you destroyed the ice stone

865
01:19:21,256 --> 01:19:23,633
was engraved in a constellation plate.

866
01:19:23,717 --> 01:19:27,387
Everyone is excited to welcome a king
born with the energy of the King's Star.

867
01:19:27,471 --> 01:19:29,139
Would you like to see the plate?

868
01:19:31,057 --> 01:19:32,225
No.

869
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:45,989
Did the Assistant Gwaju

870
01:19:47,032 --> 01:19:49,409
really shift souls and disappear?

871
01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:22,400
Were you hiding inside Cheonbugwan
all this time?

872
01:20:22,901 --> 01:20:26,112
I have been waiting for a chance
to meet you, Your Royal Highness.

873
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:31,076
Are you asking me to spare your life?

874
01:20:31,159 --> 01:20:33,787
You are the only person who can save me,

875
01:20:33,870 --> 01:20:37,541
but I am also the only person
who can protect you.

876
01:20:38,291 --> 01:20:41,044
Protect me from what?

877
01:20:41,127 --> 01:20:44,047
I will protect you
from the true owner of the King's Star.

878
01:20:45,090 --> 01:20:48,343
- What are you talking about?
- You already know that

879
01:20:48,426 --> 01:20:50,846
you are not the true owner.

880
01:20:56,726 --> 01:21:00,647
The man who will outshine you
and will be worshipped by everyone.

881
01:21:00,730 --> 01:21:04,568
The man who will make you collapse.

882
01:21:05,151 --> 01:21:06,570
You are next in line to be king,

883
01:21:06,653 --> 01:21:09,614
and Jang Uk, the owner of the King's Star,
should not be allowed

884
01:21:10,407 --> 01:21:11,658
to rise above you.

885
01:21:13,827 --> 01:21:18,498
I promise to get rid of
that ominous light for you.

886
01:21:24,296 --> 01:21:26,548
The one thing
that I desperately yearned for…

887
01:21:29,259 --> 01:21:31,011
actually belonged to Jang Uk.

888
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:02,083
How pretty. You look beautiful.

889
01:22:03,668 --> 01:22:06,379
You look magnificent.

890
01:22:08,548 --> 01:22:10,008
You are about to drool.

891
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:12,719
- You can take it off now.
- Why did you

892
01:22:12,802 --> 01:22:15,555
ask me to put this on anyway?
Why not the bride herself?

893
01:22:15,639 --> 01:22:18,975
Her father is in a very bad state,
so she could not make it.

894
01:22:19,059 --> 01:22:21,436
Your build is similar to hers,
so that is why.

895
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:23,229
You can get changed now.

896
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:27,025
Come on. Let us leave
so she can get changed.

897
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:30,695
- Stop staring. Let us go.
- She is the most beautiful woman ever.

898
01:22:30,779 --> 01:22:32,113
She really is.

899
01:22:35,909 --> 01:22:37,035
I guess…

900
01:22:37,994 --> 01:22:39,621
I look quite nice.

901
01:22:41,456 --> 01:22:42,540
Oh, hey.

902
01:22:42,624 --> 01:22:44,376
Mu-deok is here, right? Where is she?

903
01:22:44,459 --> 01:22:45,710
Mu-deok is…

904
01:22:48,546 --> 01:22:50,340
She is in that room over there.

905
01:22:50,423 --> 01:22:51,883
- Go on inside.
- All right.

906
01:23:02,602 --> 01:23:03,853
Goodness.

907
01:23:04,646 --> 01:23:06,982
I heard there was a bride
about to get married soon.

908
01:23:07,774 --> 01:23:08,774
Is that you?

909
01:23:09,609 --> 01:23:10,610
No.

910
01:23:15,740 --> 01:23:17,617
Look who it is. It is my master.

911
01:23:18,368 --> 01:23:20,495
I told you to wait for me at Sejukwon.

912
01:23:20,578 --> 01:23:23,415
- What are you doing here?
- Heo Yeom sent me to fetch some wine.

913
01:23:23,498 --> 01:23:25,166
Then Ju-wol asked me to put this on.

914
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:28,086
I need to get changed now.
Wait for me outside.

915
01:23:28,169 --> 01:23:29,462
No, wait.

916
01:23:29,546 --> 01:23:32,674
This is actually not a bad place.
After all, it is where we first met.

917
01:23:34,217 --> 01:23:35,885
Not a bad place for what?

918
01:23:37,721 --> 01:23:40,098
There is a very important ritual
that we must do.

919
01:23:41,057 --> 01:23:42,726
First, come sit here.

920
01:23:53,611 --> 01:23:55,071
What is going on?

921
01:23:55,905 --> 01:23:57,115
This is not necessary.

922
01:24:00,744 --> 01:24:04,164
Stop it. You are embarrassing me.
What is with you?

923
01:24:09,335 --> 01:24:11,212
It is only embarrassing at first.

924
01:24:11,296 --> 01:24:13,089
But you get used to it after 13 times.

925
01:24:14,382 --> 01:24:15,467
What?

926
01:24:16,092 --> 01:24:18,178
You've proposed 13 times?

927
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:21,806
Master.

928
01:24:22,515 --> 01:24:26,061
As of today,
I wish to end my training as your pupil.

929
01:24:29,147 --> 01:24:32,150
I am grateful that
you always pushed me to train harder

930
01:24:32,734 --> 01:24:34,986
despite how lacking I was.

931
01:24:37,155 --> 01:24:38,323
I know that

932
01:24:38,406 --> 01:24:40,784
you gave up your chance
to regain your energy.

933
01:24:41,576 --> 01:24:44,829
And I, too, chose to give up
the energy I tried so hard to build.

934
01:24:45,622 --> 01:24:49,667
But instead, I now have someone precious
that I wish to keep by my side forever.

935
01:24:53,463 --> 01:24:57,884
I do not wish to be used and discarded.
I wish to protect and cherish you.

936
01:24:58,551 --> 01:25:01,513
Thus, allow me to quit.

937
01:25:06,893 --> 01:25:08,394
I, Mu-deok, your master,

938
01:25:09,479 --> 01:25:11,606
will allow my pupil, Jang Uk, to quit.

939
01:25:16,361 --> 01:25:17,403
All right, then.

940
01:25:18,613 --> 01:25:21,449
Marry me, Mu-deok.

941
01:25:53,731 --> 01:25:56,484
I have decided to get married
to Young Master Jang.

942
01:25:56,568 --> 01:25:57,837
There has been no woman around you.

943
01:25:57,861 --> 01:25:59,571
This will all be for Mu-deok.

944
01:25:59,654 --> 01:26:00,572
That cannot be!

945
01:26:00,655 --> 01:26:04,450
I will find the sword
that can help you destroy Jang Uk.

946
01:26:04,534 --> 01:26:06,870
Jin Mu must be killed.

947
01:26:06,953 --> 01:26:10,498
Are you saying that they had
all deceived and mocked me?

948
01:26:10,582 --> 01:26:12,876
They are trying to protect Jang Uk.

949
01:26:12,959 --> 01:26:15,003
An assassin has appeared in Sejukwon!

950
01:26:15,086 --> 01:26:17,005
I believe Mu-deok's body
originally belonged

951
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:19,007
to someone with great divine powers.

952
01:26:20,175 --> 01:26:23,887
Naksu. You have given me hope.

953
01:26:25,930 --> 01:26:30,935
