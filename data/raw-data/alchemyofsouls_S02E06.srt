00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:44,958
ALCHEMY OF SOULS PART 2

2
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:49,342
I imagined myself sitting
alone on top of a tall tree.

3
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:51,473
I knew no one

4
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:54,101
and I was powerless and alone.

5
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,182
I had hoped someone
would come to rescue me.

6
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:01,767
And then you came.

7
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:04,688
What…

8
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:07,729
was that about?

9
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,569
That was my story.

10
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:16,275
It was a thought that I had
during my time in that room.

11
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,332
I do not have that
stone with me right now.

12
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:39,348
I must be going crazy…

13
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,518
because of you.

14
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,237
Why do you keep confusing me?

15
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:52,802
What is there to
be confused about?

16
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,660
You hold my hand and
listen to my stories

17
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,450
only to think
about someone else.

18
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:04,419
If you miss her so much, how about
I help you out a little more?

19
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,602
Shall I hold you in my arms
and put you to bed as well?

20
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,086
Shall I just do
everything she did?

21
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,089
A tree like that
actually existed.

22
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,882
A big, tall tree.

23
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,257
There was a tree
that we had promised

24
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:18,846
to climb up together.

25
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,138
Is that tree in Danhyanggok?

26
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:25,769
Is it?

27
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,771
I wonder how I know
about that place.

28
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:30,863
Maybe I went there
when I was little?

29
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:35,267
This is why I have trouble
believing that they are yours.

30
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:39,622
It is your choice whether
to believe me or not.

31
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,155
But this is my hand
that you are holding,

32
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:46,331
and it will be me who holds you
and puts you to bed at night.

33
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:47,916
So…

34
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,924
when you are looking at
me, see me for who I am…

35
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,970
just like you did that night.

36
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:58,511
I am not dreaming.

37
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:00,175
Do you recognize me?

38
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:01,263
Yes.

39
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:03,347
You woke me up.

40
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,021
Someone just entered.

41
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,686
I can see the energy of a human

42
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:15,861
behind that tree.

43
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:22,118
I recognize that energy. I
think it is someone I know.

44
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:24,331
Someone you know? Is it
someone from Jinyowon?

45
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,079
No.

46
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,420
It is your friend.

47
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:38,216
Seo Yul?

48
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:39,843
Jang Uk?

49
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,313
It really is you.

50
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:50,476
She told me she could
see your energy.

51
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:51,813
What are you doing here?

52
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,688
I am here looking for someone.

53
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:58,404
I know how to take out
the blood parasite.

54
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:01,658
If you tell me who knows, I
will let that person live.

55
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:05,163
I knew it.

56
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:09,417
So there is a way to get it out.

57
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,459
Yes. Now tell me who knows.

58
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:13,126
Tell me.

59
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,554
- It is Jin Mu.
- Jin Mu?

60
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:19,633
No.

61
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,180
Park Jin of Songrim.

62
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:27,523
What?

63
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,850
Actually…

64
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,612
it is His Majesty the King.

65
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,491
I was going to grant
you a painless death,

66
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,480
but you brought
this on yourself.

67
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,955
Let us see if you will be
able to keep your mouth shut

68
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,881
even after taking this
excruciating potion.

69
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:05,637
Lady Jin.

70
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,677
Jang Uk wishes to
meet you, my lady.

71
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,767
Right now? Tell him
I have gone to bed.

72
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,443
He knows you are
not in your room.

73
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:16,401
It would be troublesome if he
goes around looking for you.

74
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,472
What brings you
here at this hour?

75
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,076
I came to ask you for a favor.

76
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,962
Please allow me to enter
Jinyowon for a moment.

77
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:37,384
Jinyowon?

78
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:40,132
I thought about asking Bu-yeon
to secretly let me inside,

79
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:42,974
but that did not seem appropriate,
so I came to ask you myself.

80
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,243
So-i, wake up.

81
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,786
Do you recognize me?

82
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:11,828
Seo Yul?

83
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:13,535
Yes.

84
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:16,374
Hold on to me.

85
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,960
She said there is a way.

86
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:26,637
There is a way to save you.

87
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,099
We have no time.

88
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,179
Let us talk outside.

89
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,104
Jin Bu-yeon?

90
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:36,064
Are you all right? Did
my mother do this to you?

91
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:41,606
You must really think
you are Jin Bu-yeon.

92
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:42,992
What do you mean?

93
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,369
She helped me find you.

94
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,365
First, let us get out of here.

95
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,931
This is the fire bird.

96
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,514
I see it has not hatched yet.

97
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:11,314
When this fire bird
hatches out of its egg,

98
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,309
the world will suffer
from severe drought.

99
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,811
And Jinyowon will fall

100
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,273
if this egg gets
taken out of here?

101
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,271
Right.

102
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:22,612
I do not plan to do such
a thing, so do not worry.

103
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:26,742
Master Lee could have just
asked me to show this to him.

104
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:30,575
I wonder why he asked
you to come and check.

105
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:32,118
Because he does not trust you.

106
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,747
You even unveiled
the ice stone once.

107
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,828
It was a choice I made to save
Bu-yeon when I was pregnant with her.

108
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,996
The person who did not
return it after its use

109
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,171
was your father, Jang Gang.

110
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:47,514
And in the end,

111
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:50,762
his son ended up with the
ice stone inside his body.

112
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,718
I guess it will not be
easy for us to get along

113
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:57,017
seeing that you have so
many reasons to hate me.

114
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:59,651
That is why I want to put
an end to this relationship.

115
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,650
My daughter was doing
fine under my protection.

116
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,152
Why did you have
to take her away?

117
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,323
I had no reason to

118
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,920
until I saw the
darkness behind it all.

119
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,530
Hiding her in that dark room

120
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:13,905
and sewing that thread into her back
is not what a loving mother would do.

121
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,184
You really think
she was doing fine?

122
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,206
Perhaps you happen to
enjoy things like that?

123
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,460
Being locked up in a dark room
and getting poked by needles?

124
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:24,714
I was protecting her.

125
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,065
She is the eldest daughter
of the Jin family.

126
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,089
Her duty is to protect Jinyowon

127
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,236
by giving birth to a daughter
and carrying on the family line.

128
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,760
Are you trying to pressure me?

129
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,938
Then you could have at least
served a brood hen for dinner.

130
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,313
But then again, you
showed me this fire bird,

131
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:45,017
so I will count that
as encouragement.

132
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,263
The person Seo Yul was
looking for was severely hurt.

133
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,117
- Who was it?
- A woman.

134
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,036
Her name was So-i.

135
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,670
So-i?

136
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:21,143
I guess you received
the message I sent you,

137
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,647
seeing that you came to save me.

138
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,273
Yes, I did.

139
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,031
It is the truth.

140
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,239
Jin Ho-gyeong's real daughter

141
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,821
was Mu-deok from Sari Village.

142
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:36,276
Does that mean the Jin Bu-yeon
you saw earlier was fake?

143
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:43,081
That was what I initially
thought when I went there,

144
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,252
but it turns out she was real.

145
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,091
- What?
- Jin Ho-gyeong

146
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:53,092
took out Mu-deok's body from Lake
Gyeongcheondaeho and saved her.

147
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,505
But the thing is,

148
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,764
inside that body
still lives the soul

149
00:09:58,472 --> 00:09:59,472
of Naksu.

150
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,313
Naksu?

151
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:04,394
Yes.

152
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,523
Naksu lives inside
Jin Bu-yeon's body.

153
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,649
Also, Jin Bu-yeon's current face

154
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,324
is that of Naksu.

155
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,796
No wonder she seemed
familiar when we first met.

156
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,804
I failed to recognize her
because I never imagined

157
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,629
that I would meet her again.

158
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,759
There you are.

159
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,048
She is alive.

160
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,013
Jin Bu-yeon…

161
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:24,729
was her all along.

162
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:35,444
Are you all right?

163
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,664
You look like you
are about to cry.

164
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:47,914
By any chance,

165
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:49,999
do you feel ill?

166
00:11:58,509 --> 00:11:59,589
What is the matter?

167
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:01,297
Do you feel very ill?

168
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,642
My thoughts have lost their way

169
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,351
due to the confusion I feel.

170
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,019
Let me stay like this

171
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,019
just for a little while.

172
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,766
I cannot leave you
here like this.

173
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:53,855
I think it is best
that I tell Jang Uk.

174
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,322
Do not tell him.

175
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,742
I do not wish for him to know.

176
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,093
We did nothing wrong.

177
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:20,423
Young Master Seo
Yul allowed us in.

178
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:21,508
Yul?

179
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:24,969
He is right.

180
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,600
I brought them here. Let him go.

181
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,320
What happened?

182
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,149
I heard the girl
you saved is So-i.

183
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:42,154
Why would you get
involved with her?

184
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,340
Did she do something to you?

185
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,414
Do not worry.

186
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:46,735
I was indebted to her.

187
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:51,246
I heard she was taken away by Lady Jin,
so I helped her to return the favor.

188
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,210
Why were you indebted to So-i?

189
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,460
She looked after me back
when I was severely injured

190
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,592
inside the barrier.

191
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,630
Young Lady Heo also knows.

192
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,086
I see.

193
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,615
I still cannot believe you climbed
over the walls of Jinyowon.

194
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:10,458
I was able to get out without
getting caught thanks to you.

195
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,640
Gosh.

196
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:17,685
So is there anything
else I can help you with?

197
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,570
There is something I
must handle on my own.

198
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,023
It is my responsibility now.

199
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:36,751
He was quick to subdue us,
so we did not see his face.

200
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,424
But it was definitely a man.

201
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,002
Who could it be?

202
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,547
It is Jin Mu.

203
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,630
No.

204
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:46,046
Park Jin of Songrim.

205
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,430
It is His Majesty the King.

206
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,980
None of them must find out.

207
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,523
I must keep it a secret.

208
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,738
Fortunately, there are
no severe injuries.

209
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,867
Apply ointment on her
wounds, and she will be fine.

210
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,581
Thank you.

211
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,104
Young Master Seo is right.

212
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:33,639
So-i really did take good care
of him back when he was hurt.

213
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,345
I have no reason
not to believe you.

214
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:40,305
She even cut herself to
share her blood with him.

215
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:41,898
She shared her blood?

216
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:43,572
It did not help much,

217
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,781
but that is how much she cared.

218
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:50,235
Will you be staying
at Jeongjingak?

219
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,914
I will also stay here so
I can take care of So-i.

220
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,210
I thought

221
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:06,053
you and Young Master Jang would be
at Jinyowon meeting your mother.

222
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,171
We already went.

223
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,556
We left earlier than
expected to help a friend.

224
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,005
I see.

225
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:15,675
I guess Young Master Jang cared
more about helping his friend.

226
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:18,136
Your presence is of no help,
unlike Young Lady Heo's,

227
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,977
so you should go home.

228
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,272
I will escort you home.

229
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:25,065
I was talking about my friend,
not Young Master Jang's.

230
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,650
Then are you saying Young
Master Seo is your friend?

231
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,607
Yes, I am here for a reason.

232
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,446
I need to talk to
my friend, Seo Yul.

233
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:35,945
So I should get going now.

234
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:40,922
What do you need to
talk about with Yul?

235
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,627
She claims to be
friends with him.

236
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,631
Yes, I would like to
talk to my friend.

237
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,303
So are you not going to go home?

238
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,472
No, I am also
going to stay here.

239
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,556
Goodbye then, Young Master Jang.

240
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,564
Goodbye. I will
be going home now.

241
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:14,947
Just come home with me.

242
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,659
All right. Fine.

243
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:21,998
Let us go.

244
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:43,152
When did you become
friends with Yul?

245
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,524
We are both foolish
in our own ways,

246
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,823
so we agreed to be friends.

247
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:52,281
You may be a fool, but
Yul is far from it.

248
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,620
He gets lost when
he is flustered.

249
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:57,905
He told you that?

250
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:01,119
Well, I found out as
we spent time together.

251
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,995
How much time did
you spend with him?

252
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,582
Quite a lot.

253
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,286
We spent time at Chwiseonru
and Gaema Village.

254
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,510
I remember now.

255
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:13,585
So-i was the girl I
met at Gaema Village.

256
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:14,835
You met her?

257
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,637
She stole something from me,
and Seo Yul helped me that day.

258
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:19,555
Really?

259
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,944
A lot of things happened
that I do not know about.

260
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:27,022
You and Yul must
be pretty close.

261
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,820
I thought he was the man
I was supposed to marry

262
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,861
when I first met
him at Chwiseonru.

263
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:37,276
If I met him a lot earlier, I may
not have thought about running away.

264
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,366
I see.

265
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,910
It must be a pity. It would have
been nice if he were your husband.

266
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,210
He is handsome and kind.

267
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,663
He would not have talked about going
crazy after holding my hand like you did.

268
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:53,012
Do you feel all right now?

269
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,638
You told me to see
you for who you were.

270
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,191
That is what I am trying to do.

271
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,030
Jang Uk,

272
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,655
try summoning fireflies.

273
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,496
That is not an easy
thing to do, you know.

274
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:27,369
Then try setting
off some fireworks.

275
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,288
Hey, do you know
how much that costs?

276
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:33,507
Besides, where am I supposed
to find fireworks right now?

277
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:36,837
Do not tell anyone that
Jin Bu-yeon is Naksu.

278
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,295
Of course.

279
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:41,635
It needs to be kept a secret for
Jin Ho-gyeong to save your life.

280
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:44,062
Jang Uk cannot find out either.

281
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:46,976
I know.

282
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:50,145
He has gone through enough.

283
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,069
- It is my responsibility now.
- Your responsibility?

284
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,895
What responsibility
do you have for Naksu?

285
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,487
I also knew.

286
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,657
You also knew back then

287
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,998
that Mu-deok was Naksu?

288
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,878
You knew, yet you
kept it a secret? Why?

289
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:13,089
Your wound is not severe,
so you will recover soon.

290
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,106
I will find you a
safe place to stay.

291
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,380
Leave as soon as you are ready.

292
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,725
Young Master Seo,
are you all right?

293
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:29,662
Does it hurt?

294
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,252
It was just another nightmare.

295
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,921
Is it her who constantly appears

296
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,253
in your dreams?

297
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:48,064
I also possess an item that is dear
to me, so I know what it means.

298
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:50,852
The fact that you
still have that

299
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,442
means you still care.

300
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,691
Then I guess I
should throw it away.

301
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,971
If what you said is true, it
means all my pain and regrets…

302
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,542
derive from this.

303
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,333
By any chance,

304
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:17,843
are you planning to kill Naksu?

305
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,260
Then you cannot receive
Jinyowon's help, and you will die.

306
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,880
I know.

307
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,926
How could I expect to live…

308
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,637
if I plan to get rid of her?

309
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:30,723
Exactly.

310
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:33,444
Do not kill her if you
wish to live. And besides…

311
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:37,112
you like her.

312
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:46,864
Get some rest.

313
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:03,801
Young Master.

314
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:07,968
I…

315
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,011
Am now betrothed

316
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,810
to Lord Park Jin of Songrim.

317
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:21,396
Why are you so quiet?

318
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:24,646
Are you upset that I
am getting married?

319
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:27,362
- Should I not get married?
- No, I just…

320
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,867
I do not know what
to call you now.

321
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:32,868
Goodness.

322
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:36,077
Just call me Maidservant Kim.

323
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:38,294
Even if I marry Lord Park,

324
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:42,669
you will always be
my young master.

325
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,304
No, that is not it.

326
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,929
I am most grateful to you, and
I care for you more than anyone.

327
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:52,931
I want to be able to say more

328
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:55,734
than just congratulate you.

329
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:01,606
Who cares what you call me?

330
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,860
I may treat you like
my young master,

331
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:08,028
but you are

332
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:10,663
like a son to me.

333
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:17,663
I know.

334
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,289
I feel the same way.

335
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:25,254
Maidservant Kim.

336
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,512
Congratulations.

337
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,143
Young Master.

338
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:50,605
The reason we visited
you last night

339
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:52,317
was to urgently
show these to you.

340
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,948
Again, congratulations
on your engagement.

341
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:58,286
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

342
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:00,041
Thank you, everyone.

343
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:04,092
I will be welcoming
an aunt at last.

344
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,879
Will I also be getting
a niece or nephew?

345
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:11,758
Know when to stop.

346
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:13,966
Why is he giving up so quickly?

347
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:17,524
You found several of these in
dried-up wells around Daeho Fortress?

348
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:20,849
Yes, these boatmen here also
found some in the canal.

349
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:23,976
Someone is deliberately trying
to dry up all the water.

350
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:27,284
I will find out where
they were created.

351
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:30,529
They contain the energy of a volcano, so
that is probably where they were made.

352
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:33,992
Thoroughly examine all the items that
come in from the southern volcano.

353
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,200
Yes, my lord.

354
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:44,168
Songrim will be inspecting
the goods on all the boats?

355
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,381
Yes.

356
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,050
I can no longer let your
boat pass as an exception.

357
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:58,007
The boat from the volcano should arrive
at Daeho Fortress any moment now.

358
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,907
Send a homing bird and tell them
to discard everything on the boat.

359
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:03,978
Yes, my lord.

360
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:25,331
He wants us to get
rid of everything?

361
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:28,457
Is it safe to discard something so
ghastly in Lake Gyeongcheondaeho?

362
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:31,755
What is with you? We just
need to do as we are told.

363
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,010
Just get on with it.

364
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,721
My goodness.

365
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,220
I checked the fire
bird within Jinyowon.

366
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:44,848
It was a lot smaller than expected,
but it was safe and sound.

367
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:45,936
Is that so?

368
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:48,034
I thought you did not
want to get involved.

369
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,440
I had to go anyway, so I just
checked while I was there.

370
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:54,316
You never do anything
you do not wish to do,

371
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:55,704
so that is hard to believe.

372
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,703
I really do not wish
to get involved,

373
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:00,954
but let me tell
you what I heard.

374
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:04,456
There are people who are after
the fire bird in Jinyowon.

375
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:06,365
The long-lasting drought

376
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:09,219
has dried up the wells and canals
and is causing dissent among people.

377
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:11,647
Please allow Cheonbugwan to
gather the Unanimous Assembly

378
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:14,471
and advance the date
for the lake's rite.

379
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:17,389
It is strange that all the wells
and canals have been drying up

380
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:19,394
just because of the drought.

381
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:22,471
Fortunately, the fear of soul
shifters has died down in the capital

382
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:25,597
after Jang Uk managed
to get rid of Naksu.

383
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:29,648
The Crown Prince shall visit
Jang Uk and reward him as always.

384
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:31,271
Your Majesty.

385
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:33,818
This time, he deserves
a bigger reward.

386
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:39,323
Appoint him as the general of the
North Fortress and send him there.

387
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,700
Are you asking me

388
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:44,372
to make him leave
Daeho Fortress?

389
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:47,794
Without him, the capital
could become unstable again.

390
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:50,924
Right now, Cheonbugwan
has more mages

391
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,842
than Jeongjingak has ever had.

392
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,521
With our mages' protection and the
leadership of the Crown Prince,

393
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,550
who was born with the
energy of the King's Star,

394
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,594
no one in the capital
will feel unsettled.

395
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:12,645
When the world suffered from
severe drought 200 years ago,

396
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:14,532
the ice stone fell from the sky.

397
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:16,239
It looks like these people

398
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:18,609
are trying to do the same
by waking the fire bird.

399
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:22,156
The royal family and Cheonbugwan
are the ones behind it.

400
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:26,286
Do you wish for me to
fight against them?

401
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,831
A fight like that would
be considered a revolt.

402
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:33,882
If you win the fight,

403
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:37,344
you could even become the King.

404
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,137
What?

405
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:44,348
You already know that the King's Star,
which is known to be the Crown Prince's,

406
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,933
is actually yours.

407
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:53,357
That also means you know
who your real father is.

408
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:57,318
How long do you plan to
keep me locked up in here?

409
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:58,992
Just because I wish

410
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:01,279
to keep you locked up

411
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:03,525
does not mean I can.

412
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,656
You possess the power
of the ice stone.

413
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,658
I know you are holding
back for my sake.

414
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:09,907
Jin Mu

415
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:13,252
and the royal family
were behind it all.

416
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:16,214
- I need to know what they did to her.
- And do what?

417
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:19,916
Will you kill them all?

418
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:22,236
Like you said, it is not impossible
with the power I possess.

419
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,640
Fighting against the royal family
and Cheonbugwan is a revolt.

420
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:28,352
Are you going to use the energy
of the sky to disrupt the world?

421
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:29,483
I do not care!

422
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:34,148
I do not care for this world.

423
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,480
The one person I wanted
to protect is dead.

424
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:38,567
And in the most…

425
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:41,913
brutal way possible.

426
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,212
Here.

427
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:58,455
You have always wondered if
Jang Gang was your real father.

428
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:02,512
This is the gold plaque and letter
that your real father left for you.

429
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,773
Jang Gang briefly switched
bodies with your father

430
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:10,228
using the alchemy of souls.

431
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:14,940
Your father's soul pursued your
mother, and she gave birth to a baby,

432
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:17,147
which was you.

433
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,938
You are the son
of the late King.

434
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:25,907
You were born through
the alchemy of souls.

435
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:28,833
If not for that, you
would not have been born.

436
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,825
You were not meant to exist.

437
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:32,913
Are you saying

438
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,169
my birth is a sin in itself?

439
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,501
On the night of your birth,

440
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:40,368
the King's Star was in the sky.

441
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:43,881
And to conceal that,

442
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:46,217
Naksu's father, Cho Chung, died.

443
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:51,063
Jang Gang also died to take responsibility
and to keep everything a secret.

444
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,350
And the one person
you wanted to protect

445
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:58,114
was likely used and killed
by those who wanted you dead.

446
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:11,949
If you intend to use your power

447
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:16,165
gained by being born under the King's
Star merely to bring chaos to the world,

448
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:17,499
then I, too…

449
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,005
shall do anything to stop you,

450
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,220
even if I die by your hands.

451
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,569
I am guilty of existing

452
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,318
when I should not.

453
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:49,277
So I have decided to do nothing.

454
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:50,365
Jang Uk.

455
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,200
"It is better to die
than to do nothing."

456
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:57,458
That is what your master
always used to tell you.

457
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:00,706
My master, Seo Gyeong,

458
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:03,173
was also born with the
energy of the King's Star,

459
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,514
but he did not become King.

460
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,799
Instead, he protected the world.

461
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:09,433
How can I protect the world
when I could not even protect

462
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:12,237
the one person I had
sworn to keep safe?

463
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:16,556
I guess you are not thrilled to
possess the power of the ice stone

464
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:20,095
since you gained it by getting
killed by that one person.

465
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:21,858
Why did Master Seo Gyeong

466
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,444
leave behind the ice stone?

467
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:27,445
He wrote in Words of the Heart
that he left it to save his lover,

468
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:28,698
Jin Seol-ran.

469
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,160
But eventually, she died.

470
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:33,369
Why did he keep the ice
stone inside Jinyowon?

471
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:35,931
Maybe it was for you. You were
also born under the King's Star.

472
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:39,748
I will be off.

473
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:01,937
We found them.

474
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:06,942
They really are here.

475
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,154
You are incredible.

476
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:16,200
I can see why people say you
remind them of Jin Seol-ran.

477
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:19,106
It is amazing that you are able
to see that kind of energy.

478
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:22,749
Seeing energy is
all I can do yet.

479
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,394
You said your divine powers will
return along with your memories.

480
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,052
Then tell me.

481
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,770
Have you regained a
lot of your memories?

482
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:32,216
I have seen several
past memories,

483
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:34,259
but they are not mine.

484
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:39,227
I am able to see other people's
memories by touching their items.

485
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:43,189
I guess my divine powers are
slowly starting to come back.

486
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:44,811
I see.

487
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:46,227
I am glad to hear that.

488
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,820
If that earthenware
is dangerous,

489
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:52,323
I can keep looking for them.

490
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:54,602
Would you kindly do that for me?

491
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:56,494
Whoever keeps you by their side

492
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:59,496
will be able to avoid
dangerous objects.

493
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:02,621
Some people possess energy
that should be avoided.

494
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:05,496
Have you ever come
across such a person?

495
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:08,714
The energy inside people
is not always constant,

496
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:12,796
but those in a frenzy carry an energy
that suffocates me when seen up close.

497
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,983
People say you resemble spring

498
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,389
as it is the most beautiful
season among the four.

499
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:26,186
I really do see

500
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,150
a beautiful liveliness in you.

501
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:31,741
Thank you.

502
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,740
A spiritless person like me

503
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:41,406
is desperate for the
vitality of spring.

504
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,799
I am quite fond of you.
Come and visit me often.

505
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,394
I would like to get a glimpse

506
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,600
of the spring that
is soon to come.

507
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:04,686
Yes, Your Highness.

508
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:15,362
Your Royal Highness, why do you suddenly
wish to hunt somewhere far away?

509
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,116
It is suffocating
inside the palace.

510
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:20,164
I wish to depart
now, so pack lightly.

511
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,289
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

512
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:35,968
Let me know when
you see the energy.

513
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,180
We will stop the boat.

514
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,260
I will.

515
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,225
Wait.

516
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,150
Stop the boat.

517
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:59,949
I remember dangling
from here once.

518
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:01,279
When?

519
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:02,367
Why?

520
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:04,953
I have no strength.

521
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:13,748
What is the matter?

522
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,418
Why did you suddenly
dangle from there?

523
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:17,757
I once dangled from there

524
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,643
only to realize that
I had no strength.

525
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,387
Well…

526
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,983
it seems like you are exhausted.

527
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:30,772
You should get some rest nearby.

528
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,198
This is my memory.

529
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:40,985
I even remember my arms hurting.

530
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:50,998
I forgot to bring
home the turtle.

531
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:52,883
I almost left it here all alone.

532
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,960
I told the owner to
take good care of it.

533
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,966
Still, I bet it is waiting
for its owner to come.

534
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:06,814
Go out and get some fresh air.

535
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,021
Pardon?

536
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,100
Go and take a walk.

537
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:10,977
Right.

538
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:12,437
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

539
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:23,744
"I have no strength"?

540
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:26,744
Does that mean I
had strength before?

541
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,463
It does not like that.

542
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:31,459
Eunuch.

543
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,580
You are here.

544
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:35,499
That turtle only eats
meat wrapped in lettuce.

545
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:37,166
- Really?
- Are you dumb or what?

546
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,855
It is refusing because it is you.
It never refuses when I feed it.

547
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:41,883
Watch.

548
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,640
Turtle.

549
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,300
Here is a piece of lettuce.

550
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:46,388
Eat up.

551
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:51,643
You see that?

552
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:54,187
It only cares for me.
What a clever turtle.

553
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,612
Did you see how fast it moved?

554
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,030
I bet it is the fastest
turtle in Daeho.

555
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:00,244
That is one lucky turtle

556
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:01,739
seeing how loved it is.

557
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:04,656
What is wrong?

558
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:08,199
Has your husband still not come
home because of that peacock?

559
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,076
He does come home these days,

560
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:12,248
but I still sleep alone.

561
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:14,381
Why not do anything?
You are a shaman.

562
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:17,338
Curse the peacock and make
her leave your husband.

563
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,840
Or feed your husband a potion
that will captivate him.

564
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:22,426
You are too young
to be so woeful.

565
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:25,338
How would a eunuch like you
know anything about marriage?

566
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:27,925
Or anything about
sleeping alone?

567
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:31,346
I may not know any of that,
but I do know your situation.

568
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,346
If he left home, you could at
least hope for him to return.

569
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:36,107
But sleeping separately?

570
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:37,108
That means it is over.

571
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:39,229
If he never bothers
to visit your room,

572
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,377
you might as well move out.

573
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:41,741
You are right.

574
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:45,158
I am done staying in
that room all alone.

575
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:47,029
There you go. You
should cheat too.

576
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:49,326
Stop giving me
unwholesome solutions.

577
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:54,173
I will find a room of my own.

578
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:56,899
You do not even
have your own room?

579
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:01,304
I feel anxious because the room I
stay in does not feel like it is mine.

580
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:04,008
It only ends up confusing him,

581
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:06,512
which is why he cannot find me.

582
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,310
I shall find a room of my own.

583
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,557
Thank you for your
advice. It really helped.

584
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:16,854
It did?

585
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,418
If you fail to find your own
room, you can come live with me.

586
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:22,572
My house has many rooms.

587
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:26,317
Where were you going?

588
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:30,872
My house has many rooms, but none
of them make me feel at home.

589
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:34,624
You could say I am running
away to avoid something.

590
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:37,165
You possess a very noble energy,

591
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:40,249
but I guess you also have
a peacock that bothers you.

592
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,045
Yes, I do.

593
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:45,803
There is this guy I hate
who is too good to be true.

594
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:49,029
Have you heard of the crow that
placed peacock feathers among its own

595
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,303
so it could act like a peacock?

596
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:52,812
I am that crow.

597
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:56,807
If you feel uneasy about
pretending, then why not stop?

598
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,859
I have already come too far.

599
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:01,941
I am hopeless now.

600
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:04,817
You saved this turtle.

601
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,120
A man like you can
never be hopeless.

602
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:14,958
You are a bad judge of character, but
you do know how to comfort people.

603
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:23,587
Thank you for motivating
me with improper words.

604
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:26,086
I need to go and finish
what I was doing.

605
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:27,383
Have a safe trip.

606
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:37,310
Instead of going hunting,
maybe I should visit Jang Uk

607
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:40,187
since he even took care of you.

608
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,486
I informed him of your visit.

609
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:54,055
How dare he not show
up to greet you.

610
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:56,497
I will go and bring Jang Uk.

611
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:12,394
THE FIRE BIRD'S EGG

612
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:17,269
THE FIRE BIRD

613
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:21,154
The fire bird.

614
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:25,189
It looks like Jang Uk
already knows about this.

615
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:36,201
Are you here to reward me?

616
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:38,123
You can leave it and go.

617
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:39,254
His Majesty the King

618
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:42,834
wishes to give you a
bigger reward this time.

619
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:44,728
He will send you
to North Fortress

620
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:46,712
after appointing
you as a general.

621
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,045
North Fortress?

622
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,337
- That is far.
- What will you do?

623
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:53,433
Will you go?

624
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:57,351
Will you feel at ease if I
leave somewhere far away?

625
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:00,338
Do not go if you do not wish to.

626
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,845
It is true that you bother me,

627
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:05,519
but to Jin Mu, you
will be a big obstacle.

628
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:08,646
I guess you finally feel uneasy
about holding hands with Jin Mu.

629
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:10,738
But unfortunately,

630
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:15,164
I do not wish to become his
obstacle for your own good.

631
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:22,915
You must think I am trying to
use you to keep Jin Mu in check.

632
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:24,539
I understand.

633
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:27,335
You will probably think that
way no matter what I say.

634
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:29,839
Why are you suddenly
telling me these things?

635
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,422
The turtle.

636
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:33,337
- Why were you kind to my turtle?
- Turtle?

637
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:35,835
If you hate me so much, why
were you nice to my turtle?

638
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:38,428
That turtle was yours? I
thought it was Eunuch Oh's.

639
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:43,643
I see.

640
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:45,852
I was foolishly mistaken.

641
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:47,058
Did you think

642
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,900
I did it out of kindness?

643
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:52,649
Just because I was
nice to your turtle?

644
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:53,816
It is more than just that.

645
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:58,034
It gave me enough hope
to come and talk to you

646
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:00,947
despite the hatred and
distrust you have toward me.

647
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:05,790
Forget it.

648
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:08,752
I guess you will not be
going to North Fortress

649
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,956
seeing that you have been
reading about the fire bird.

650
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:12,258
What if I do go?

651
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:16,796
You know how dangerous a fire bird
is, and yet you are going to leave?

652
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:19,095
I am glad I kept this book open.

653
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:21,892
I managed to see that
expression on your face.

654
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:25,227
If I did not hate you so much,

655
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:29,273
I might have even thought that
you were worried about the world.

656
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:34,154
You possess a power so strong,

657
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,616
yet you are no better
than me or my turtle.

658
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:40,618
That is because there is not a
single thing I wish to protect.

659
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:41,621
Listen, Jang Uk.

660
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:44,502
Do you remember what you said when
you saved everyone in the barrier?

661
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,766
You told me that it is better
to die than to do nothing,

662
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:48,210
just as your master
has taught you.

663
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:55,047
Back then, you were full of vigor
even though you had lost your energy.

664
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:58,506
But now you are dead despite
the power you possess.

665
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:00,014
Fine.

666
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:01,595
Do absolutely nothing.

667
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:04,680
After all, you are dead.

668
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:19,530
"Hope"?

669
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:38,007
The tree that I remember
was not this small.

670
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:41,183
It was a lot bigger and taller.

671
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:46,523
I was on top of that tree.

672
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:49,694
I was there all by myself,

673
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:51,807
and that memory

674
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:54,483
is definitely mine.

675
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,500
I want to climb up
that tree again.

676
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:39,109
Young Master!

677
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:40,824
Young Master, are you all right?

678
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:42,873
Open the door.

679
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:44,408
Open this door!

680
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:45,831
I am all right. Just go.

681
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:48,199
Why are you not going to
Jinyowon when you are in pain?

682
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:50,503
Fine.

683
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,371
Then I will go see
Jin Ho-gyeong again.

684
00:45:58,046 --> 00:45:59,586
What are you thinking?

685
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,260
Why are you doing
this to yourself?

686
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:07,466
So I can do what
I can to make up

687
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:09,734
for my ongoing regrets.

688
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:13,768
Because that pain…

689
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:19,234
is much greater than
the pain I feel now.

690
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:23,034
You gave me a chance to do that.

691
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:25,162
I thank you for that.

692
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:29,872
So you do not need…

693
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:37,343
to do anything more for me.

694
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:40,588
You have done enough.

695
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:45,837
Young Lady Heo gave me
some medicine for my pain.

696
00:46:47,804 --> 00:46:48,974
I will bring it to you.

697
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:53,186
Make sure you take
it, Young Master.

698
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:07,008
The fact that they are still
alive with the blood parasite

699
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:08,532
in the core of their energy

700
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:11,447
shows that they have a
very high pain tolerance.

701
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:13,329
However,

702
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:17,044
if the blood parasite goes mad after
its energy surges the wrong way,

703
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:20,455
the pain will drive them crazy
and eventually kill them.

704
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:24,590
They will need my help
if they wish to live.

705
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:27,925
So they will not be able
to expose Bu-yeon's secret.

706
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:31,181
But is there even a way to
get rid of the blood parasite

707
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:33,949
once it enters the
core of one's energy?

708
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:40,401
Insects are eaten…

709
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:43,651
by birds.

710
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:53,538
Jin Bu-yeon really seems like a
priestess with amazing divine powers.

711
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,620
She has started to
regain her divine powers?

712
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:57,475
You told her that once
she regains her memories,

713
00:47:57,499 --> 00:47:59,209
her divine powers
will come back.

714
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:00,133
No.

715
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:02,710
If she regains her divine
powers, her memories will return.

716
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:04,875
Is there a difference?

717
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:07,625
Have her find the earthenware.

718
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:19,185
Once Jin Bu-yeon regains
her divine powers,

719
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:22,442
Naksu will also retrieve
her old memories

720
00:48:22,941 --> 00:48:25,401
and will eventually be
rejected by that body.

721
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:38,004
Ta-da.

722
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,831
I was given the Spirit
Plaque of Songrim.

723
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:42,437
They said my skills are on
par with Jeongjingak mages,

724
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:43,563
so I am allowed to enter freely.

725
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:45,917
It took me so much
effort to earn that,

726
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:49,006
but seeing you with it makes it
feel like it was all for nothing.

727
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:50,392
It took you a lot of effort?

728
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:52,299
I guess you got bad grades.

729
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:53,948
What was your class
rank when you trained?

730
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:58,642
As soon as I opened my gate of energy,
I reached Chisu faster than anyone.

731
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:00,267
You must have trained very hard.

732
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:01,904
That is because
someone made sure

733
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:05,484
that my life was put at risk
if I did not do my best.

734
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:06,567
Who?

735
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:09,070
My…

736
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:12,238
master.

737
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:19,959
My harsh master always put me
on the brink and pushed me.

738
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,750
Thanks to that,

739
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:23,503
I learned to climb
back up again.

740
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:26,049
My master never allowed me

741
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:28,012
to quit and do nothing.

742
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:31,718
It is better to die
than do nothing.

743
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:37,932
What?

744
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:40,854
Did I confuse you again?

745
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:45,065
Now I really have no idea
who it is that is talking.

746
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:49,188
But it is strange.

747
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:51,277
I have heard that
too many times today.

748
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:53,174
Maybe because I
thought of quitting.

749
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:54,568
What do you mean?

750
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,740
Were you going to
quit everything?

751
00:49:58,829 --> 00:49:59,829
Yes.

752
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:02,363
I figured I finally found a way

753
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:05,712
to get rid of the
burden I carry.

754
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:09,797
Is it…

755
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:12,881
that burdensome for you?

756
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:22,599
Lord Park told me
I was incredible

757
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:24,556
as he gave me this.

758
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:26,646
I will slowly become
more and more powerful,

759
00:50:28,024 --> 00:50:29,284
and I will use that power…

760
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:33,359
to protect you.

761
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:36,655
I am also starting
to get confused

762
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:38,826
about what it is

763
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:41,657
that I really want from you.

764
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:43,998
I plan

765
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:46,038
to find my own room.

766
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:51,423
I will find out who I really am and
decorate my room with my own traits.

767
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:55,134
I hope…

768
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:58,904
that makes it easier
for you to find me.

769
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:12,190
I will keep you warm

770
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:14,783
and help you rest comfortably.

771
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:39,894
I barely managed to advance
the date of the rite.

772
00:51:39,971 --> 00:51:42,471
But you threw everything
into the lake?

773
00:51:43,308 --> 00:51:45,411
I had no other choice. I could
not let Songrim find out.

774
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:49,475
I will have to put So-i back
in charge of importing goods.

775
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:52,531
Take him out of here.

776
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:55,029
So-i has been gone from
the gambling den for days.

777
00:51:55,111 --> 00:51:56,821
She will forever
be under my control

778
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:58,775
as long as the blood
parasite lives inside her.

779
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:01,451
Wait until she shows
up and bring her here.

780
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:02,535
Yes, Gwanju.

781
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:12,044
Show them this letter.

782
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:14,701
Then they will take care of you.

783
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:17,759
When will you visit
Jin Ho-gyeong?

784
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:19,143
You have no time to waste.

785
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:20,928
I know.

786
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:22,968
I hope you come back alive.

787
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:28,309
You will be returning to Seoho
Fortress once you are better, right?

788
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:34,108
Have a safe trip.

789
00:52:58,049 --> 00:52:59,379
I am trying to pick

790
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:01,755
a perfect date for our wedding.

791
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:03,602
Let us get married quickly.

792
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:04,760
All right.

793
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:10,133
I also need to pick a wedding
date for Young Master Jang.

794
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:13,113
Let us invite
every single person

795
00:53:13,189 --> 00:53:16,229
in your family from Wol
Fortress to our wedding.

796
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:19,362
I will send over a big boat.

797
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:20,446
Thank you.

798
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:24,740
Who should I invite to
Young Master Jang's wedding?

799
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:28,412
He has no family, but I do not
want the place to feel empty.

800
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:33,591
Maidservant Kim, why are
you peeling chestnuts?

801
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:35,418
Young Master Jang
loves chestnut rice.

802
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:39,089
I feel sad.

803
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:41,261
It seems to you,

804
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:43,255
Uk always comes first.

805
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:46,635
That is because he
is my young master.

806
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:49,024
I am also concerned about him.

807
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:52,599
Here.

808
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:55,687
If Uk and I were
drowning like this,

809
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:57,484
who would you save first?

810
00:53:59,235 --> 00:54:00,855
Why would I save either of you?

811
00:54:01,446 --> 00:54:03,406
You two could easily swim out.

812
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:04,870
What if we could not?

813
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:07,830
What if we were both struggling
to get out of the water?

814
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:11,161
Whose name would you call first?

815
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:14,375
Well…

816
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:18,247
- Ja...
- Of course,

817
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:20,798
you would call Jang Uk first.

818
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:25,471
You would only be
concerned about Uk.

819
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:26,723
You would not care

820
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:29,434
about me at all.

821
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:30,516
Look who is talking.

822
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,600
You once said you would
seal the door shut

823
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:34,226
even if I end up dying inside.

824
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:36,152
- When did I say that?
- Unbelievable.

825
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,030
Then let me ask
you one more time.

826
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:44,237
Let us say I was trapped
inside a very dangerous room,

827
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:47,372
and you had to seal the door.

828
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:51,960
Then would you seal
that door or not?

829
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:57,544
How urgent is the situation?

830
00:54:58,211 --> 00:54:59,631
If I did not seal the door,

831
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:02,922
would the entire
world be in danger?

832
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:04,718
Listen to yourself!

833
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:06,551
How could you even care
about the situation

834
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:08,636
when I would be
the one in danger?

835
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:10,562
I would die.

836
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,440
Do not speak of such a
heartbreaking situation.

837
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:15,602
You…

838
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:17,981
will never be in danger.

839
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:20,732
I will always be
there to protect you.

840
00:55:21,943 --> 00:55:22,943
Goodness.

841
00:55:23,361 --> 00:55:25,911
Even if you decide
to seal that door,

842
00:55:26,781 --> 00:55:30,291
I know how heartbreaking
it will be for you,

843
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:32,537
so it does not upset me so much.

844
00:55:33,955 --> 00:55:37,245
So just know that even if I call
Young Master Jang's name before yours,

845
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:43,344
it is not because my love for
you is in any way smaller.

846
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:45,876
I was a fool.

847
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:47,468
That question

848
00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:53,271
also implied that you had to watch
the death of your beloved one.

849
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:57,311
Both should be saved.

850
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:01,150
You should save them
both in any way possible.

851
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:09,116
Neither of them will ever drown.

852
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:41,019
Tear out the heart and
break it to pieces.

853
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:44,281
You wish to go to Danhyanggok?

854
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:46,113
Why?

855
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:50,284
I heard there is a gigantic tree
there, and I wish to see it myself.

856
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:52,365
There is a gigantic tree there.

857
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:54,988
I went there with Uk, Yul, and…

858
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,620
We went there together.

859
00:56:58,706 --> 00:57:01,036
The tree I wish to see is mine.

860
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:02,246
What?

861
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:05,671
I remember a very big tree,

862
00:57:06,297 --> 00:57:07,507
and I wish to see

863
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:09,932
if it really exists.

864
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:14,811
I am not sure if we are
talking about the same tree,

865
00:57:15,473 --> 00:57:17,993
but it is located somewhere high
up, so it will be easy to find.

866
00:57:18,017 --> 00:57:21,347
I would love to take
you there myself,

867
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:22,308
but I am too busy.

868
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:24,937
I could have someone
escort you to Danhyanggok.

869
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:27,034
I will ask if I need someone.

870
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:28,860
Are you going to Danhyanggok?

871
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:33,616
Yul knows his way around
Danhyanggok a lot better than I do.

872
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,200
He went there often as a kid.

873
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:36,865
I also wanted to visit.

874
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:38,961
Shall we go together?

875
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:42,078
Great, Yul can take you
there. You should go with him.

876
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:44,037
I heard it is a dangerous place.

877
00:57:45,086 --> 00:57:46,086
Is that all right?

878
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:47,629
Yes.

879
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:50,132
Let us go there together.

880
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:57,719
THE FIRE BIRD

881
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:03,733
It looks like these people

882
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:06,193
are trying to do the same
by waking the fire bird.

883
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:09,154
You know how dangerous a fire bird
is, and yet you are going to leave?

884
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:14,068
It is better to die
than do nothing.

885
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:39,393
I do not have that
stone with me right now.

886
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:41,484
If she really does not have it,

887
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:45,232
it should be
somewhere in the room.

888
00:58:55,156 --> 00:58:56,156
What are you doing?

889
00:58:57,242 --> 00:58:58,452
You came awfully quick.

890
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:01,908
What is it?

891
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:04,099
Are you having trouble sleeping?
Do you want to sleep in my arms?

892
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:05,583
How will that help me sleep?

893
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:07,247
I am not here because
of what you said.

894
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:08,415
I am here to check

895
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:11,837
if you really have not been
carrying that item around.

896
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:22,644
Look. I kept it in here.

897
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:26,353
So it really was you

898
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:28,864
who said those words?

899
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:31,275
I find it strange too,

900
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:34,547
which is why I plan to go
to Danhyanggok tomorrow.

901
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:35,781
Danhyanggok?

902
00:59:35,863 --> 00:59:36,993
To see a tree.

903
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:40,027
You told me that the tree
you mentioned really exists.

904
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:45,579
I want to see if the tree I
remember also exists there.

905
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:48,843
That jade makes things
even more confusing.

906
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:50,549
But one thing is for sure.

907
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:51,668
I knew about that tree

908
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:54,629
way before I even met you.

909
00:59:57,427 --> 01:00:00,507
Seeing that tree for myself will
help me find out who I really am.

910
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:04,097
All right, go ahead.

911
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:05,983
- I will...
- I will be going with Yul.

912
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:10,397
- With Yul?
- He offered to go with me.

913
01:00:10,481 --> 01:00:11,611
He knows the place well.

914
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:15,068
Why would you bother him?

915
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:16,953
He also wanted to see the tree.

916
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:18,660
He is only being
nice as my friend.

917
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:20,370
He just feels bad
about saying no.

918
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,910
- He is my friend too.
- No, he is my friend.

919
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:24,388
You cannot be friends
with my friend.

920
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:26,122
- Why not?
- Yul is my friend.

921
01:00:26,205 --> 01:00:28,183
If he is your friend, that
means we are friends too.

922
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:29,077
Can we not even be friends?

923
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:31,687
How can someone who hugs me and
puts me to bed be just a friend?

924
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:55,817
Have fun

925
01:00:57,278 --> 01:00:59,028
at Danhyanggok with your friend.

926
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:04,826
I am fine with you
being Yul's friend.

927
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:21,259
I must be crazy.

928
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:37,651
So this is Danhyanggok.

929
01:01:37,735 --> 01:01:39,065
What a wonderful view.

930
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:44,741
Did you say you came
here often as a kid?

931
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:46,660
Yes.

932
01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:49,906
This is where we first met.

933
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:52,707
We met when we were young?

934
01:01:56,295 --> 01:01:57,795
I came here to see you.

935
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:03,217
I did not even care
that I had hurt my leg,

936
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:06,309
and I was not afraid
of getting scolded…

937
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:13,645
because I liked you a lot.

938
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:17,902
I could not stop
feeling this way,

939
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:21,463
so I did nothing even
though I knew who you were.

940
01:02:21,487 --> 01:02:23,407
And that left me with
agonizing regrets.

941
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:28,119
This time, I am glad I
recognized you first.

942
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:32,583
I finally have a chance
to do what I need to do.

943
01:02:58,524 --> 01:03:00,944
Young Master. Young Master Seo.

944
01:03:04,822 --> 01:03:07,032
You seemed to be lost
in your thoughts.

945
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:09,236
Master Heo wishes to see you.

946
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:16,418
Yun-ok told me

947
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:18,921
that you helped hide
that girl named So-i.

948
01:03:19,003 --> 01:03:20,213
She is already gone.

949
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:22,465
I sent her far away,
so do not worry.

950
01:03:23,674 --> 01:03:24,674
Why…

951
01:03:25,218 --> 01:03:27,638
have you been avoiding me?

952
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:32,230
Do you still resent me for
sending you to Seoho Fortress?

953
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:34,495
You had to carry on the
Seo family's bloodline,

954
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:37,559
so I did not want you involved
in anything regarding Naksu.

955
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:38,767
I know.

956
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:45,913
You do not look so well.

957
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:47,948
Let me examine you.

958
01:03:48,032 --> 01:03:50,162
- Follow me inside.
- I need to go somewhere.

959
01:03:50,785 --> 01:03:51,985
I will come by…

960
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:56,825
once I return.

961
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:58,786
All right. Make sure you do.

962
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:01,996
If you do not come,
I will hunt you down.

963
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:04,214
I will.

964
01:04:05,633 --> 01:04:06,803
I am sorry, Master Heo.

965
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:09,636
I wish you good health.

966
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:22,532
Madam, what made
you so concerned

967
01:04:22,608 --> 01:04:24,068
that you decided to return?

968
01:04:24,151 --> 01:04:27,151
We shall leave as soon as I
check that he goes to Jinyowon.

969
01:04:27,238 --> 01:04:30,528
Why do you care
so much about him?

970
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:32,951
Do you like him?

971
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:40,591
The only kind of
world I ever knew

972
01:04:42,461 --> 01:04:44,131
was filled with
filth and darkness.

973
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:48,759
I saw him when I
was swindling people

974
01:04:50,595 --> 01:04:51,965
by pretending to be blind.

975
01:04:55,266 --> 01:04:57,016
And for the first time ever…

976
01:04:59,854 --> 01:05:01,114
the world seemed…

977
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:05,106
clean and bright.

978
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:24,252
That is just

979
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:26,421
how I felt.

980
01:05:26,505 --> 01:05:28,465
All right, then.
Let us go check.

981
01:05:29,967 --> 01:05:31,337
I will go buy us some noodles.

982
01:05:57,370 --> 01:06:01,040
It seems like the mages of Cheonbugwan
have taken over while I was gone.

983
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:17,517
You were trying to run
away, were you not?

984
01:06:18,182 --> 01:06:21,522
It would be impossible to do that
with that blood parasite inside you.

985
01:06:22,103 --> 01:06:24,483
Did you perhaps remove
it from your body?

986
01:06:37,284 --> 01:06:40,044
Tell me the truth if you
wish to spare your life.

987
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:42,461
Did you take the blood
parasite out of your body?

988
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:51,127
Maidservant Kim packed us lunch.

989
01:06:52,425 --> 01:06:53,925
What beautiful weather.

990
01:06:54,593 --> 01:06:56,033
It is like we are
going on a picnic.

991
01:06:57,763 --> 01:06:59,143
Did you say goodbye to Uk?

992
01:06:59,724 --> 01:07:00,724
Yes, I did.

993
01:07:00,766 --> 01:07:02,886
He told me to have
fun with my friend.

994
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:07,730
How is your condition?

995
01:07:08,816 --> 01:07:10,106
Do you feel better?

996
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:12,242
I did what you asked
and did not tell Uk.

997
01:07:16,991 --> 01:07:18,031
I am sorry.

998
01:07:19,785 --> 01:07:20,945
Young Master Seo!

999
01:07:23,914 --> 01:07:25,544
What are you doing here?

1000
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:27,214
- Did you not get on the boat?
- I…

1001
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:29,343
Madam So-i was captured
by Cheonbugwan mages.

1002
01:07:30,588 --> 01:07:31,798
What is a blood parasite?

1003
01:07:32,506 --> 01:07:35,426
They keep beating her
saying she no longer has it.

1004
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:37,432
Is she at the gambling den?

1005
01:07:37,511 --> 01:07:38,511
Yes.

1006
01:07:45,102 --> 01:07:46,942
Whose body holds
the blood parasite?

1007
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:48,611
Who did you give
the medicine to?

1008
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:51,940
I told you, I took the medicine!

1009
01:07:53,944 --> 01:07:55,704
I thought it would
be good for me.

1010
01:07:58,199 --> 01:07:59,329
Just tell me the truth.

1011
01:08:00,034 --> 01:08:02,414
If I take you to Gwanju, he
will crush you to pieces.

1012
01:08:10,795 --> 01:08:11,835
Put that down.

1013
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:14,971
Put that back down!

1014
01:08:15,049 --> 01:08:18,139
Put that down! Put it back!

1015
01:08:19,011 --> 01:08:20,051
Put that down!

1016
01:08:20,137 --> 01:08:22,807
No! Put that down!

1017
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:31,938
A blood parasite?

1018
01:08:32,024 --> 01:08:33,154
What is that?

1019
01:08:33,234 --> 01:08:34,784
I am not sure.

1020
01:08:35,653 --> 01:08:36,863
But that is what I heard.

1021
01:08:38,656 --> 01:08:40,866
There is something
I have not told you.

1022
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:46,250
He told me not to tell you.

1023
01:08:51,669 --> 01:08:52,959
But Seo Yul is severely ill.

1024
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:58,380
I saw an unusual form
of energy inside him.

1025
01:08:59,176 --> 01:09:01,596
I think it was the
blood parasite.

1026
01:09:09,645 --> 01:09:11,706
Take out all the items from
Cheonbugwan that So-i brought.

1027
01:09:11,730 --> 01:09:12,730
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

1028
01:09:45,931 --> 01:09:48,431
Were you the person that
So-i tried to protect?

1029
01:09:48,517 --> 01:09:49,767
I need to take her with me.

1030
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:50,852
Move aside.

1031
01:09:52,146 --> 01:09:54,726
So-i knows too many
of Gwanju's secrets.

1032
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:56,895
If I let Songrim take her,
my life will be at stake.

1033
01:09:56,984 --> 01:09:57,984
I cannot let you do that.

1034
01:09:58,485 --> 01:09:59,965
Cheonbugwan has been
looking for her.

1035
01:10:04,366 --> 01:10:05,236
I told you to move aside.

1036
01:10:05,326 --> 01:10:07,366
Why would a man like you
protect someone like her?

1037
01:10:07,453 --> 01:10:08,663
I will not allow you

1038
01:10:09,496 --> 01:10:11,286
to take her to Jin
Mu of Cheonbugwan.

1039
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:33,351
I must end it quickly.

1040
01:10:34,104 --> 01:10:36,064
Using too much of my energy
will put me in danger.

1041
01:10:44,573 --> 01:10:45,573
The blood parasite?

1042
01:10:48,702 --> 01:10:50,002
The blood parasite given to So-i

1043
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:52,825
is now inside Seo Yul.

1044
01:11:58,647 --> 01:11:59,647
So-i.

1045
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:13,370
I am glad that before I die…

1046
01:12:15,414 --> 01:12:16,754
I can see you

1047
01:12:18,834 --> 01:12:20,464
who made the world

1048
01:12:23,464 --> 01:12:24,674
seem clean and bright.

1049
01:12:29,887 --> 01:12:30,887
Please…

1050
01:12:32,973 --> 01:12:34,273
stay alive.

1051
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:03,712
I do not know how a nobleman like you
got involved with a girl like her.

1052
01:13:04,588 --> 01:13:06,338
But now that things
have come to this,

1053
01:13:06,924 --> 01:13:08,224
I cannot spare you.

1054
01:14:53,780 --> 01:14:54,780
Yul.

1055
01:14:56,366 --> 01:14:57,406
Yul.

1056
01:14:59,411 --> 01:15:00,411
Uk.

1057
01:15:03,457 --> 01:15:04,457
I am sorry.

1058
01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:40,237
Not a single person…

1059
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:43,834
will be able to walk
out of here alive.

1060
01:16:08,647 --> 01:16:11,567
ALCHEMY OF SOULS PART 2

1061
01:16:12,150 --> 01:16:14,030
Who put that thing
in So-i's body?

1062
01:16:14,111 --> 01:16:15,451
Was it Jin Mu's doing?

1063
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:18,565
Stop Jang Uk from
entering Cheonbugwan!

1064
01:16:21,118 --> 01:16:22,698
If Seo Yul dies,

1065
01:16:22,786 --> 01:16:25,746
it will start a great clash
between Songrim and Cheonbugwan.

1066
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:30,000
She said she did not want to
find out, so I plan to show her.

1067
01:16:31,128 --> 01:16:32,708
Only three breaths.

1068
01:16:32,796 --> 01:16:35,506
You said you have no recollection
of who you are, right?

1069
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:38,931
The blue marks bloomed
in her eyes like flowers.

1070
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:46,440
