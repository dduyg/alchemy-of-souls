1
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,625
Is it possible to treat soul shifters

2
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:55,852
and turn them back into humans
even after they have run wild?

3
00:00:57,046 --> 00:01:00,367
We are not treating him
to turn him back into a human being.

4
00:01:00,867 --> 00:01:04,725
We are merely trying to keep him
conscious enough for him to speak.

5
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,484
So you are not looking for a way
to bring them back.

6
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,015
Once a soul shifter runs wild,
they are no longer human.

7
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,239
They are monsters.

8
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,038
They either feed off
the energy of human beings,

9
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:23,562
or they get petrified.
It is one or the other.

10
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:32,298
We cannot stop them from running wild.

11
00:01:36,852 --> 00:01:38,009
The ice stone.

12
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:42,268
I heard the ice stone
carries the power of Hwansu.

13
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,556
Maybe that could stop them
from running wild.

14
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,517
Yes, maybe. However,

15
00:01:49,183 --> 00:01:53,149
that kind of power
should be forbidden to mankind.

16
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:08,510
It looks like it is going to rain.

17
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:13,299
I did not even get to use
the energy of the Soul Ejector.

18
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:16,343
It looks like it will
get washed away by the rain.

19
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:19,388
Can the energy of the Soul Ejector
disappear due to the rain?

20
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,852
The power of the ice stone
came from the skies.

21
00:02:21,978 --> 00:02:24,694
Thus, its power can
also be taken away by the skies.

22
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:48,626
I wonder if that girl tried to summon
the power of the skies

23
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,296
to make the ice stone disappear.

24
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,591
Jin Bu-yeon.

25
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:02,099
If she were alive,
she would have become a great priestess

26
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:05,351
who could even control
the energy of the skies.

27
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,961
You are fine.

28
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,507
Look. I am all right too.
You did not run wild.

29
00:03:52,914 --> 00:03:55,120
The ceiling above the constellation basin
has opened.

30
00:03:55,584 --> 00:03:58,010
- Was it not always open?
- No.

31
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:00,155
It may seem like it,

32
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,783
but I was told that it was not.

33
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:05,243
Who told you that? Your father?

34
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:09,610
He said the only way to open
the ceiling above the constellation basin

35
00:04:09,746 --> 00:04:12,532
is by the energy
of a constellation recorder mage.

36
00:04:12,802 --> 00:04:14,553
How did this open?

37
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:18,007
In any case, it seems like
we did something we should not have.

38
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,557
I wonder what happened.

39
00:04:21,535 --> 00:04:22,741
It was me.

40
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,093
I opened it.

41
00:04:26,893 --> 00:04:28,809
My energy seeped inside the water.

42
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,562
Just like at Lake Gyeongcheondaeho

43
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,028
and inside the Mirror of Longing.

44
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:38,361
This water enabled me
to get my energy back.

45
00:04:57,075 --> 00:04:58,464
What do you mean lightning struck?

46
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:01,300
There was a loud noise coming from
the Constellation Recording room.

47
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:04,560
That is where Eunuch Kim
and Jang Uk are right now.

48
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,484
It is the energy of the Soul Ejector.

49
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:18,069
I felt the same dark energy
when Gil-ju attempted to shift souls.

50
00:05:20,509 --> 00:05:21,737
What is the matter?

51
00:05:22,008 --> 00:05:24,915
I cannot see just like how I could not
when I came out of the mirror.

52
00:05:25,736 --> 00:05:27,321
I feel dizzy and nauseous.

53
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,899
Jin Mu will be back soon. We must leave.

54
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,462
Oh, right. The door.

55
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:48,442
The door is locked with his energy,
the constellation basin is damaged,

56
00:05:48,527 --> 00:05:50,073
and the soul shifter is dead.

57
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:52,518
This is bad.

58
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,040
There is an exit for servants
next to the constellation basin.

59
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,321
My father used to take me out
through that exit.

60
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,954
But we will still be inside Cheonbugwan.

61
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,746
You cannot see,
and I do not know my way around here.

62
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:13,372
If we get lost,
the mages here will catch us.

63
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,708
If we stay here,
Jin Mu will come and kill us.

64
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,668
I am not strong enough to defeat him.

65
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:24,100
I am going to call my savior for help.

66
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,225
- Your savior?
- It is someone I know.

67
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:32,761
A person who will come running over
with a fluttering heart.

68
00:06:33,496 --> 00:06:35,082
My savior.

69
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:01,335
Uk, you must be mad.

70
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,552
You heard a loud noise inside?

71
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:11,680
Yes, but you told us not to go inside,
so we did not.

72
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,610
Yeom-su, follow me.
The rest can stay and guard the door.

73
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,376
Jang Uk broke the barrier and escaped.

74
00:07:32,545 --> 00:07:33,671
Assistant Gwanju.

75
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:35,494
The constellation basinâ€¦

76
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,545
What happened to the constellation basin?

77
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,001
I must find him.

78
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:43,081
I cannot let Uk leave this place alive.

79
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,339
Move this body to the Secret Room.

80
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:48,179
- Do not let anybody see you.
- Yes, sir.

81
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,809
Seal all the exits of Cheonbugwan.

82
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,819
Then find Jang Uk and his maid.

83
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,772
If they try to fight, you may kill them.

84
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:02,982
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

85
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:21,293
Uk will never manage to find his way
out of this maze-like place.

86
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,086
He will get lost and get caught.

87
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:27,423
But then again,

88
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:32,303
maybe he knew he would get lost
and just decided to hide instead.

89
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,391
You almost fooled me.

90
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,892
Are you here?

91
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,522
I noticed you broke
the water barrier I had made.

92
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,772
How about I make one with fire this time?

93
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:50,070
If I surround this place with fire,

94
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:53,040
maybe it will get hot enough

95
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,284
for you to finally show yourself.

96
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:59,534
Try to convince me like you did earlier
instead of trying to blackmail me.

97
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,758
Why should I when I have nothing to lose?

98
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,963
You are a trespasser who came unannounced
and broke the constellation basin.

99
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,090
And as the Assistant Gwanju
of Cheonbugwan,

100
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:12,260
it is my duty to get rid of trespassers.

101
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:18,265
You are being too harsh
to a guest who came bearing gifts.

102
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:21,810
Are you angry that we turned
your friend here into stone?

103
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,110
What friend?

104
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:28,317
I do not recall seeing anyone else here
other than you, your maid, and myself.

105
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:31,195
I see you plan to hide that mass of rock.

106
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,487
But here is some bad news.

107
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:37,495
- You will get caught.
- That will not happen.

108
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:40,874
Because you and your maid will soon die.

109
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,045
Now show yourself.

110
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:44,755
Come on out!

111
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,737
Did you see it?

112
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:16,114
A bolt of lightning struck
near Cheonbugwan.

113
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,784
Cheonbugwan is right next to the palace.

114
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,537
I must go and see
if everyone is all right.

115
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,455
That bolt of lightning was enormous.

116
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:26,085
I do hope Jin Mu got hit by it.

117
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,603
It is a pity.

118
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,103
I bet you came here elated,

119
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,397
hoping to become the Gwanju one day.

120
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,065
But instead, your death awaits.

121
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,025
You are one unlucky man.

122
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,978
That is too bad.

123
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,280
If I were to die,

124
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,615
you would have easily become the Gwanju.

125
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,284
However, that will not happen.

126
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,494
What?

127
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,750
Have you heard of the yin-and-yang jade?

128
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:09,626
It consists of
a pair of red and blue jade.

129
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,296
If you fill one with energy,
the other reacts to it.

130
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,836
If they are close by,

131
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,673
the two will find each other
no matter what.

132
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:18,856
What about that?

133
00:11:18,992 --> 00:11:20,578
Of the two,

134
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,266
the blue jade is
in the Crown Prince's possession.

135
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,351
That is a nice jade.

136
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:28,979
I got it in exchange for ten gold toads.

137
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,359
Is it something valuable?

138
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,026
So what if he has that?

139
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,320
I had the other red jade.

140
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:39,080
I filled it with energy,
which means the Crown Prince

141
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,540
is on his way here to find it.

142
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,171
Are you going to kill me and take it?

143
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:57,299
I figured you would do that,
so I hid it somewhere else.

144
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:02,137
I filled the red jade
with energy and hid it

145
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,307
inside the robe
of the eunuch that ran wild.

146
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:17,775
The Crown Prince is
probably on his way to that mass of rock.

147
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,456
Imagine how he would react
when he sees that body.

148
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:26,957
Gosh, he will get quite the shock.

149
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,426
Cheonbugwan.

150
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,011
Jang Uk is somewhere inside Cheonbugwan.

151
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:54,142
Rather than killing me,

152
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,023
you should go stop the Crown Prince.

153
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,248
I will be back.

154
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,826
You will never be able
to leave this place anyway.

155
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,652
- Where did you put Eunuch Kim?
- In the Secret Room.

156
00:13:20,737 --> 00:13:23,215
If you give me your order,
I will take his body outside.

157
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:34,189
Whereâ€¦

158
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:40,733
It is not here.
That little punk fooled me again.

159
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:45,031
Assistant Gwanju, sir.

160
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:48,031
I know you ordered not to let anyone in,
but we had no choice.

161
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,163
What? Is the Crown Prince here?

162
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,373
Yes.

163
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,629
So he was not lying about
the yin-and-yang jade.

164
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,227
Assistant Gwanju.

165
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:17,527
Did a eunuch serving the royal family
really turn out to be a soul shifter?

166
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,195
And I heard you tried to kill Uk
to keep that a secret.

167
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,445
That is a big misunderstanding,
Your Royal Highness.

168
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,527
You even tried

169
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:06,238
to use my maid
as prey for that soul shifter.

170
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:10,368
You better have a good excuse
for this to be a misunderstanding.

171
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:25,507
Are you asking about Cho Chung,
the man who used to work

172
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,927
as a constellation mage at Cheonbugwan?

173
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:32,055
I heard Jang Gang
and Cho Chung were very close.

174
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,305
Yes, they were.

175
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,729
They were very good friends.

176
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,064
He visited our home often.

177
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:42,196
He made funny jokes,
and he was a warm-hearted man.

178
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:44,860
Cho Chung got involved with sorcery,

179
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,571
and that eventually wiped out
his entire family.

180
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,361
He was such a good man.

181
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:53,535
It is still hard to believe
that such a thing happened to him.

182
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:58,794
Cho Chung had a daughter.
Did you also know her?

183
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,127
Yes, I remember her.

184
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:05,255
She was always right beside her father
and was very close with him too.

185
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,505
I heard she also disappeared
amid the chaos.

186
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:09,384
I am guessing

187
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,600
that she is dead.

188
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,764
Why do you think so?

189
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:18,894
Master Jang Gang tried to find that girl
for a very long time.

190
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,981
If she was still alive,
he would have found her already,

191
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,151
unless someone was purposely hiding her.

192
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:27,822
Madam Do-hwa had passed away.

193
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:30,697
His best friend had
ended up in such a state.

194
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:34,117
Master Jang was not
in his right mind back then.

195
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:38,031
He blamed himself for both their deaths

196
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,296
and was in great agony.

197
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,835
He left home
to find his friend's daughter,

198
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,255
and I thought
he would come back once he did.

199
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:47,798
Butâ€¦

200
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:52,390
It is odd that he would leave home
for 20 years just to find a little girl.

201
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:55,722
I am starting to worry that maybe
he has not returned

202
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,392
because of another reason.

203
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:01,602
If he had found the girl 20 years ago,

204
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,898
her life would not have been so hard.

205
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:08,944
And Jang Gang would not have had
to feel so guilty.

206
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,570
"Guilty"?

207
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:14,750
Are you implying that what Master Jang did
to his friend was wrong?

208
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,327
He punished someone who practiced sorcery.

209
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,371
That was the right thing to do as a mage.

210
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:23,541
No matter how close they may have been,
it was not wrong of him to punish him.

211
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:28,001
You cannot judge what is right or wrong
merely based on the things you see.

212
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,966
There are stories to everything.

213
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,211
And fate is made up of
many stories and relationships.

214
00:17:34,296 --> 00:17:36,221
Are you implying that
the ill-fated relationship

215
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:41,351
between the Cho family and the Jang family
has not yet ended?

216
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,021
By any chance,

217
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:49,024
are you saying that a member
of the Cho family is in this household?

218
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,328
Did Songrim find the girl?

219
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,206
That girlâ€¦

220
00:17:58,368 --> 00:17:59,664
Is dead.

221
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,216
I see.

222
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,215
Poor thing.

223
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,382
I should hold a memorial service for her.

224
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:15,889
Maidservant Kim.

225
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,430
You are very warm-hearted.

226
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,473
It is not a gesture of kindness.

227
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:23,853
I just do not wish her spirit
to remain in this world

228
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,855
and harass Young Master Jang.

229
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:30,608
What if her spirit
is indeed lingering by Uk?

230
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:33,653
I should get rid of it.
She would have become an evil spirit.

231
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,693
I cannot let such a thing linger by him.

232
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,075
An evil spirit?

233
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,539
Where is Mu-deok?

234
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:45,959
Mu-deok?

235
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:49,622
I sent her to Cheonbugwan
to run an errand.

236
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,171
Are you all right? Can you see?

237
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,770
Yes, I can see now.

238
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:02,307
And you, Young Master?

239
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,642
Did you get hurt anywhere?

240
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:05,852
I am all right.

241
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,313
What does it mean when two people
share something that should be a pair?

242
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,733
It means they are married or a couple.

243
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:17,393
Songrim's leader has come to Cheonbugwan
as you have ordered, Your Royal Highness.

244
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,639
You came to Cheonbugwan

245
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,931
to give honey biscuits
to the Assistant Gwanju?

246
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:46,971
Yes, I heard you two had an argument
over honey biscuits.

247
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,771
Maidservant Kim did not want him
to stay upset,

248
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,856
so I brought what she had sent him.

249
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,486
What a feeble excuse.

250
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:55,568
The leader of Songrim

251
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:58,788
and Assistant Gwanju of Cheonbugwan
fighting over honey biscuits?

252
00:20:00,091 --> 00:20:02,777
Even if that were true,
you could have left right away.

253
00:20:02,862 --> 00:20:04,987
Why were you in the main room
with the constellation basin?

254
00:20:05,072 --> 00:20:07,342
I wanted to see the constellation basin.

255
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:10,713
However, I ended up seeing something
that I should not have.

256
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:15,130
Are you sure you saw a soul shifter?

257
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,675
Yes, he locked me inside a barrier
to hide that fact

258
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,302
and threw Mu-deok to
the soul shifter so he could feed on her.

259
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,972
He is lying.

260
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:27,517
Jang Uk entered the main room
of Cheonbugwan without permission

261
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,519
and damaged the constellation basin.

262
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,938
Now that he finds himself in trouble,

263
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:35,068
he is making up an absurd lie
about a soul shifter.

264
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,528
I am sure it was a soul shifter.

265
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,572
He ran wild and got petrified.

266
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,545
My maid and I both saw it.

267
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,951
When I arrived,
I did not see the body of a soul shifter.

268
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,619
He probably hid it somewhere.

269
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:48,454
You need to block all the exits

270
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:51,504
and find the body of the soul shifter
before he takes it out.

271
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:58,714
I guess the truth will be revealed
once we find the soul shifter's body.

272
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,429
I shall summon the mages of Songrim
and investigate Cheonbugwan.

273
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:07,932
No. I cannot let him
search through Cheongbugwan

274
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:10,472
based on a ridiculous lie.

275
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,449
Jang Uk.

276
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:20,528
Did you say the soul shifter
was a royal eunuch?

277
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:21,487
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

278
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:25,200
I saw him beside the Queen
the day you came to Songrim for a duel.

279
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,827
Eunuch Oh,
which eunuch was there that day?

280
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:30,627
Eunuch Kim, Your Royal Highness.
He serves the Queen.

281
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,966
Then we just need to check
whether or not he is in the palace.

282
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,045
Go and check if he is there.

283
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,295
That will be unnecessary.

284
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:03,613
The Queen is here!

285
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,403
Bow before her!

286
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:14,130
Mother.

287
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,627
The Assistant Gwanju
told me what happened.

288
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,757
I was shocked, so I came here myself.

289
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:26,344
Is it true that a soul shifter
was found here?

290
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:29,264
The eunuch who served you
was a soul shifter.

291
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:32,054
He ran wild and got petrified
here at Cheonbugwan.

292
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:36,143
- Is that so?
- That is not true.

293
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,982
No soul shifter ran wild here.

294
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,402
It is simply a lie

295
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:43,236
that Jang Uk is making up.

296
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:48,076
Let us see if it is a lie or not
after we search for the eunuch's body.

297
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:54,742
Who is this soul shifter eunuch
that he claims to have seen?

298
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,123
Eunuch Kim.

299
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:08,097
Eunuch Kim came here with me.

300
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,646
Eunuch Kim, come inside.

301
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,346
Is he the eunuch

302
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:56,353
that you claim to have seen

303
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,606
run wild?

304
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,272
Yes.

305
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:03,983
You said he got petrified.

306
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:06,523
But he is well and alive.

307
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,197
You are right.

308
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:14,742
He is completely fine.

309
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,581
The only way to get out of this situationâ€¦

310
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:31,132
Is to bring this thing back to life.

311
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,908
He is fine even after he ran wild.

312
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,948
If that is the power of the ice stone,

313
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:54,618
it means I can save Mu-deok
even if she ever runs wild.

314
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,536
Mu-deok.

315
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:59,710
We must have been mistaken.

316
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:02,912
I guess so, Young Master.

317
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,630
You were not mistaken. You blatantly lied.

318
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:09,930
He is standing there completely fine,

319
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,961
so I guess that means I was lying.

320
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:19,267
He tried to lie his way out

321
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,562
because he got scared that
he broke the constellation basin.

322
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:23,982
Uk.

323
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:27,108
Is that true?

324
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:32,366
Yes, it is true.
Everything I said was a lie.

325
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:38,286
You entered Cheonbugwan without permission
and broke a valuable possession.

326
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:42,206
Then you made up a lie
to get yourself out of the situation?

327
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:45,126
I apologize. I am sorry.

328
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:49,463
This was done by a mage of Songrim,

329
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:52,503
so allow me to apologize on his behalf.

330
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:57,140
I would also like to apologize
to Assistant Gwanju Jin Mu.

331
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:05,940
Songrim will fix
the broken constellation basin.

332
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:09,400
That is unnecessary.

333
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:10,693
Do not refuse.

334
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:13,363
It is only right that
we take full responsibility.

335
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,534
- No.
- Your Highness.

336
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,788
Please give Songrim a chance
to make up for our mistake.

337
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,621
You should let them do that, Mother.

338
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:27,548
You may do as you wish.

339
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:30,751
I shall head back now.

340
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:56,405
I will send our people to Cheonbugwan
starting from tomorrow

341
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:58,495
and have them fix what has been damaged.

342
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:02,411
As for now,
I should head back to punish our mage

343
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:05,831
for having deceived the royal family
and the people of Cheonbugwan.

344
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,336
- Let us go.
- Nonsense.

345
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:12,334
Jang Uk will stay and get punished here.

346
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,385
I also think that isâ€¦

347
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:22,229
My goodness, Your Royal Highness.

348
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,727
Please help my young master.

349
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:27,522
Do not let him get taken to Songrim.

350
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:33,941
If he gets taken there,
he might get flogged to death.

351
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,697
Last time,

352
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:40,037
he got flogged 100 times in Songrim.

353
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:42,702
This time, it will only be worse.

354
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:45,032
Please do not let that happen.

355
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,241
Mu-deok, that is enough.

356
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:53,372
What I did was wrong.
It is only right for me to get punished.

357
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:59,179
I failed to show courtesy
to His Royal Highness.

358
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:03,431
I have no right to ask for mercy.

359
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:07,471
Then are you going to let them
drag you away and kill you?

360
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:10,397
If that is what the leader wants,
then yes.

361
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:14,275
Oh, goodness.

362
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,534
You can take me.

363
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,578
My goodness, Young Master!

364
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:27,418
But you will die!

365
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:32,090
Goodness, you will die if you go back!

366
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:39,173
I will punish him adequately.

367
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:45,059
Hey. You there.

368
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:51,520
Uk will be punished severely.

369
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:53,360
So just forget about what happened.

370
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,816
How ridiculous.

371
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,066
But then again,

372
00:28:57,485 --> 00:29:00,111
the honey biscuit story
was absurd to begin with.

373
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:03,324
The leader of Songrim
and Assistant Gwanju of Cheonbugwan

374
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,154
fighting over honey biscuits?

375
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,130
Goodness.

376
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,282
What an outrageous excuse.

377
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,125
Right.

378
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,298
But how did the constellation basin break?

379
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:21,092
If it got struck by lightning,

380
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,636
it means the ceiling
above the constellation basin was open.

381
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,056
But I thought only those
who have reached Chisu could open it.

382
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,268
That is correct.

383
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,816
Jang Uk could not have reached Chisu.

384
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:41,151
I wonder how this broke.

385
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:51,089
Was there another mage here
who had reached Chisu?

386
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:53,492
But that would be impossible.

387
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:13,144
We were able to get out of there
thanks to you, Mu-deok.

388
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,020
If you try to hold on, people let go.

389
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:17,273
If you let go, people try to hold on.

390
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:21,152
So you caused a fuss on purpose?
That was clever of you.

391
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:24,155
I did not think
they would be convinced by you,

392
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:26,449
so I got involved without any permission.

393
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:28,709
I am sorry to have flustered you.

394
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:32,626
I did not expect that,
so it is true that I was flustered.

395
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:35,795
But you did well.

396
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,544
My lord.

397
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:40,588
We were not lying.

398
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:44,341
We clearly saw Eunuch Kim run wild
and get petrified.

399
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:45,841
I know you were not lying.

400
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:48,721
I may be slow-witted at times,

401
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,801
but I can tell lies from the truth.

402
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,392
A petrified soul shifter
came back to life.

403
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:57,232
Does that mean they have the ice stone?

404
00:30:57,897 --> 00:30:59,693
Songrim has been

405
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,401
keeping our eyes on Jin Mu.

406
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,571
It is just as expected.

407
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,826
I guess they really do have the ice stone.

408
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:19,585
Did you insert the ice stone
inside my body?

409
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:22,135
Its power is truly astounding.

410
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:25,552
It really feels like I am still alive.

411
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:30,265
Was it Jang Uk who caused you
to become petrified?

412
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:34,221
Just as I was about to suck out
his servant's energy,

413
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:38,813
my energy suddenly started
to leave my body,

414
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,102
and I lost consciousness.

415
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:45,776
Did you also not see Jang Uk open
the ceiling above the constellation basin?

416
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:47,698
No, I did not.

417
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:51,499
Was there another mage there
other than Jang Uk?

418
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:53,703
No, there was not.

419
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,042
What if Jang Uk has reached Chisu already?

420
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:59,081
Maybe he is just hiding it.

421
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:04,296
When he tried to attack me,
he did not seem that skilled.

422
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:07,636
He mastered Ryusu
in an extremely short amount of time.

423
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,809
So it is possible.

424
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,682
Now that I have the ice stone,

425
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:18,102
does that mean I am capable of Hwansu?

426
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,526
You do possess the power of it.

427
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:27,319
However, you do not know
how to practice spells.

428
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:30,409
Therefore, you are unable to use it.

429
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,789
But this ice stone is mine now.

430
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:41,959
I only brought you back to life
momentarily because it was urgent.

431
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:37,765
So the ice stone
really does have the ability

432
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,475
to stop a soul shifter
from getting petrified.

433
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,976
We must find it and destroy it.

434
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:47,274
We should be getting rid of soul shifters,
but it brings them back to life.

435
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,314
Its power is truly evil.

436
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,028
But that isâ€¦

437
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:57,242
Uk, word will get out
about your punishment,

438
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:59,282
so you should not be in Songrim.

439
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,246
Stay at home for a while.

440
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:05,167
Yes, my lord.
Mu-deok and I will head home.

441
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:09,717
Be careful not to cross paths with Jin Mu.

442
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,966
I will.

443
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,131
Let us go.

444
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,396
He will get rid of the ice stone
as soon as he finds it.

445
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,398
We need to find it before he does.

446
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:29,198
Gil-ju was right.

447
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:32,612
The ice stone is inside the palace.

448
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:36,325
Then the Danju who possesses the ice stone

449
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,574
must be that person.

450
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:45,124
Take care of everything quietly.

451
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:47,793
I will have Court Lady Han take his place.

452
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:50,213
You may relay your messages through her.

453
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,041
Yes, Your Highness.

454
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:56,928
Because of what happened today,
Songrim will start suspecting me.

455
00:34:57,386 --> 00:35:02,142
This all happened
because you underestimated Jang Uk.

456
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,436
I had no idea
he would break free so easily.

457
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,771
He is a genius
who instantly reached Ryusu.

458
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:10,024
He was born with the energy
of the King's Star.

459
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,914
I did not underestimate him
from the start.

460
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,319
I also figured he might be special

461
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:17,197
because he was born
with the energy of the King's star.

462
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:20,534
However, Jang Uk turned out to be
a complete disappointment.

463
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:23,454
He was just an average boy
with nothing special about him.

464
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:30,085
He was angry at the world,
and he hid his helplessness and indolence

465
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:34,425
by putting on a cold-hearted mask.
He never did anything with a goal.

466
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:37,468
He was just a young master
who was full of himself,

467
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:40,383
so all one ever had to do was appease him.

468
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:43,268
That means he has changed.

469
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:45,851
I thought he was weak.

470
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:48,729
But he opened his gate of energy
by consuming poison.

471
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:52,279
I thought he liked to show off,
but he actually beat the Crown Prince.

472
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:55,277
Why do you think
he changed all of a sudden?

473
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:57,327
People changeâ€¦

474
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,284
Because of other people.

475
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:04,326
Find out who showed up
just when he began to change.

476
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:08,544
That will be your answer.

477
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:15,961
Jang Uk was rejected by 12 masters,
but has finally found his wayâ€¦

478
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:21,264
Who could have helped him do that?

479
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:27,607
Master, should we go straight
to Danhyanggok?

480
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:31,567
Thanks to my punishment,
we have some time.

481
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,774
Let us train at Danhyanggok.

482
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:36,774
We can also try climbing up that tree.

483
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:42,867
It is freezing right now at Danhyanggok.

484
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:46,245
If we get stuck there due to the snow,

485
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:48,580
we could starve to death.

486
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:51,667
I thought it was warm during the winter
and had a lot to eat.

487
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:54,217
I heard you say that to Yul last time.

488
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:01,463
I only said that to put him at ease.

489
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:09,226
He was worried that his pet bird
might have suffered during the winter,

490
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,856
so I told him that.

491
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:16,068
You mean the bird he always called
using his whistle at Danhyanggok?

492
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:41,093
Uk was almost killed by Jin Mu.

493
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:46,388
I apologized for what Uk did
and got him out of there.

494
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:49,358
But Jin Mu might try to harm Uk.

495
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:55,606
Fortunately, I insisted on
fixing the constellation basin,

496
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,526
so we have access to Cheonbugwan.

497
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:03,155
I want you to go to Cheonbugwan
along with Songrim's laborers

498
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:05,495
and keep an eye on Jin Mu.

499
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:08,208
- Yes, my lord.
- Yes, my lord.

500
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,796
Sang-ho.

501
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:22,341
I heard Mu-deok was
also at Cheonbugwan today.

502
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:24,092
Is she all right?

503
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:25,592
She is fine.

504
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:32,643
By the way, did the soul shifter
who ran wild and got petrified

505
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,561
really come back to life?

506
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:38,231
That is why the leader had to leave
without being able to say anything.

507
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:42,525
How did Uk react to that?

508
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,983
He actually did not seem too flustered.

509
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:48,200
He kept asking the leader
if the soul shifter who ran wild

510
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,911
was able to come back to life
thanks to the ice stone.

511
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,161
He already seemed to know
about the ice stone.

512
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:58,543
So he saw a soul shifter come back to life
with his own two eyes.

513
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:01,213
The leader told him
that they must be destroyed.

514
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:04,258
Both the soul shifters and ice stones.

515
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,638
He said we must
get rid of all things that are evil.

516
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,807
What did Uk say to that?

517
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,937
This is just my hunch,

518
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,435
but he seemed to disagree.

519
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:20,399
Uk is always carefree and easygoing.

520
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:24,579
However, he should not keep that attitude
toward sorcery as well.

521
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,489
You and Uk are close.

522
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:29,709
So you should warn him about it.

523
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:44,256
Not only is Danhyanggok cold,

524
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,806
but it would also mean
we would have to be alone.

525
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:50,017
We should refrain from doing that
from now on.

526
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,347
Why all of a sudden?

527
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:56,261
I am scared thatâ€¦

528
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,437
I might devour your energy.

529
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:04,151
You did not run wild.
Nothing happened even after we touched.

530
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,691
I clearly absorbed
the energy of that eunuch.

531
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:08,572
I may seem fine now,

532
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:11,242
but we never know
when that might happen again.

533
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,538
Feel free to run away,

534
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:17,090
or kill me if you must.

535
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,463
But if I devour your energy until you dieâ€¦

536
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:25,172
That will be unbearable.

537
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,434
Why are you laughing?

538
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,601
Is this funny to you?

539
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,725
No, it is not that.

540
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:43,851
You made my heart race.

541
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,026
What you just saidâ€¦

542
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:51,692
Holds a deeper meaning
than saying, "I missed you."

543
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:57,124
The cruel assassin has finally replied

544
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:01,086
to my naive and sincere love confession.

545
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:12,172
I will find the ice stone

546
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:16,147
so that you will never feel the need
to devour my energy.

547
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:25,190
You will have to go against Park Jin.

548
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:28,240
Then I will become just as strong.

549
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:35,616
You lost nine duels in a row
to the mages of Jeongjingak.

550
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:38,241
Stop putting on airs.

551
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:45,081
Right, the yin-and-yang jade.
I should get that back first.

552
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:49,844
But how did you call the Crown Prince
through the yin-and-yang jade?

553
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:53,928
There is a way to do that. It reallyâ€¦

554
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:56,723
It really makes your heart race.

555
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:19,538
Jang Uk, the so-called intruder,
had no sword.

556
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:23,957
But Jin Mu had one
although he claimed to be innocent.

557
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,138
Young Master.

558
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:41,099
Master Lee, what are you doing
at our house?

559
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:43,359
What about you?
Should you not be at Songrim?

560
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:46,184
He is here on probation.

561
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:50,318
"Probation"? Did you get punished?

562
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,777
What did you do this time?

563
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:54,237
No, that is not it.

564
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:57,157
Maidservant Kim, do not get too shocked.

565
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,707
This is sort of likeâ€¦

566
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,995
Fake probation.

567
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,335
It is more like a vacation
disguised as probation.

568
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:09,968
He is right.

569
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:12,504
That is good to hear.

570
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:16,928
Let us fish at Lake Gyeongcheondaeho
starting from tomorrow.

571
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:19,513
Good idea.

572
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:23,934
You should enjoy your time here
by spending time with Young Master Jang.

573
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:24,976
Gosh.

574
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:28,647
No, Maidservant Kim.
I am in no position to slack around.

575
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:30,106
Master Lee, I apologize.

576
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:32,734
I have already lost nine out of ten duels.

577
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:34,734
I only have one more duel left.

578
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:38,155
I plan to use this time to train.
I hope you understand.

579
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:42,410
You have become very diligent
all of a sudden.

580
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:45,664
Yes, my goal is
to make Maidservant Kim proud.

581
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:47,834
I cannot slack around and go fishing.

582
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:52,965
These days, you touch me
with your words every single day.

583
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:54,589
All right.

584
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:56,132
Go ahead and train.

585
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:59,172
Meanwhile, I will cook
a delicious late-night snack.

586
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:11,107
Tell me the truth.
Why are you on probation?

587
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:17,403
I went to Cheonbugwan
and broke the constellation basin.

588
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:20,198
Please do not tell Maidservant Kim.

589
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:23,243
I did see the lightning strike
from the skies right above Cheonbugwan.

590
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,093
I guess that hit the constellation basin.

591
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:29,509
We cannot tell you anything in detail,
but it was not Young Master Jang's fault.

592
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:33,462
The leader of Songrim
will tell you what happened.

593
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:36,548
I will lend you my fishing rods.

594
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:38,466
Back when I used to enjoy fishing,

595
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:41,136
I collected several
high-quality fishing rods.

596
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,346
I will bring them.

597
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:48,770
What a pity.

598
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:54,240
I was going to teach him
how to catch a Golden Fish.

599
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:56,233
A Golden Fish?

600
00:44:56,693 --> 00:45:00,196
You mean the legendary golden fish
that can only be found

601
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,996
in Lake Gyeongcheondaeho?

602
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:03,825
Do you know what it is?

603
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:07,120
I have heard of it.
A fish that grows with the lake's energy.

604
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:11,416
I heard it can only be caught
by mages who have mastered Chisu or above.

605
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,796
You really are knowledgeable.

606
00:45:14,042 --> 00:45:16,296
That feeling of catching a Golden Fish
as you control

607
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,136
the energy of Lake Gyeongcheondaehoâ€¦

608
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,886
It is ecstatic.

609
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:25,764
Please teach Young Master Jang
what that feels like.

610
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:26,974
He said he is busy.

611
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,225
Master Lee.

612
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:31,186
Master Lee, look at this.

613
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:33,355
This is the best one.
It was made with bamboo...

614
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:35,982
He is not busy. Starting tomorrow,

615
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:39,062
Young Master Jang
will go fishing with you.

616
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:42,489
What do you mean? I need to train.

617
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:45,999
Right now, you need to fish,
not practice with a sword.

618
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:50,377
Go to Lake Gyeongcheondaeho
and catch a Golden Fish.

619
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:52,210
What?

620
00:46:04,636 --> 00:46:06,222
This looks like a nice spot.

621
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:08,268
No, Master Lee.

622
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:12,519
I have fished here before.
The water is too cold here.

623
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:15,489
Fish do not swim here
because there are no lake weeds.

624
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:18,900
On top of that, we did not even bring
any of the nice fishing rods.

625
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:22,530
When catching a Golden Fish,
you must use a rod that bends easily.

626
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:25,111
Just like this one.

627
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:28,994
Is this bait for the Golden Fish?

628
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:30,620
They are snacks.

629
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:34,250
Maidservant Kim packed some snacks
for Master Lee.

630
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:37,879
Maidservant Kim is a very kind woman.

631
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:40,255
Where is the bait?

632
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:42,424
We need worms or mudfish as bait.

633
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:44,054
What? My goodness.

634
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,679
Do you fish with no bait?

635
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:51,189
I told you already.
Golden Fish feed off of energy.

636
00:46:51,808 --> 00:46:54,604
My energy will
flow along this bamboo stick,

637
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:57,149
and that will act as bait.

638
00:46:58,607 --> 00:46:59,733
Your energy?

639
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:03,908
Young Master Jang, go ahead
and follow what he is doing.

640
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:05,489
Go on.

641
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:16,374
Now we just need to control
the energy of Lake Gyeongcheondaeho

642
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:18,794
and wait until a Golden Fish bites.

643
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:27,382
Mu-deok.

644
00:47:27,844 --> 00:47:31,060
I feel like a fool doing this.
Must I continue?

645
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:39,690
It bit!

646
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:52,495
That is what you call a Golden Fish.

647
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:56,792
It is a mass of water that is formed
with the energy of Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.

648
00:47:57,332 --> 00:48:00,585
Only masters of Chisu and above
who have the ability to control water

649
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:02,465
are able to catch it.

650
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:06,466
I have not fished in a long time.

651
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:09,976
But I must say, it still feels great
to catch a Golden Fish.

652
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:14,805
So it is not an actual fish?

653
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:17,683
Master Lee did not bring you here to fish.

654
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:21,446
He is here to teach you
how to master Chisu.

655
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:23,566
Only those who are able

656
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:26,656
to fish out the mass of energy
from Lake Gyeongcheondaeho

657
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:29,489
can master Chisu.

658
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:32,574
"Chisu"?

659
00:48:40,917 --> 00:48:42,998
Slowly.

660
00:48:43,177 --> 00:48:44,256
All right.

661
00:48:44,341 --> 00:48:47,390
No, you are too hasty. Slow and steady.

662
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:49,592
- Slowly.
- No.

663
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:04,732
Cheonbugwan must have found
another blind lady.

664
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:07,235
Young Lady Jin says
they bring in several blind ladies

665
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:09,325
from all over the country every day.

666
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:13,788
- Let us go.
- All right.

667
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:28,131
So are you saying

668
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:31,092
there could be a soul shifter
hidden inside every family

669
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:33,219
that took part in murdering Naksu's father

670
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:35,439
and that we should use Jinyowon's relics

671
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:37,515
to find them?

672
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:39,809
We were going to wait
until the soul shifter

673
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:42,312
that ran wild at Daegangtongun
regained consciousness,

674
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:44,188
but we cannot do nothing until then.

675
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:45,818
The truth is,

676
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:48,904
last night, we found another soul shifter.

677
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:51,362
Yes, I heard.

678
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:55,033
The soul shifter of a eunuch
was found in Cheonbugwan.

679
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:58,533
Jin Mu must have already paid you a visit.

680
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:04,007
My brother, Jin Mu, told me that
Songrim sent an intruder to Cheonbugwan

681
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:07,754
and tried to frame him. He was very upset.

682
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:11,094
If we want to find out if he is innocent
or is actually using sorcery,

683
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:15,678
we need the relics of Jinyowon
and the power of its leader.

684
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:17,228
Please help me.

685
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:20,056
I am sorry,

686
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:22,931
but I refuse.

687
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:28,699
It is extremely disgraceful for a mage
to be accused of sorcery.

688
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:30,860
If we go around

689
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:35,330
investigating mages with our relics
without any kind of clear evidence,

690
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:38,910
it will anger many people
and cause them to resent Jinyowon.

691
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:40,460
I heard Jin Mu

692
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:44,050
has been in search
of your eldest daughter.

693
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:48,299
Did he ask you
not to cooperate with Songrim

694
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:51,046
in return for helping you
find your daughter?

695
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:53,383
- That is irrelevant.
- No, it is not.

696
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:57,970
Your recent attitude toward Songrim
has suddenly changed.

697
00:50:58,054 --> 00:51:01,516
Do you always expect me
to do what you tell me to do?

698
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,106
Is that the attitude you want?

699
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:08,314
We, the people of Jinyowon,
do not take orders

700
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:09,899
from Songrim.

701
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:11,949
- Lady Jin...
- Please leave.

702
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:15,618
There is someone I must meet.

703
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:29,252
Once they find your older sister,

704
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:32,755
there will no longer be
any obstacles to our love.

705
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:36,305
That is because Songrim and Jinyowon
have a close relationship.

706
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,136
Oh, andâ€¦

707
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:41,843
Here.

708
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:45,931
This is the ornament
that I said was pretty last time.

709
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:48,771
I thought someone had already bought it.

710
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:50,440
How did you get it?

711
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:53,609
I paid that person
four times its original price.

712
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:55,403
I thought you might like it.

713
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:57,693
I am extremely happy.

714
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:01,242
The fact that you are happy

715
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:05,162
makes me the happiest man in the world.

716
00:52:16,132 --> 00:52:18,050
Why does Uncle look so upset?

717
00:52:18,134 --> 00:52:19,600
Did something happen?

718
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:23,268
I think he had a big argument
with the leader of Jinyowon.

719
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:45,457
I drew a dark red mole
behind her left ear.

720
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:51,203
Bu-yeon fell as a child,
which left a scar on her left arm.

721
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:56,173
Its length was
about one-third of a finger.

722
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:31,709
You must go through this
to become Jin Bu-yeon, so endure it.

723
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:34,502
We will engrave every little mole, scar,

724
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:37,882
and any other detail that
a mother would remember.

725
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:40,758
Yes.

726
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:44,518
I will pour acid on your skin
so that the scar will become more clear.

727
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:31,517
What kind of fish is Young Master Jang
trying to catch?

728
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:33,477
All he does is go to that lake.

729
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:36,480
I should go and bring them their food.

730
00:54:36,564 --> 00:54:38,566
I will ask Mr. Lee to do that.

731
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:40,906
I want you to stay
and help me with something.

732
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:46,658
We need to clean the house
and cook for a memorial service.

733
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:49,285
Whose memorial service?

734
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:51,705
A young girl who died a pitiful death.

735
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,332
She had an ill-fated relationship
with our family,

736
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:56,542
so I wish to hold
a memorial service for her.

737
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:59,295
Maidservant Kim.

738
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:00,880
I am back from the temple.

739
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:02,131
- All right.
- Here.

740
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:04,671
The Buddhist monk wrote an oration.

741
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:07,721
Goodness, this is great.

742
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,306
But where are their names?

743
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:12,558
He should have written the names
of the spirits.

744
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:13,935
Goodness.

745
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:16,935
It is right there.
"Cho Chung and Cho Yeong."

746
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:20,484
Cho Yeong? That is my name.

747
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:22,944
Oh, yes. I see it now.

748
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:24,694
"Cho Chung and Cho Yeong."

749
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,323
What a nice oration.

750
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:29,903
Mr. Lee, come with me.

751
00:55:30,059 --> 00:55:32,034
I need you to deliver food
to Young Master Jang.

752
00:55:32,128 --> 00:55:33,374
All right.

753
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:36,838
Is Maidservant Kim
holding a memorial service

754
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:39,758
for me and my father?

755
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:20,543
It is mushroom rice, my favorite.

756
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:24,003
Maidservant Kim is such a great cook.

757
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:32,632
It bit! I got one!

758
00:56:43,024 --> 00:56:45,620
I put a worm on the hook earlier.
That is what it bit.

759
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:48,369
We can have it as a side dish.

760
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:55,281
My gosh.

761
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:14,138
Here.

762
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:21,772
Do not rush yourself.

763
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:25,816
One day, you will feel
the same feeling that you feel

764
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:28,277
when a fish bites into a hook.

765
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:32,077
That is what you call Chisu,
the ability to control energy.

766
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:34,784
I see.

767
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:38,839
Master Lee, you even taught me
how to read Words of the Heart.

768
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:41,840
May I ask why you keep trying to help me?

769
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:45,965
By any chance, is it because of a reason

770
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:49,503
that must be kept a secret?

771
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:52,760
It is not your concern.

772
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:54,640
Did you think I would not know?

773
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:58,642
It is regarding my family.

774
00:58:03,521 --> 00:58:05,237
It is because of Maidservant Kim?

775
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:10,319
I mean, you compliment her nonstop.

776
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:12,738
And that scarf you are wearing.

777
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:15,248
That is from the shop
that Maidservant Kim goes to.

778
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:17,495
She gave it to you, right?

779
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:19,620
And most importantly,

780
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:23,416
I saw the dried wildflowers
in Maidservant Kim's room.

781
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,751
There were a lot of them at Danhyanggok.

782
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:27,501
You gave them to her, did you not?

783
00:58:28,963 --> 00:58:31,719
- Yes, I did.
- Gosh, I knew it.

784
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:34,969
But I thought you practiced chastityâ€¦

785
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:38,439
My feelings for her are not worldly.

786
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:41,517
I just think she is beautiful
and warm-hearted.

787
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:43,147
That is all there is to it.

788
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:46,605
That is the same thing
as saying you like her.

789
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:48,935
How can love between
a man and a woman not be worldly?

790
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:50,443
What about you?

791
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:54,036
You are a man and Mu-deok is a woman.
What does that make you two?

792
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:57,613
Well, as for meâ€¦

793
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:00,414
I do like her.

794
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:08,711
I cannot believe I am talking about this
with a man who practices chastity.

795
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:12,256
Anyway, Maidservant Kim
has feelings for someone else.

796
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:13,716
I hope you do not get hurt.

797
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,516
I should be saying that to you.

798
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,765
I heard Mu-deok likes Yul.

799
00:59:18,850 --> 00:59:21,610
Did Dang-go tell you that?
What kind of worldly conversation is that?

800
00:59:21,695 --> 00:59:23,645
I do not just spend time with you.

801
00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:27,431
I learned that worldly conversations

802
00:59:28,147 --> 00:59:30,143
can sometimes be of help.

803
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:34,236
Thanks to Yul's story
about his first love,

804
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:37,366
I was able to learn about Naksu,
the assassin.

805
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:43,379
The girl he met at Danhyanggok
when he was young

806
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:45,836
turned out to be Naksu.

807
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:48,292
He knew it was her

808
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:51,212
when he saw the whistle he gave her
on Naksu's dead body.

809
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:57,464
I know you overheard my conversation
with Jin at Sejukwon.

810
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:02,842
Then I am guessing
you also know about Naksu's story.

811
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:08,525
You should go home early today.

812
01:00:09,355 --> 01:00:11,061
Maidservant Kim is going to hold

813
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:15,239
a memorial service for the little girl
who died a pitiful death.

814
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:33,082
This is good enough.

815
01:00:33,546 --> 01:00:34,880
The constellation basin is fixed.

816
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:37,925
So take all your laborers back to Songrim.

817
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:41,136
No, it is not perfect yet.

818
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:42,680
We think it is good enough.

819
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:44,014
What is with you?

820
01:00:44,098 --> 01:00:45,474
Goodness, look at that.

821
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:49,474
The lower part of the basin
is a different color from the top.

822
01:00:49,937 --> 01:00:51,981
We should exchange the lower part.

823
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:54,231
You have exchanged it many times already.

824
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:55,943
We think it is fine.

825
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:57,444
The leader of Songrim promised

826
01:00:57,528 --> 01:01:00,534
to return the constellation basin
to its original form.

827
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:02,906
We cannot let a single mistake slide.

828
01:01:04,285 --> 01:01:06,991
The construction normally takes
a day or two at most.

829
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:09,206
But it is taking quite a long time.

830
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:11,667
Do you feel uneasy
that we keep coming here?

831
01:01:11,751 --> 01:01:13,669
What is there to feel uneasy about?

832
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:18,509
I just think Songrim is
wasting its time and money.

833
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:25,556
Do not worry about money
when it comes to Songrim.

834
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:30,394
Yul, the last time I saw you,
you seemed quite skilled.

835
01:01:30,478 --> 01:01:32,274
Have you mastered Chisu?

836
01:01:33,981 --> 01:01:35,197
Yes.

837
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:38,402
Then you must be
the first mage in Jeongjingak

838
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:40,782
to have mastered Chisu.

839
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:44,456
Like father like son.
Your father, Seo Il, must be proud.

840
01:01:45,326 --> 01:01:47,202
He was a Jeongjingak mage?

841
01:01:48,746 --> 01:01:50,912
You cannot drag her against her will.

842
01:01:56,254 --> 01:01:58,050
Can you stand?

843
01:02:00,174 --> 01:02:01,430
What are you looking at?

844
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:06,639
Is he a Jeongjingak mage?

845
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:09,183
- Is his name Seo Yul?
- Yes.

846
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:12,063
They are sons of prestigious families
and are out of your league.

847
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,566
Do not roam around and stay hidden.

848
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:23,909
He may be out of my league
when I am So-i, a swindling vagabond.

849
01:02:27,034 --> 01:02:30,080
But once I become Jin Bu-yeon,
the future leader of Jinyowon,

850
01:02:31,622 --> 01:02:33,298
I might have a chance.

851
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:44,770
It is for Master Jang's friend
and that friend's daughter.

852
01:02:46,971 --> 01:02:48,847
There are no graves for them,

853
01:02:49,724 --> 01:02:52,360
and I bet no one has held
a memorial service for them.

854
01:02:52,977 --> 01:02:54,933
So I figured I should at least hold one.

855
01:02:56,731 --> 01:02:57,987
Maidservant Kim.

856
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:02,111
Thank you.

857
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:04,445
What?

858
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:08,035
That is what they would say.

859
01:03:08,993 --> 01:03:11,539
I bet they are extremely grateful.

860
01:03:13,122 --> 01:03:14,918
It relieves me to hear that.

861
01:03:16,417 --> 01:03:18,873
Leave the incense sticks
until they burn out.

862
01:03:46,697 --> 01:03:49,033
CHO CHUNG, CHO YEONG

863
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:09,594
CHO CHUNG, CHO YEONG

864
01:04:17,603 --> 01:04:18,939
Fatherâ€¦

865
01:04:31,158 --> 01:04:33,285
Young Master Jang went fishing.

866
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:36,205
He will be back soon,
so you can wait for him inside.

867
01:04:37,582 --> 01:04:39,416
Did Mu-deok also go with him?

868
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:41,710
Mu-deok is at home.

869
01:04:41,794 --> 01:04:43,600
She had to prepare for a memorial service.

870
01:04:57,810 --> 01:05:00,356
CHO CHUNG, CHO YEONG

871
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:04,271
If I had not left you there

872
01:05:05,484 --> 01:05:07,200
in the mountains,

873
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:15,163
you would not have to suffer this fate
where you have to hold your tears

874
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:18,376
and pretend to be someone else.

875
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:25,292
But even now,

876
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:29,759
I cannot seem to step up

877
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:32,769
and tell you that
I know who you really are.

878
01:05:45,691 --> 01:05:47,447
CHO CHUNG, CHO YEONG

879
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:54,933
The incense sticks have burned out.

880
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:57,451
Yes.

881
01:05:57,995 --> 01:05:59,161
They have.

882
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:00,748
Were you here all along?

883
01:06:04,043 --> 01:06:05,509
Let us clean up.

884
01:06:45,292 --> 01:06:48,211
When did you come back?
I heard you went fishing.

885
01:06:48,295 --> 01:06:50,339
Yes, I just got back.

886
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:51,757
Are you here alone? Where is Dang-go?

887
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:54,593
He is busy for some reason.
I think he is meeting someone.

888
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:56,053
I see.

889
01:06:57,179 --> 01:06:58,430
What brings you here?

890
01:06:58,514 --> 01:07:01,650
The leader ended your probation
and asked you to come back to Songrim.

891
01:07:02,101 --> 01:07:04,647
That was faster than expected.

892
01:07:05,479 --> 01:07:08,690
Have a seat. Let us enjoy some drinks.
I need to talk to you anyway.

893
01:07:08,774 --> 01:07:10,530
Unfortunately, I cannot drink.

894
01:07:11,152 --> 01:07:13,695
- I have to go back to Songrim.
- All right.

895
01:07:13,779 --> 01:07:17,035
Then I will tell you what I wanted to say
tomorrow at Jeongjingak.

896
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:19,286
You will be surprised.

897
01:07:20,828 --> 01:07:24,544
Uk, I will be returning
to Seoho Fortress soon.

898
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:28,043
I promised my father that

899
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:30,833
I would only train at Jeongjingak
until I mastered Chisu.

900
01:07:31,422 --> 01:07:33,882
Master Heo wrote my father a letter,

901
01:07:33,966 --> 01:07:35,962
so he might order me to return soon.

902
01:07:36,427 --> 01:07:37,511
Then I will have to go.

903
01:07:37,595 --> 01:07:39,301
But that place is too far away.

904
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:43,102
Dang-go and I are
going to miss you so much.

905
01:07:44,643 --> 01:07:46,439
When I return to Seoho Fortress,

906
01:07:48,022 --> 01:07:49,988
there is someone I wish to take with me.

907
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:54,654
- Who?
- I cannot tell you now.

908
01:07:56,655 --> 01:07:58,061
I will tell you once it is time.

909
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:01,995
I will be off now. See you tomorrow.

910
01:08:02,995 --> 01:08:04,201
All right. Bye.

911
01:08:38,364 --> 01:08:39,781
Because I missed them.

912
01:08:39,865 --> 01:08:42,071
I liked them a lot.

913
01:08:45,746 --> 01:08:48,749
They can prevent that
by feeding on others' energy.

914
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:50,259
But once they do that,

915
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:53,056
they will no longer be humans,
but monsters.

916
01:08:54,004 --> 01:08:56,050
And it is our duty to protect this worldâ€¦

917
01:08:56,882 --> 01:08:58,348
From such monsters.

918
01:09:01,262 --> 01:09:04,558
I wonder if Yul knows everything.

919
01:09:05,724 --> 01:09:07,690
When I return to Seoho Fortress,

920
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:10,150
there is someone I wish to take with me.

921
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:17,903
Young Master.

922
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:19,233
Yes?

923
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:25,164
Is Seo Yul gone?
Maidservant Kim sent this for him.

924
01:09:32,334 --> 01:09:33,970
I guess he was talking about you.

925
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:37,798
What do you mean?
Did Seo Yul say something?

926
01:09:41,218 --> 01:09:42,984
I was told to return to Songrim tomorrow.

927
01:09:43,721 --> 01:09:45,187
Is that why you look upset?

928
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:48,054
Cha Beom will ask you

929
01:09:48,475 --> 01:09:50,936
to fight him for your last duel
as soon as you return.

930
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:52,546
You must be afraid of losing again.

931
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:54,648
I will not lose tomorrow.

932
01:09:57,276 --> 01:09:58,612
I finally caught it.

933
01:10:17,838 --> 01:10:20,134
Today is Jang Uk's last duel.

934
01:10:23,177 --> 01:10:25,428
I have talked to the person
who I have made this bet with,

935
01:10:25,512 --> 01:10:27,388
and the prize for today's winner

936
01:10:28,098 --> 01:10:30,514
will not be a gold toad.
It will be something else.

937
01:10:44,823 --> 01:10:46,499
The winner of today's duel

938
01:10:47,785 --> 01:10:49,201
will be winning that maid.

939
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:57,213
I have agreed to serveâ€¦

940
01:10:59,004 --> 01:11:01,350
The winner of today's duel as my master.

941
01:11:10,849 --> 01:11:13,145
- What is going on?
- All right, then.

942
01:11:13,686 --> 01:11:15,612
The person fighting Jang Uk
for his last duel.

943
01:11:16,063 --> 01:11:17,189
Step forward.

944
01:11:45,467 --> 01:11:46,593
Uk.

945
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:50,230
The person you will be fighting against

946
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:52,723
is me.

947
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:51,992
Uk is someone who can potentially
bring chaos to the world.

948
01:12:52,076 --> 01:12:54,286
What if he becomes the center
of the world's attention?

949
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:56,204
I only need those
who will definitely win the duel.

950
01:12:56,288 --> 01:12:58,790
Then I will beat Uk
and take her in as my maid.

951
01:12:58,874 --> 01:13:02,640
Did he master all of his opponents' spells
from his previous nine duels?

952
01:13:02,725 --> 01:13:03,795
I must find it.

953
01:13:03,879 --> 01:13:05,094
You must lose something as well.

954
01:13:05,179 --> 01:13:07,090
Your heartwrenching love
will be thrown away.

955
01:13:07,174 --> 01:13:10,010
Only then can I see him without shame.

956
01:13:10,094 --> 01:13:13,847
