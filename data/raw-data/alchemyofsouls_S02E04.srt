2
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,376
You and I…

3
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:52,738
Have liked each other for a long time.

4
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:53,970
What?

5
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:59,879
I remember when we exchanged
this yin-and-yang jade.

6
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:02,590
You remember what?

7
00:01:02,675 --> 00:01:04,847
Last time, you made up
a nonexistent witness.

8
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:07,715
Are you making up memories now?

9
00:01:11,018 --> 00:01:12,144
"They are bird's eggs."

10
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,894
"I will choose first."

11
00:01:17,105 --> 00:01:19,340
"I pick red. You can have the blue one."

12
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:22,999
I will choose first.

13
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,959
I pick red. You can have the blue one.

14
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,047
See?

15
00:01:30,311 --> 00:01:32,147
I am not lying this time.

16
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:38,815
How did you know that?

17
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:42,351
It came to me as soon as I held this jade.

18
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,754
Why you?

19
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:46,272
Maybe…

20
00:01:47,278 --> 00:01:49,944
Because I am a priestess
with great divine powers.

21
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,824
There is no way that memory is mine.

22
00:01:57,058 --> 00:01:59,084
It probably belongs
to the owner of this blue jade.

23
00:02:01,936 --> 00:02:03,402
This yin-and-yang jade

24
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,042
is from Jinyowon, is it not?

25
00:02:08,387 --> 00:02:10,223
I must have seen it there
when I was young.

26
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:13,553
I got these flashbacks when I saw it,
so I thought they were my memories.

27
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,336
But it turns out they were the owner's.

28
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:20,104
Her memory remains…

29
00:02:21,927 --> 00:02:23,473
Inside that jade?

30
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,988
I guess I really am a powerful priestess.

31
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,862
I can see memories that remain in objects.

32
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:39,084
I was hoping you would be happy
that I started getting my powers back,

33
00:02:40,378 --> 00:02:42,582
but you came running thinking it was her.

34
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,120
You must be disappointed.

35
00:02:45,205 --> 00:02:46,501
Yes.

36
00:02:47,961 --> 00:02:49,337
I am greatly disappointed.

37
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:53,549
I will put this back where I found it.

38
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:15,903
It collapsed again.

39
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:19,410
Why did you raise
that stone tower in the mountain?

40
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:24,084
Were you not mourning her death?
Were you praying she would come back?

41
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:26,664
You really knocked it down well.

42
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,019
Do not try to fix
what you have already broken.

43
00:03:50,162 --> 00:03:52,372
I really did not touch it.
It collapsed on its own.

44
00:03:52,463 --> 00:03:53,589
Is that so?

45
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:57,608
So you were not using your powers
to merely disappoint me?

46
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,488
I am telling the truth.

47
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,543
I found this jade by chance,

48
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,964
and when I first had a flashback,
I thought it was my memory.

49
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,629
If you had come
before I even realized anything,

50
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:15,536
I would have been happy.

51
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:20,106
Good to know that I am not the only one
who is disappointed.

52
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,880
How could you think that memory was yours?

53
00:04:22,965 --> 00:04:24,961
Because you have what was hers?

54
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,768
Did you get
any other flashbacks like this?

55
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:29,978
No.

56
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,105
That was all I saw.

57
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:37,074
Taking a peek at someone else's memory
is not exactly enjoyable, you see.

58
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,197
Take it.

59
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:46,309
Why? You said you felt elated
when you thought it was yours.

60
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,249
Tell me if you see anything else.

61
00:04:49,418 --> 00:04:51,844
Like you said,
we liked each other for a long time.

62
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,588
I am dying to know how she felt

63
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:58,089
right before she died.

64
00:04:58,173 --> 00:04:59,669
I cannot see anything else.

65
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:02,510
Let go. You are hurting me.

66
00:05:02,937 --> 00:05:04,773
Keep the jade.

67
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:07,032
You will see more as you regain powers.

68
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,572
Are you putting me
in between you and that dead girl?

69
00:05:09,657 --> 00:05:11,953
You did that yourself
by calling me with that.

70
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:19,668
Thanks to this,
I have found another use for you.

71
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:21,993
I buried questions in that stone tower,

72
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:24,606
thinking I would never
hear answers to them.

73
00:05:26,221 --> 00:05:27,569
I might be able to hear them through you.

74
00:05:27,654 --> 00:05:29,557
I called you hoping you would not come.

75
00:05:31,161 --> 00:05:32,457
You should not have come.

76
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,841
So this is why no one believed it

77
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,047
when they heard about our marriage.

78
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,178
I was excited about nothing.

79
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:48,178
You got what you wanted by marrying me.

80
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,890
You escaped from Jinyowon,

81
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:52,020
found a place to stay, and gained freedom.

82
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,645
You are right.

83
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,485
I feel more at ease now that I have
nothing to look forward to.

84
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,361
I guess this stone tower
was your real wife.

85
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,407
I will make sure

86
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,240
to build it back to how it was.

87
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:07,700
Do as you wish.

88
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,731
That jerk.

89
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,230
So this stone tower is his lawful wife,
while I am his second wife?

90
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,876
He should have told me.

91
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:43,654
Then I would not
have gotten jealous of this stone tower.

92
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:52,700
This is all Uk's fault.

93
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:56,874
That horrible, mean jerk.

94
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,512
I should have known
that he was a rotten jerk

95
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:11,972
the first time I met him.

96
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,393
No, wait.

97
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,510
He would be "a rotten husband."

98
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,879
Gosh, I am hungry.

99
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,971
What was that? A wolf?

100
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:55,311
I hope there are no tigers
on this mountain.

101
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,794
Fine! Just come and eat me alive!

102
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,128
If a tiger eats me alive,

103
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,302
then maybe he will build
a stone tower for me.

104
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,622
I was expecting a tiger,

105
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,167
but bugs came instead.

106
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,426
Did I summon them?

107
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,799
Young Lady Bu-yeon!

108
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:39,012
- My lady!
- My lady!

109
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:41,265
- My lady!
- Where are you?

110
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:44,518
- Young Lady Bu-yeon!
- Please answer if you are there!

111
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:45,727
- My lady!
- Here!

112
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,227
- My lady, where are you?
- I am right here!

113
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,112
My lady, is that you?

114
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:52,401
Oh, dear.

115
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,744
We were worried about you, my lady.

116
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,371
Let us go home now.

117
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,041
Come on down.

118
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,043
- Slowly. Be careful.
- Thank you.

119
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:13,133
It gets chilly here at night.

120
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,343
Here you go.

121
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,513
My goodness. Let us walk back down.

122
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,183
- Thank you.
- Let us go.

123
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:25,939
Did something happen, my lady?

124
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,575
Prepare a hot bath for her
as soon as we get home.

125
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:42,123
I took care of the powder incident
like you told me to, Your Royal Highness.

126
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:45,601
Report to me if you hear any rumors
about the Queen getting involved

127
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,499
with sorcery again.

128
00:11:47,802 --> 00:11:49,008
Of course.

129
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,459
But, Your Royal Highness,

130
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,711
why did you bring that to the palace?

131
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,797
I could not leave it to die
when it kept looking at me like that.

132
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,838
I was wary that the shaman
who suggested it would curse me

133
00:11:57,923 --> 00:11:59,549
so I brought it home just in case.

134
00:11:59,634 --> 00:12:00,800
A shaman?

135
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:02,638
Yes, some shaman.

136
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,807
She told me to raise this turtle
instead of having kids.

137
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,851
Who does she think she is?

138
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,020
How dare she say that
to Your Royal Highness!

139
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,480
She likely did not know.

140
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:14,191
She thought I was a eunuch.

141
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,776
- She must be ignorant.
- Then

142
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,356
I shall raise the turtle,
Your Royal Highness.

143
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,948
No, it is too late.

144
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:23,988
It already knows that I am its owner.
It only listens to me.

145
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,912
- It does?
- Yes. Watch.

146
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,622
All right, Turtle.

147
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:29,832
Stick your neck out.

148
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:32,208
Did you see that?

149
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,170
I see.

150
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,473
She said it had good energy.

151
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:41,718
It is very clever.
Next time, I should make him flip over.

152
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:45,097
But, Your Royal Highness,
turtles die if they do that.

153
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,177
- Really?
- Yes.

154
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:53,443
Turtle, do not ever flip on your back.
That is an order.

155
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,316
It is not flipping over.

156
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,401
That is one handsome turtle.

157
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:52,998
They call me Naksu, for wherever I go,
heads fall to the ground.

158
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:56,628
I will shift my soul
into a new body and return.

159
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:03,592
Help!

160
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,636
Help!

161
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,555
- Help!
- Look!

162
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,140
- Swim this way!
- Over here!

163
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,808
- Keep swimming!
- Come on!

164
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:14,186
Naksu is here!

165
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,476
Naksu is here!

166
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,191
Naksu became a grotesque

167
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,568
and killed everyone
at Lake Gyeongcheondaeho!

168
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,111
She said she would shift souls and return!

169
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:25,364
Naksu is here! Run away!

170
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:27,991
Hurry up and run! Save yourselves!

171
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,284
Naksu is here!

172
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,368
Run away!

173
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,542
Escape!

174
00:14:31,703 --> 00:14:32,746
Save yourselves!

175
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,956
- Run!
- Naksu is here!

176
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,416
- Naksu is back!
- It is Naksu!

177
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,036
- Naksu is back!
- Hurry! Run!

178
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,681
Yul, is that you?

179
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:55,519
What brings you here?

180
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:56,729
I came last night.

181
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,732
Chwiseonru is nice,
but Jeongjingak feels more like home.

182
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,487
What about you?
Why are you here and not at your house?

183
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,489
I also like it better here.

184
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,279
Should you not prefer it elsewhere?

185
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,673
You have someone waiting for you at home.

186
00:15:11,758 --> 00:15:13,514
You must have met her already.

187
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:18,187
Maidservant Kim insists that
we have a wedding ceremony.

188
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,247
I am keeping myself
out of trouble until then.

189
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,338
So it is something to congratulate, right?

190
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:27,343
Truly?

191
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,014
How do you feel? Do you feel better?

192
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,064
You were severely ill before you left.

193
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,978
You still do not look well.

194
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,768
I am still tired from the journey.

195
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,315
That is even stranger.

196
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,245
It has been days already.
That is not like you.

197
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:52,576
The air feels cold here in Jeongjingak
since it has been empty for too long.

198
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,826
It is hot outside,
but it is chilly in here.

199
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:58,457
It is probably because of me.

200
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:02,457
The ice stone attracts wraiths,
so the air around me always feels cold.

201
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:06,715
I see.

202
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,469
Then it must

203
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:13,469
always be cold for you.

204
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,606
Yul.

205
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,148
Do not pity me with that face of yours.

206
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,235
Hearing you comfort me

207
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,955
makes me want to fall into your arms
for a big hug.

208
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:38,867
I can give you a hug.

209
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,708
Come on.

210
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:44,628
What is with you?
What happened during the past three years?

211
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:48,131
- Were you lonely?
- Yes, I was.

212
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,467
- Let me hug my friend.
- What is wrong with you?

213
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,511
- Let me give you a hug.
- No, just stop.

214
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:53,761
What is going on?

215
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,926
What are you guys doing?

216
00:16:56,472 --> 00:16:58,599
Are you leaving me out
because you both slept here last night?

217
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,727
Then I might just move in here too.

218
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:03,188
Dang-go, Yul is being strange.

219
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,940
He used to be pure and naive.

220
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,651
- But look at him. He has become sly.
- Has he?

221
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:10,654
Yul was always as pure as the driven snow.

222
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:11,954
Has he become depraved?

223
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,201
Has he changed?

224
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,327
Have I changed?

225
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,371
They say you die
if you change all of a sudden.

226
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:27,942
It is good that I had a chance
to see you before that happened.

227
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,297
I am glad I returned.

228
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:32,175
Yes, but you will soon regret
having come back.

229
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:34,855
My uncle invited us
over to his place for breakfast.

230
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,599
- Tell him I went back.
- You did not see me here.

231
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,725
If you guys do not go,

232
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:42,775
I will have to finish
all three portions alone.

233
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,400
We are friends, right?

234
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:49,985
- Help me.
- What shall we do?

235
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,995
- Let us go.
- All right. Come on.

236
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,874
Right, let us go eat.

237
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,784
All right, I hope you enjoyed your meal.

238
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,084
Here is the dessert.

239
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,295
We managed to finish a whole meal,
so a rice cake will be easy.

240
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:04,958
At least this is it.

241
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,418
Normal rice cakes are boring,

242
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,545
so I came up with a name for this dessert.

243
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:11,298
These are called
"Leave-it-to-luck Rice Cakes."

244
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:15,760
Two of the three are filled with honey,
and one is filled with fish sauce.

245
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,220
Sounds fun, does it not?

246
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:18,410
It took me

247
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,251
two days…

248
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:22,893
And one night to come up with this.

249
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:25,233
Why did you even think of making this?

250
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,899
Eating this rice cake will tell you
how your day will go.

251
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:31,776
Whoever picks the fish sauce rice cake
will have a lousy day,

252
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,777
so watch out.

253
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:34,607
Go on and pick one each.

254
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,745
Fish sauce gives out a strong smell.

255
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,745
I inserted energy as I made the rice cakes
to prevent that from happening.

256
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:45,425
You will not be able to smell
the fish sauce.

257
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,716
You used your precious energy
to make rice cakes?

258
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,259
You must be bored.

259
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,344
Yes, I am.

260
00:18:57,428 --> 00:19:00,055
You can tell how bored I am
by these rice cakes.

261
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,307
Go on and pick one.

262
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,637
I struggle with making
these kinds of decisions.

263
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:06,980
Then I'll go first.

264
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:24,830
- It has honey.
- I was going to pick that one.

265
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:29,000
I do not want to be the last one.

266
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:39,803
- It has honey.
- Why did you have to do this?

267
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,805
You just turned my day into a lousy one.

268
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,025
No, Uk.

269
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,350
Why eat it? You know it has fish sauce.

270
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:46,726
You can have a bite of mine.

271
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:47,976
You guys.

272
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,773
Are you not going to check
what is inside this rice cake?

273
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:55,151
You already told us that
one was filled with fish sauce.

274
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:57,821
Are you sure, though?

275
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,241
Yes, Uncle. I believe you.

276
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:03,660
I do not wish
to risk my chances just to check.

277
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:07,120
Based on the rules, this one is filled
with fish sauce without a doubt.

278
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:11,635
If we doubt the rules,
nothing will ever be predictable.

279
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:26,104
- Is it honey?
- It has fish sauce, right?

280
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,020
What was the purpose of this joke?

281
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:33,648
Life is unpredictable,
but you choose your own destiny.

282
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,401
No matter how sweet or bitter it may be,

283
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:39,571
you must taste it yourself and swallow it.

284
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,163
I forgot the rice punch.

285
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,866
Wait here.

286
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,997
- What was it?
- Based on his logic,

287
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:59,052
neither of you will believe
what I tell you.

288
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:02,594
I am the only one who knows what I chose.

289
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,556
It was fish sauce, was it not?

290
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,522
Here you all are.

291
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:11,770
What is it?

292
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:14,939
What brings you here?

293
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:17,901
A ridiculous rumor spread overnight,
but it cannot be taken lightly.

294
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,361
What ridiculous rumor?

295
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,698
People were massacred on a boat
crossing Lake Gyeongcheondaeho,

296
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,988
and they say it was Naksu's doing.

297
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:30,914
Naksu?

298
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,583
How is that possible? She is dead.

299
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,960
They say her soul turned into a grotesque
and showed up at the lake

300
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:38,797
and claimed that
she would shift souls and return.

301
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:41,547
The capital is in an uproar
because of what happened.

302
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:52,936
Everyone, here are charms
that will protect you from Naksu's ghost!

303
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,897
These charms will protect you
from Naksu's murderous spirit!

304
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:59,025
- Gather around!
- This charm fends off soul shifters.

305
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,360
Naksu will come for your body.

306
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,402
Protect yourself with this.

307
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,032
Sure, take one.

308
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,086
Protect yourself and your family

309
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,129
- from Naksu!
- Please give me one.

310
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:21,005
- Here.
- Protect yourself with this charm.

311
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:22,225
Here you go.

312
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:30,353
I should not be selling this,
but here is one just for you.

313
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,346
Mother.

314
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:35,103
You look fine.

315
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:41,526
I checked all the boats, but none of them
had suffered a mass murder recently.

316
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:45,572
That means someone is lying
about Naksu's return.

317
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:48,122
Ghost stories about Naksu
have always been around.

318
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:52,197
But what is this story
about her returning as a soul shifter?

319
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:56,374
Soon, it will be the third anniversary
of Naksu's death.

320
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:59,669
They believe she will shift souls
and return that day.

321
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:00,879
I see.

322
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:03,265
So that is why this rumor spread.

323
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:06,799
Uk must feel perturbed.

324
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:09,888
It really is

325
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:12,017
a lousy day for him today.

326
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:14,726
I need to know who started the rumor.

327
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,729
People at Gaema Village
spread the rumor now and then

328
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,273
to make money selling charms.
Do not waste your time.

329
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:22,533
But it all started from that unknown boat.

330
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:28,452
Can you find out who it was
that swam out of the lake?

331
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:30,620
Of course.

332
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:37,290
Rumors about Naksu spread in an instant.

333
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,709
She causes trouble even after she is dead.

334
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:43,838
The young ladies of the capital
are busy searching for charms

335
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,590
to protect their bodies from Naksu.

336
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:50,600
Everyone is so afraid of Naksu,
but do they even know what she looks like?

337
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,972
I, for one, do not.

338
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,390
Do they?

339
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:57,477
Some say she was taller
and bigger than most men.

340
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:00,355
Some say she keeps herself hidden
because she is ugly.

341
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,565
On the other hand,

342
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,484
some say she is unbelievably beautiful.

343
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:05,401
Really?

344
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:07,654
Back when she was alive,
she was a shadow assassin.

345
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:09,744
Then she hid in a servant girl's body.

346
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:14,333
I guess no one knows
what she will look like this time.

347
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:15,996
That is right.

348
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:38,887
People must be very frightened of Naksu.

349
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,354
Was she that scary?

350
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:43,274
Are you here to buy a charm?

351
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:48,736
I was just curious
since everyone is buying these.

352
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,489
If that charm really does
protect you from Naksu,

353
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,324
then you will need one for sure.

354
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:56,244
She will probably be
the most upset with you

355
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,124
since you stole her lover.

356
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:01,172
Though perhaps you could not.

357
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:05,674
You knew Naksu?

358
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,674
The girl I knew was a small girl
who worked as a servant.

359
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:12,264
She was feisty and unlucky.

360
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:15,388
I placed an order for 30 charms.
I also want a pack of incense sticks.

361
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:17,306
- Sure.
- I will light them on the day she died.

362
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,851
Were you close with her?

363
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,894
Goodness, no.

364
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:25,324
I would never say that.
I have a business to run.

365
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:29,611
How about a drink?

366
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:35,950
Madam, the Crown Prince is here.

367
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,536
The Crown Prince?
It has been quite a while.

368
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,666
He asked for the cinnamon and ginger wine,
which is what he used to drink.

369
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:46,002
Young Lady, I need to go and serve
a very important customer.

370
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,002
Wait for me in the corner room.

371
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:50,349
Do we have
any cinnamon and ginger wine left?

372
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,009
The Crown Prince?

373
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:04,187
She bought so many.
These are really expensive.

374
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:05,397
Shaman.

375
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:09,781
Turtle Shaman.

376
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,486
So it is you.

377
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,069
You are that eunuch.

378
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:18,033
We meet again.

379
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:22,191
Are you also here to sell charms?

380
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,957
I see you are making money
selling such paltry items.

381
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:27,043
The owner here bought these.

382
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:30,129
You sold everything?
You must have made some money.

383
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:32,879
You can use that money to buy that turtle.

384
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,760
Did you not buy it that day?

385
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:37,510
You just left it there?

386
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:39,220
What is so bad about that?

387
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:41,224
Why would I buy something so useless?

388
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:44,435
I told you it had good energy.
It was cute too.

389
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:45,775
Cute, my foot.

390
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:49,982
Do you even know
what kind of pets I already own?

391
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:52,193
I own a peacock and a white horse.

392
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,083
They are more impressive
than mere turtles.

393
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:55,613
I see.

394
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:00,579
A turtle may not be that impressive

395
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:03,709
if he has something else in his heart.

396
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:07,957
I guess I cannot resent him

397
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,003
for abandoning me.

398
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:14,549
What?

399
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:16,181
Did someone abandon you?

400
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:20,346
My husband left and is not returning home.

401
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,556
Your husband?

402
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,476
Why?

403
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:29,694
I see.

404
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:32,689
Your husband must have
a peacock of his own.

405
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,504
I apologize for making you buy the turtle

406
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:40,825
when you already have something you like.

407
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:44,165
It may be dead,
but I should check if it is still there.

408
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,536
It is no longer there.

409
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,207
I took it home.

410
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:49,877
You said it had good energy.

411
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:53,135
I took it home
and found that it was clever and cute.

412
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:55,715
It still is nothing
compared to my peacock.

413
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,385
But it has its own charm.

414
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:00,717
So you should also

415
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:03,014
keep your chin up.

416
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,308
I was right.

417
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,646
You really are a good person.

418
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:13,858
Whatever.

419
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:18,034
How is the turtle? Is it doing well?

420
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:21,407
Do you miss it? Would you like to see it?

421
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:23,657
If so, I could bring the turtle here.

422
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,328
Can you really?

423
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:27,788
I am assuming you came here
with the Crown Prince.

424
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:29,749
Are you allowed to do that?

425
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,579
Oh, the Crown Prince…

426
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:36,380
His Royal Highness will not mind it.

427
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:40,090
He seems like a kind man.

428
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:45,014
I will leave the turtle here for a bit,
so drop by and take a look.

429
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:46,314
I will.

430
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:48,559
I should be off now.

431
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:50,939
You should also get going, Eunuch.

432
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,946
Your Royal Highness.

433
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:01,989
Do you feel better?

434
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,741
They found cinnamon and ginger wine.

435
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:04,991
Let us go in.

436
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:06,827
Forget it.

437
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:10,497
I feel better after a short chat.
Let us return to the palace.

438
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:14,465
If we go back now, Jang Uk will be there.

439
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:17,713
His Majesty summoned him
to discuss the Naksu rumor.

440
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:19,053
Jang Uk?

441
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,297
Why are you telling me that now? Move.

442
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:24,345
Well, you wanted to come for a drink.

443
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,597
Your Royal Highness!
Are you on your way to see Jang Uk?

444
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:27,807
Your Royal Highness!

445
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,692
They say Naksu the grotesque appeared
at Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.

446
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,819
The boats that need to cross
are stuck there,

447
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:42,572
and it has been
causing transportation problems.

448
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:45,157
Jang Uk, I want you
to get rid of the grotesque

449
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:46,867
and set the people's minds at ease.

450
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:49,453
If I get involved to get rid of something
that does not even exist,

451
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:52,623
it will only cause people to think
that it really does exist.

452
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:58,963
I also do not believe the rumors,
but things are getting out of hand.

453
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:01,803
Let them talk.
It will die away sooner or later.

454
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:05,720
But, Your Majesty,

455
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,722
if Jang Uk does not take action,

456
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:11,475
I am afraid it might cause people
to become even more anxious.

457
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:13,019
How so?

458
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:15,059
The soul shifter that appeared this time

459
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:19,066
is different from the soul shifters
that he previously got rid of.

460
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,494
She is Naksu.

461
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:28,284
Jang Uk, you and Naksu
were betrothed to each other.

462
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:31,414
Everyone in Daeho Fortress
knows that fact.

463
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:34,123
Your Majesty,

464
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,709
that is what concerns me.

465
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:39,337
I am afraid that people might think

466
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:42,381
that he is refusing to get involved not
because it does not exist

467
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:44,301
but because he still cares for her.

468
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:48,095
During the past three years,
Jang Uk used the power of the ice stone

469
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,640
to get rid of soul shifters
with the Unanimous Assembly's permission.

470
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:52,850
People were afraid
of the power he possessed,

471
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:55,227
but they believed he would
protect them from sorcery.

472
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:59,437
But they might start doubting that
because of this rumor about Naksu.

473
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,146
That is what worries me.

474
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:05,035
Jin Mu has a point.

475
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:09,158
Jang Uk, I want you to do your best
to get rid of Naksu the grotesque

476
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:11,448
to subdue any unnecessary concerns.

477
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,251
Yes, Your Majesty.

478
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,383
If you are so worried,

479
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:22,883
I will catch her myself.

480
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:26,549
I give you my word.

481
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,926
I will take my leave.

482
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:11,095
How can he get rid of something
that does not exist?

483
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,515
Exactly.

484
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,933
Naksu does not exist,
so he cannot get rid of her.

485
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:20,521
However, Jang Uk will forever
be haunted by her.

486
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:24,400
People believe Naksu will shift souls
and return to Jang Uk.

487
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:28,946
Every soul shifter that appears before him
will be considered to be Naksu.

488
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,699
And if that soul shifter kills anyone,

489
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:36,289
the blame will not only be placed on Naksu
but on Jang Uk as well.

490
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:41,375
Jang Uk will constantly chase after Naksu
although she does not exist,

491
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,345
and it will never end.

492
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:47,006
People's fear, doubts, and concerns
will keep him trapped

493
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,006
in a vicious cycle.

494
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:56,056
You are going to bind Jang Uk
by using Naksu against him.

495
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,426
I am doing this for you,
Your Royal Highness.

496
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,603
The first thing I will do

497
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:03,903
is to bring Jinyowon to the royal palace.

498
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:05,941
Jinyowon?

499
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:09,570
I cannot let Jang Uk marry Jin Bu-yeon,
the heir to Jinyowon.

500
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:14,030
Naksu will help us separate the two.

501
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:24,668
I found the man who saw Naksu on that boat
and swam back to land.

502
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:25,918
Who was it?

503
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:29,425
It was a man named Byeong-go.
He did odd jobs on the boat.

504
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:31,467
I think he spread the rumor

505
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:34,470
after he was paid by shamans
who make money selling charms.

506
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:38,270
He swam out of Lake Gyeongcheondaeho
in the middle of the night.

507
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,983
That is what helped spread the rumor.

508
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:45,523
He could not have risked his life
just to help spread a false rumor.

509
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:47,817
They say he gambles every chance he gets.

510
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:50,607
I will search the gambling houses
in the capital.

511
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,628
Leave Daeho Fortress for now.

512
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:15,548
Do not come back
until the sixth of next month.

513
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,304
Is that when Naksu died?

514
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:18,848
Is she really

515
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:21,138
going to shift souls and return that day?

516
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:29,233
If she really does come back,

517
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:30,693
I would like to meet her.

518
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:34,570
I have a lot of questions I need to ask.

519
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:44,829
I think I have heard enough
about their relationship.

520
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:46,250
You can stop.

521
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:49,461
This is where they first met each other.

522
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:51,301
He proposed to her here as well.

523
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:54,842
I know what happened between the two.

524
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,927
I have heard enough. Just stop.

525
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:59,555
One time when she was drunk,

526
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:02,565
Young Master Jang came
and carried her home himself.

527
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,978
She always took these honey biscuits home

528
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:09,108
because she knew how much he liked them.

529
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,166
Here. Let us drink.

530
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:43,098
Once again, I was summoned to the palace
by His Majesty the King

531
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:44,683
and my cousin, the Queen.

532
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:47,227
Yesterday, I drank tea with Gwanju Jin Mu.

533
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:50,687
Then you will not be returning
to Seoho Fortress?

534
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:55,319
Jeongjingak was established by Master Seo,
a member of the Seo family.

535
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:56,570
But since it is in ruins,

536
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,364
I plan to restore it
as a member of the Seo family.

537
00:35:58,448 --> 00:35:59,740
Jeongjingak?

538
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,330
You are incredible.

539
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:03,661
That is my plan.

540
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:06,121
I still need to talk to the Queen.

541
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,584
Where is the owner?

542
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,127
I am here to treat my guests.

543
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:16,087
She is with Jin Bu-yeon,
the eldest daughter of the Jin family.

544
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:17,840
Jin Bu-yeon?

545
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:25,140
This is where he met and proposed to her?

546
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:26,850
I should not have heard any of that.

547
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,904
Marry me.

548
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,946
What was that?

549
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:48,213
It was her memory.

550
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,791
Her memories really do keep
coming back to me.

551
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:57,089
My lady.

552
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:58,879
Someone wishes to see you.

553
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:00,968
He says you are both acquainted.

554
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,187
Yul.

555
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:13,230
Hey, long time no see.

556
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,360
Uncle Yun-o,

557
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,695
are you not heading back
to Seoho Fortress early tomorrow?

558
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,655
I have decided to stay
in the capital for a bit.

559
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,240
Yul, come sit down.

560
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,120
I only came to say goodbye.

561
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,246
I said sit.

562
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:29,715
You are in for something fun.

563
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:32,291
You know Jin Bu-yeon,
the girl I almost married, right?

564
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:33,959
I heard she was here,
so I called her over.

565
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,461
He says she is a little dull,

566
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:38,297
but he had decided to marry her
because she was pretty.

567
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:41,425
We were curious about her,
so he called her over to show her to us.

568
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:44,136
If a woman shows up to meet
the man she was previously betrothed to,

569
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,256
that would really mean she is daft.

570
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,636
You all seem to have
misunderstood my uncle.

571
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:54,104
He was extremely excited

572
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:56,734
to become the son-in-law
of the great Jin family.

573
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:59,687
But the wedding got canceled
on the day of the ceremony.

574
00:38:00,153 --> 00:38:03,659
You have no idea how disappointed he was
that the marriage fell through.

575
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:07,294
But you asked if he could show her to you?

576
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:12,079
Think about how upset and sad
he will feel if he sees her right now.

577
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:17,169
Uncle,

578
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:20,634
allow me to apologize
on behalf of my friends

579
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,378
for putting you in an awkward spot.

580
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,573
Did you call for me?

581
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,033
Yes, I did.

582
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:51,332
The night is late. Let us leave.

583
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,916
The evening only just started.

584
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,252
Did you call for me to walk me home?

585
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,462
Yes.

586
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:03,257
Will you not get lost tonight?

587
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:19,982
I apologize.

588
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,824
I was a bit worked up earlier.

589
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:24,361
I lost my way again.

590
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:26,361
You lost your way a long time ago.

591
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,236
But I stayed quiet to help you cool down.

592
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:33,788
By any chance,

593
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:36,372
are you not feeling well?

594
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:41,091
Like I said, I can see energy.

595
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:45,299
Why is there something strange
inside your body?

596
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:49,052
With that in your body, things could get...

597
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:50,262
Please just ignore it.

598
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:53,974
Please.

599
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:56,384
Leaving your illness untreated
is a foolish thing to do.

600
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:00,815
We promised

601
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:02,905
to be two foolish friends.

602
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:08,493
Please let my foolishness slide
as a friend.

603
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:28,758
Would you like some?
I packed them because they were delicious.

604
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:33,428
Eating something sweet
will make you feel better.

605
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,894
Uk loves honey biscuits.

606
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:40,274
I know.

607
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,318
That is why I packed them.

608
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:49,660
What kind of snacks do you like?

609
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:53,408
I like pine pollen tea snacks.

610
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:54,908
Really?

611
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,369
You have expensive tastes.

612
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:15,222
I once had

613
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,810
a similar conversation with someone.

614
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:23,150
Did that person ever treat you
to pine pollen tea snacks?

615
00:41:24,357 --> 00:41:25,483
Come to think of it…

616
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:27,860
She never did.

617
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:40,923
What are you doing here?

618
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:45,671
The King gave you orders.
You should be by the lake.

619
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,589
That could not have come from there.

620
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:54,049
Still, the people are scared.
Not a single boat has sailed recently.

621
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,847
Move. You are in my space.

622
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:58,347
I am going to bed.

623
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:00,985
Right…

624
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:05,308
Are you going to sleep here?

625
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,533
- No way.
- I am not here to sleep.

626
00:42:09,402 --> 00:42:10,235
What is wrong?

627
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,571
Are you so excited
that you cannot even sleep?

628
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:14,321
Because they say Naksu is coming back?

629
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,330
What are you staring at?

630
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,496
You built a stone tower
and waited for her.

631
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:26,043
That no longer exists. It collapsed.

632
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:27,253
Uk.

633
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:31,506
Did you change your mind
because of what I said?

634
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,716
Of course not.

635
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:35,220
Jin Bu-yeon smashed it down.

636
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:40,307
Actions really do speak louder than words.

637
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:43,267
She promised to protect you,
and she is doing it well.

638
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:46,273
That is what she said
when she first came to see us.

639
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:48,900
She said she would protect you.

640
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:55,203
Get out of here.
Go home and protect your wife.

641
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:58,448
I was making dumplings in the kitchen,

642
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,159
and all the ladies there were concerned

643
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:06,002
that your bride will be the first person
that Naksu goes after when she appears.

644
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:09,302
They say ghosts also get jealous.

645
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:13,263
Is that what they were after?

646
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,137
What?

647
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,176
My lord, I will eat all of your dumplings.

648
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:24,351
So let me sleep here tonight.

649
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:25,981
I have another favor to ask.

650
00:43:26,896 --> 00:43:28,022
Sure.

651
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:32,818
Uk, I will go and steam some dumplings.

652
00:43:32,902 --> 00:43:34,653
Let us take our time talking.

653
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:35,903
Goodness.

654
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:38,073
Fifty or a hundred?

655
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:39,993
First, I will bring 50.

656
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:54,089
Your Majesty,

657
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:57,551
I would like to hold a banquet
outside the palace walls.

658
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:00,681
I thought you did not wish to meet anyone
while you were in that body.

659
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:02,973
What banquet?

660
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:08,519
I heard young ladies are scared
to leave their homes because of Naksu.

661
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:13,692
It is ridiculous that the entire capital
is afraid of Naksu.

662
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:17,662
So you wish to alleviate the situation
by holding a banquet?

663
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:22,245
I plan to hold it
on the day Naksu supposedly returns.

664
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:27,956
It will be held outdoors with young ladies
who believe Naksu is after them,

665
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:31,036
and we will enjoy a beautiful

666
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,956
and extravagant banquet together.

667
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:38,758
The Queen has invited
Young Lady Jin Bu-yeon

668
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:40,218
to her banquet.

669
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:42,137
The Queen's banquet?

670
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:43,887
She has not held one in years.

671
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,558
I was invited?

672
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:52,272
Yes, my lady.

673
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:56,651
Every time I went to the Queen's banquet
with Madam Do-hwa,

674
00:44:56,735 --> 00:45:00,530
it always felt great
to watch everyone fix their eyes

675
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:02,660
on the person I helped doll up.

676
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:05,124
I will get to feel that once again.

677
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:08,413
We do not have much time.

678
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:11,673
It is time to get busy.

679
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:16,512
We need to find the right outfit first.

680
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:19,782
We must get Dressmaker Cho's outfits
before anyone else does.

681
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:21,893
Mr. Lee!

682
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,105
Fetch the next one.

683
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:30,769
Very nice.

684
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:32,395
That one is beautiful too.

685
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:33,605
No.

686
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:35,774
That will not do!

687
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:37,384
Did Dressmaker Cho truly make that?

688
00:45:38,027 --> 00:45:39,653
Yes, very nice.

689
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,536
Is it too much?

690
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:50,462
It is out of fashion.

691
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:58,088
It is too racy.

692
00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:01,466
You look pretty in everything.

693
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:04,219
How are we going to choose
out of all these outfits?

694
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:06,888
My goodness, this is just the beginning.

695
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:09,728
You should at least try on 30 outfits
before choosing.

696
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:11,441
What? 30?

697
00:46:12,353 --> 00:46:14,562
Help her try this one.

698
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:15,902
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

699
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:28,827
Hey.

700
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:30,037
Mr. Lee.

701
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:32,580
I want you to visit Dressmaker Oh now.

702
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:34,710
- Again?
- Just go.

703
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:38,003
I am sure she feels uneasy
because of that crazy rumor.

704
00:46:38,087 --> 00:46:41,339
If we exhaust her with this,
her mind will be at peace for a bit.

705
00:46:41,423 --> 00:46:43,929
All right. I will be right back.

706
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:47,178
By the way,
Young Master Jang came home earlier.

707
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:48,179
He is in his study.

708
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:49,389
Really?

709
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:51,016
He came home?

710
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:00,031
I am all changed.

711
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:02,187
How do I…

712
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:07,032
You look busy.

713
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:12,083
Your outfit is extravagant for someone
who is awfully confident about her looks.

714
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:14,664
Do not be mistaken.

715
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:17,417
I was not trying to look good for you.

716
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:19,507
Yes, I know.
The Queen invited you to a banquet.

717
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:23,167
You may not have dressed for me,
but may I see?

718
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:28,765
You look pretty.

719
00:47:36,437 --> 00:47:37,563
I mean, the outfit does.

720
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:41,692
Give me your hand.

721
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:43,068
Why?

722
00:47:43,152 --> 00:47:45,988
You hurt your hand
while taking it out on the stone tower.

723
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:49,240
Your nails have grown.

724
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:51,090
Ask Maidservant Kim to trim them for you.

725
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:52,494
I am not a child.

726
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:54,204
Why would I ask her
to trim my nails for me?

727
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:56,424
Do as I say. You are precious.

728
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:00,292
I mean, your nails are.

729
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:04,145
Why are you suddenly mentioning my nails?

730
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:06,425
All right, then.

731
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:07,934
I will leave you to it.

732
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:18,478
Wait.

733
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:23,066
By any chance…

734
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:31,491
When you go to the banquet,

735
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:33,785
sit where everyone can see you.

736
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:36,830
I want everyone there to see you that day.

737
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:38,415
No one will be interested in me.

738
00:48:38,499 --> 00:48:42,085
They will be busy talking about your wife
who might return to life that day.

739
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:44,629
That is why you should show everyone

740
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:46,259
that you are my wife now.

741
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:53,680
Then…

742
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:59,355
Can I wear the ornament
with your family crest?

743
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,814
- Sure.
- Can I also…

744
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:07,026
Tell everyone that we get along well?

745
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:11,948
- Of course.
- I will also…

746
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:15,989
Boast to everyone

747
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:19,460
that you lit up a dark path for me…

748
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:23,210
late at night.

749
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:27,215
Sure, go ahead.

750
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,446
You seem very happy tonight.

751
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:57,744
Did you like the outfits?

752
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,544
I saw some bugs.

753
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:04,500
That is why I am happy.

754
00:50:22,603 --> 00:50:24,599
Here is what Young Master Jang asked for.

755
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:27,153
Will it be safe?

756
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:28,900
Do not worry.

757
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:33,446
Will you also be attending
the banquet tonight?

758
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:34,697
Yes.

759
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:37,947
You look very pretty in that outfit.

760
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:41,704
This is what I always wear.

761
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:44,123
I will be wearing something else
for the banquet.

762
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:49,212
Are you saying you will look
even more beautiful than you do now?

763
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:50,880
Do not be ridiculous.

764
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:52,340
There is no need for that.

765
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:54,926
If you look even prettier than you do now,

766
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:59,176
imagine how intimidated
the young ladies will feel tonight.

767
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:01,641
Do you think so?

768
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:04,602
Then I guess I should tone it down.

769
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:05,979
Yes, you should.

770
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:07,021
Go easy on them.

771
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:08,441
All right.

772
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:12,193
It has been a while
since you last attended a grand event.

773
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:13,611
I hope you dress up nicely.

774
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:17,865
I like it when a man dresses
at his finest.

775
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:19,158
All right.

776
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:22,908
I will show you how dashing I can become.

777
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:40,013
Young Master Park.

778
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:47,854
Maidservant Kim.

779
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:49,314
Are you attending the event?

780
00:51:49,398 --> 00:51:52,191
Yes, I will be attending
with Young Lady Bu-yeon.

781
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:55,451
If you happen to see Cho-yeon there…

782
00:51:57,739 --> 00:52:00,035
Could you give these to her for me?

783
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:04,329
These diamonds are called
"The Dragon's Tears."

784
00:52:04,413 --> 00:52:06,829
I heard they were purchased by Songrim
not too long ago.

785
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:09,842
- How did you get your hands on...
- I bought them.

786
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:14,339
But if Young Lady Jin wears these,

787
00:52:14,423 --> 00:52:17,175
everyone will know that they are from you.

788
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:20,011
I am not sure
if she will accept this gift.

789
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,721
If she refuses to accept them,

790
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:24,352
it would mean she turned me down.

791
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:26,601
Forget it.

792
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:30,521
It will be unbearable for me
if she rejects me once and for all.

793
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:35,823
Then are you never going to
make a move on Young Lady Jin?

794
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:40,374
Do you think she will accept?

795
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:44,624
- Or will she refuse?
- We will know once we give them to her.

796
00:52:46,455 --> 00:52:47,497
I guess you are right.

797
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:50,187
You never know what is in the rice cake
until you bite into it.

798
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:03,393
Uncle,

799
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:07,180
I am hoping for honey,
but I am afraid it might be fish sauce.

800
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:10,728
But I will bravely bite into it

801
00:53:10,812 --> 00:53:12,478
and swallow my destiny.

802
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,108
Please give these to her.

803
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:26,446
The Queen's banquet is about to start.

804
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:29,455
Is Jin Bu-yeon there?

805
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:32,965
Everyone who was invited is in attendance,
so she is probably there.

806
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:34,544
What about Jang Uk?

807
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:37,924
He is sailing Lake Gyeongcheondaeho
due to the King's orders.

808
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:44,352
What if a soul shifter appears
and kills Jin Bu-yeon?

809
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:47,557
What will people think
of that soul shifter?

810
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:51,352
They will naturally believe
that the soul shifter is Naksu.

811
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:54,982
If Jin Bu-yeon gets attacked,
it will become Naksu's doing.

812
00:53:56,525 --> 00:53:58,901
Then everything will become
Jang Uk's responsibility.

813
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:04,491
Naksu will help us separate the two.

814
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:08,697
Your Royal Highness,
would you like to attend the banquet?

815
00:54:09,538 --> 00:54:11,205
It will soon be time
to choose the crown princess.

816
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:14,500
It will most likely be
one of the ladies at the banquet.

817
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,590
You should pick the woman you like.

818
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:18,922
No.

819
00:54:20,298 --> 00:54:22,008
I do not have the final say anyway.

820
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:24,177
I am afraid of what I might do

821
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:26,177
if I fall for someone I cannot have.

822
00:54:35,021 --> 00:54:37,607
I do not wish to have
someone from Songrim enter Jinyowon.

823
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:39,027
What brings you here?

824
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:44,363
I am not here on behalf of Songrim.

825
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:46,413
It is for a young lad
who is like a son to me

826
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,660
and your daughter.

827
00:54:49,744 --> 00:54:52,121
If you are talking about Bu-yeon,

828
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:55,124
tell Jang Uk to bring her back
right this instant.

829
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:57,254
Before that, let us talk about Naksu.

830
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:00,797
We must get rid of her first.

831
00:55:00,881 --> 00:55:03,216
Naksu? She is dead.

832
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,760
Do not tell me you also believe
that ridiculous rumor.

833
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:09,600
That ridiculous rumor
could end up killing your daughter.

834
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:12,852
We need Jinyowon's help.

835
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:25,947
I am Jin Cho-yeon,

836
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:27,677
the second daughter of the Jin family.

837
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:31,036
You must be

838
00:55:31,912 --> 00:55:33,788
Jin Ho-gyeong and Jin U-tak's daughter.

839
00:55:41,963 --> 00:55:44,173
I am Heo Yun-ok
of the Heo family from Wol Fortress.

840
00:55:44,257 --> 00:55:46,843
She is the granddaughter
of Master Heo Yeom.

841
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:49,846
Greetings are not needed between us.

842
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:52,636
We meet quite often
because you are my physician.

843
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:14,370
I am Jin Bu-yeon,
the eldest daughter of the Jin family.

844
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:17,039
She is betrothed to Young Master Jang Uk.

845
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:18,999
I thought they were married.

846
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:22,420
We are preparing
for a grand wedding ceremony.

847
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:24,255
We ask for your blessing.

848
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:27,133
That means she still belongs to Jinyowon.

849
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:29,176
I invited one person from each family.

850
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:31,216
But there are two people
from the Jin family.

851
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:33,649
Send the second daughter,
Jin Cho-yeon, away.

852
00:56:39,437 --> 00:56:40,271
Your Highness,

853
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:44,233
Jin Cho-yeon is the true heir of Jinyowon.

854
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:46,444
If one of us must leave,

855
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:49,664
it should be me, not my younger sister.

856
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:54,785
Forget it.

857
00:56:54,869 --> 00:56:57,715
You both came, so just enjoy the banquet.

858
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:02,168
Thank you for allowing me to attend
such a beautiful banquet.

859
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:23,231
It feels nice to be
outside the palace walls.

860
00:57:23,315 --> 00:57:24,690
All right, everyone.

861
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:26,610
Let us enjoy the banquet.

862
00:57:38,747 --> 00:57:41,003
Beautiful, are they not?

863
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:49,340
There we go!

864
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:50,758
Let us play again.

865
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:52,258
Come on, get a grip.

866
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:55,096
Let us play again. Deal the cards.

867
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:57,176
- Damn it.
- Give us the cards.

868
00:57:57,932 --> 00:57:59,388
What is that punk doing here?

869
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:01,978
I told him to stay away until tonight.

870
00:58:02,062 --> 00:58:03,271
Gosh.

871
00:58:03,355 --> 00:58:05,564
I guess his addiction called him in early.

872
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:07,692
He came to play since he had money.

873
00:58:07,776 --> 00:58:08,942
That lunatic.

874
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:13,698
All right. Let me see.

875
00:58:13,782 --> 00:58:16,198
I won! I won the money!

876
00:58:16,701 --> 00:58:18,497
Who here is Byeong-go?

877
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:24,459
Byeong-go?

878
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:28,087
Hey, leave if you are not here to gamble.

879
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:29,797
- All right?
- Get out of my way.

880
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:33,593
What are you doing?

881
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:55,569
- Be quiet and leave.
- I am sorry.

882
00:58:58,076 --> 00:58:59,493
I told you not to come back.

883
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:02,413
- You lunatic, why did you not wait?
- I am sorry.

884
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:11,339
It was you.

885
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:44,044
You must feel upset.

886
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:47,041
You were introduced as his betrothed,
not his wife.

887
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:50,341
It is all right.
He shows me more than enough affection.

888
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:55,674
Did you not take my advice to heart?

889
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:57,224
Of course, I did.

890
00:59:57,886 --> 01:00:00,346
Thanks to you,
there were some difficulties between us,

891
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:02,473
but we have become a lot closer since.

892
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:03,683
Thank you.

893
01:00:13,526 --> 01:00:17,238
Everyone, Young Master Jang

894
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:21,238
has sent fireworks
to celebrate the Queen's banquet.

895
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:26,497
We will get to see fireworks?

896
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:27,873
I have never seen them before.

897
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:30,251
He sent them because his betrothed,
Young Lady Bu-yeon,

898
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:32,962
asked him if he could lighten up

899
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:34,762
the night sky for her.

900
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:37,842
- Oh, my goodness.
- I am jealous.

901
01:00:37,926 --> 01:00:38,801
- Lucky her.
- She is lucky.

902
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:44,056
Soon, fireworks will bloom
in the night sky like flowers.

903
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,466
I hope you look forward to it.

904
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:50,771
Let us go outside.

905
01:00:50,855 --> 01:00:53,071
- Shall we watch it from outside?
- Sure.

906
01:01:04,244 --> 01:01:05,790
You should go to the back garden.

907
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,426
You came here yourself?

908
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:30,560
To lighten up the night sky?

909
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:32,855
Yes.

910
01:01:33,314 --> 01:01:35,570
Did you boast around?

911
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:37,318
Yes.

912
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:40,946
Now everyone here truly believes
that we are married.

913
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:42,156
Good.

914
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:45,116
Then Naksu will show up here soon.

915
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:47,036
Naksu?

916
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:50,866
This event was arranged to summon Naksu.

917
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:53,251
Why?

918
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:58,420
So that my wife would get killed by Naksu.

919
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:01,128
Bu-yeon.

920
01:02:02,093 --> 01:02:03,219
I am sorry,

921
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:05,763
but you will have to die now.

922
01:02:22,322 --> 01:02:23,448
Look at that!

923
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:29,036
That is beautiful.

924
01:02:44,052 --> 01:02:45,636
If a soul shifter

925
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:47,513
kills Jin Bu-yeon in front of everyone,

926
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:50,224
people will naturally think it was Naksu,

927
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:52,484
and the blame will go to Jang Uk.

928
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:55,938
Jang Uk and Jinyowon will become enemies,

929
01:02:56,022 --> 01:02:59,608
and Jinyowon will fall into our hands.

930
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:57,500
Bu-yeon!

931
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:01,090
Bu-yeon.

932
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:04,215
Bu-yeon.

933
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:05,633
That was Naksu.

934
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:10,600
Naksu murdered Jang Uk's wife,
Jin Bu-yeon.

935
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:18,062
Bu-yeon.

936
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:21,941
Bu-yeon…

937
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:45,302
Young Lady Bu-yeon is safe.

938
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:06,612
How are you alive?

939
01:05:08,446 --> 01:05:10,072
You were dead.

940
01:05:10,656 --> 01:05:12,658
The person that died just now was not me.

941
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:15,452
It was a white mouse called Gwiseo,
a relic from Jinyowon.

942
01:05:15,536 --> 01:05:16,872
"Gwiseo"?

943
01:05:17,955 --> 01:05:19,915
A mouse that eats the clippings

944
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:23,325
of someone who trims their nails at night
can take the appearance of that person.

945
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:26,416
The mouse that ate
Young Lady Bu-yeon's nail clippings

946
01:05:27,006 --> 01:05:29,591
was the one that got stabbed.

947
01:05:29,675 --> 01:05:30,801
She is right.

948
01:05:31,511 --> 01:05:34,387
What you saw earlier
was Gwiseo from Jinyowon.

949
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:40,940
How did that get here?

950
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:46,281
Your mother sent it here
to protect her eldest daughter.

951
01:06:04,001 --> 01:06:06,879
It looks like everything went well.

952
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:08,509
Now, Uk just needs to go

953
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:12,008
and get rid of the soul shifter.

954
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:18,265
The soul shifter that attacked me

955
01:06:18,349 --> 01:06:21,235
is currently being chased
by Young Master Jang.

956
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:27,275
If I do not get rid of Naksu myself,

957
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:30,356
people will constantly
spread rumors about her.

958
01:06:32,029 --> 01:06:33,655
I want her to rest in peace.

959
01:06:33,739 --> 01:06:34,865
So…

960
01:06:37,743 --> 01:06:39,079
Help me out.

961
01:06:41,038 --> 01:06:43,294
Once he gets rid of
Naksu the soul shifter,

962
01:06:43,958 --> 01:06:45,084
she will forever

963
01:06:46,377 --> 01:06:47,963
be gone from our lives.

964
01:07:03,102 --> 01:07:04,228
She is not moving.

965
01:07:04,312 --> 01:07:06,021
I think she is dead.

966
01:07:06,105 --> 01:07:08,071
- She looks dead.
- Goodness.

967
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:42,808
Today, I got rid of Naksu,
the soul shifter that appeared

968
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:44,518
at the Queen's banquet.

969
01:07:45,645 --> 01:07:47,731
Was it really Naksu?

970
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:51,896
She was after Jang Uk's betrothed,
so it must have been her.

971
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:54,696
Now Naksu is gone

972
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:56,864
for good.

973
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:02,079
I hope this puts you at ease…

974
01:08:04,038 --> 01:08:05,414
And gives you peace.

975
01:08:27,019 --> 01:08:29,104
I made the rumor
with the shamans at Gaema Village

976
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:31,574
so that we could make some money
selling charms.

977
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:37,452
All I did was make up a rumor.
Arrest me if you wish.

978
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:45,352
You kept sending me medicine, right?

979
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:49,793
You must know what is inside my body.

980
01:08:52,086 --> 01:08:53,552
You will be fine

981
01:08:54,422 --> 01:08:55,868
as long as you take the medicine.

982
01:08:56,424 --> 01:08:57,550
I…

983
01:08:59,593 --> 01:09:01,349
Did not take the medicine you sent.

984
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:05,142
You did not take it?

985
01:09:06,767 --> 01:09:09,153
Without that medicine,
you must be in severe pain.

986
01:09:09,729 --> 01:09:10,855
Tell me.

987
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:12,733
What is inside my body?

988
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:16,865
I would at least like to know…

989
01:09:18,863 --> 01:09:20,029
Before I die.

990
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:29,915
I heard Naksu died.

991
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:32,125
- Yes, that is right.
- Tell me in detail.

992
01:09:32,209 --> 01:09:33,043
Yeom.

993
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:34,593
I am here.

994
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:37,922
- Yeom!
- Master Lee!

995
01:09:39,133 --> 01:09:40,259
Master Lee!

996
01:09:42,803 --> 01:09:43,929
Master Lee!

997
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:45,723
Master Lee.

998
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:51,687
Master Lee,

999
01:09:51,771 --> 01:09:53,605
where have you been?

1000
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:55,107
It has been three years.

1001
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:58,107
Yeom, you have aged even more
in those three years.

1002
01:10:00,154 --> 01:10:03,365
Where did you stay?

1003
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:04,574
You were not at Danhyanggok.

1004
01:10:04,658 --> 01:10:07,035
I spent time treating a patient.

1005
01:10:07,119 --> 01:10:08,078
A patient?

1006
01:10:08,162 --> 01:10:09,868
Lady Jin's daughter.

1007
01:10:10,456 --> 01:10:12,374
I heard she recently married Jang Uk.

1008
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:13,584
What?

1009
01:10:13,793 --> 01:10:16,920
You treated Jin Bu-yeon?

1010
01:10:17,004 --> 01:10:18,130
Yes.

1011
01:10:18,506 --> 01:10:21,432
I saved her life, woke her up,

1012
01:10:22,301 --> 01:10:23,707
and erased what was unnecessary.

1013
01:10:37,191 --> 01:10:38,317
You did not visit

1014
01:10:38,609 --> 01:10:41,035
the cliff where she met her demise,
did you?

1015
01:10:41,862 --> 01:10:42,988
See for yourself

1016
01:10:43,572 --> 01:10:44,738
and then mourn for her.

1017
01:11:04,885 --> 01:11:06,351
I want her to rest in peace.

1018
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,806
It may not have been Naksu,

1019
01:11:10,516 --> 01:11:12,601
but more wraiths tend to swarm around him

1020
01:11:12,685 --> 01:11:15,351
on days when he uses
the power of the ice stone.

1021
01:11:26,574 --> 01:11:28,580
You are the first person

1022
01:11:29,743 --> 01:11:31,409
who tried to save me.

1023
01:11:32,413 --> 01:11:33,999
I almost died thanks to you.

1024
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:36,827
My crazy master.

1025
01:11:38,085 --> 01:11:39,631
My pupil.

1026
01:11:40,629 --> 01:11:41,922
I, Jang Uk, your pupil,

1027
01:11:42,006 --> 01:11:44,972
will serve and protect my master,
Mu-deok, with all my heart.

1028
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:51,266
I am the egg
that is at the top of the tree.

1029
01:11:52,183 --> 01:11:54,389
You are the only one
who can take care of me.

1030
01:11:55,227 --> 01:11:56,353
Fine.

1031
01:11:56,729 --> 01:12:00,075
I will take you to the top of that tree.

1032
01:12:03,235 --> 01:12:04,451
I also missed you.

1033
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:06,486
That is my reply.

1034
01:12:08,657 --> 01:12:09,783
Jang Uk.

1035
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:12,576
I like you a lot.

1036
01:12:18,375 --> 01:12:19,501
Jang Uk.

1037
01:12:54,411 --> 01:12:55,537
Jang Uk.

1038
01:12:56,538 --> 01:12:57,714
Are you all right?

1039
01:13:09,551 --> 01:13:10,797
I could not cry.

1040
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:14,348
It felt like…

1041
01:13:16,642 --> 01:13:18,518
I was really abandoning you there.

1042
01:15:25,479 --> 01:15:28,525
ALCHEMY OF SOULS  PART 2
<font color="#fff450">ALCHEMY OF SOULS  Season 02  Episode 04</font>

1043
01:15:29,066 --> 01:15:30,792
There is no need to force them together…

1044
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:36,197
You have taken what Jin Ho-gyeong
has tried so hard to hide.

1045
01:15:36,281 --> 01:15:37,324
You should stop as well, Gwanju.

1046
01:15:37,408 --> 01:15:39,284
If you wish to stop me,

1047
01:15:39,369 --> 01:15:42,214
you should go to Jang Uk
and reveal everything to him.

1048
01:15:42,299 --> 01:15:44,386
I returned to settle things one last time.

1049
01:15:44,471 --> 01:15:46,136
You look like you are about to cry.

1050
01:15:46,221 --> 01:15:49,916
Tear out the heart and break it to pieces…

1051
01:15:50,601 --> 01:15:53,557
I shall always stay by your side
at this distance.

1052
01:15:54,852 --> 01:15:56,229
That is my promise.

1053
01:15:57,845 --> 01:16:02,981
