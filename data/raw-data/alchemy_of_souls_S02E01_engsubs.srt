ALCHEMY OF SOULS
PART 2

2
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:13,448
We have brought the liquor
to be used for Jinyowon's ancestral rites.

3
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:30,340
You have used different water to make it.

4
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:35,012
You see, due to the drought
for the past three years,

5
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:37,264
the well we always used had dried up.

6
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,787
So we had to use a different source.

7
00:01:45,354 --> 00:01:47,024
- Goodness!
- Goodness!

8
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,652
- No!
- What...

9
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:53,195
Make them again.

10
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:55,865
Pardon?

11
00:01:55,948 --> 00:01:58,284
But we have no water.

12
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,120
How could we possibly make any liquor?

13
00:02:01,203 --> 00:02:05,459
Or could you let us use
some of Jinyowon's water, my lady?

14
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:14,550
He can come inside and get it.

15
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,510
- Yes, my lady.
- Me?

16
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:20,681
Go.

17
00:02:23,225 --> 00:02:24,269
- Hurry.
- Go.

18
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,616
The young lady has disappeared
from her room again.

19
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:40,534
Stay right here and wait for me.

20
00:02:41,118 --> 00:02:42,371
Yes, I will.

21
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,088
How beautiful.

22
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,348
Is that liquor?

23
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:51,521
Here you go.

24
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:04,995
This is of good quality.

25
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,329
It is fragrant.

26
00:04:08,372 --> 00:04:09,372
Do you have more?

27
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,669
I do have one more bottle.

28
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:14,795
- Give it to me.
- All right.

29
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,632
My lady!

30
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,595
- Search over there.
- Hurry.

31
00:04:21,677 --> 00:04:23,555
Yes, here you go.

32
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,514
Wait.

33
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,413
How beautiful.

34
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,923
I have never seen
such a beautiful woman before.

35
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:00,007
I think she is from the Jin family.

36
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:04,012
Young Lady Jin Cho-yeon
is the only daughter they have.

37
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,889
It is Jinyowon, after all.

38
00:05:06,555 --> 00:05:08,057
He was likely possessed by a relic.

39
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,310
They have forbidden outsiders
from entering for three years.

40
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,896
It must be teeming with ghosts.

41
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,110
Whether she was a ghost or not,
I hope I can see her again.

42
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:20,444
You littleâ€¦

43
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:23,531
Do not talk about ghosts
when we are delivering funeral drinks.

44
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:24,783
- Jeez.
- My apologies.

45
00:05:24,865 --> 00:05:26,076
Before we go insideâ€¦

46
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,745
This charm will fend off ghosts. Take one.

47
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:29,829
What is this?

48
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:33,582
This works on soul shifters too.

49
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,877
You remember Naksu, the soul shifter
who devastated Songrim three years ago?

50
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:39,880
Her petrified body was ground to a powder

51
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:42,007
and used to make these charms.

52
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,425
- With her petrified body?
- Yes.

53
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,136
That is absurd.

54
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,264
Her body is at the bottom
of Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.

55
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,432
Jeez.

56
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:53,060
I cannot believe you bought this.
You wasted your money.

57
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,812
Come on!

58
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:57,023
Trust me on this.

59
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:58,817
If you see a soul shifter,

60
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:02,444
show it this charm
that contains Naksu's energy and...

61
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,160
Did you do that?

62
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,127
No!

63
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,672
Wait for me! Do not leave me!

64
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:36,771
- What is that?
- Darn it!

65
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:49,617
Is this the deed of a soul shifter?

66
00:06:52,661 --> 00:06:53,781
- Who is that?
- Who is that?

67
00:07:18,228 --> 00:07:19,521
Is he a soul shifter?

68
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,190
Are we going to die?

69
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,776
Stay away!

70
00:07:22,858 --> 00:07:24,944
- Go away.
- Stay away!

71
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,028
- Go away!
- Leave!

72
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,529
- Stay back!
- We should go!

73
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:28,865
Wait.

74
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,785
He must not be a soul shifter.

75
00:07:33,827 --> 00:07:35,204
What is that?

76
00:07:36,288 --> 00:07:37,165
A charm.

77
00:07:37,247 --> 00:07:38,582
Does that fend off soul shifters?

78
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:42,108
Where did you get it? Gaema Village?

79
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,463
Yes.

80
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:46,716
- For how much?
- One silver <i><font color="white">nyang.</font></i>

81
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,425
- For three?
- No.

82
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,052
For one. It was three <i><font color="white">nyang</font></i> in total.

83
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:52,639
My lord.

84
00:07:53,555 --> 00:07:54,555
That is expensive.

85
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,101
That village lacks business ethics.

86
00:07:58,103 --> 00:07:59,937
You can get ten for one <i><font color="white">nyang</font></i> elsewhere.

87
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,648
Really? Which village?

88
00:08:02,564 --> 00:08:03,608
That is not the point!

89
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:04,942
Darn it.

90
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,153
You should get your money's worth.

91
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,211
If you want to live,

92
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,505
step aside and duck.

93
00:10:06,313 --> 00:10:07,374
Despite having the ice stone,

94
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:10,275
can your Tansu skills only make one drop?

95
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,986
Since your body has died already,

96
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:15,657
you are a soul shifter just like me.

97
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:18,158
To others,

98
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:19,619
we are both monsters.

99
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:22,663
Are you done?

100
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,875
If not, hurry up because that one drop

101
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,496
is going to be quite painful.

102
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:51,317
You do not deserve to say anything
when you shifted into your son's body.

103
00:11:20,053 --> 00:11:21,722
So you are not a soul shifter

104
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,932
but a mage who kills soul shifters.

105
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:28,270
Thank you for saving us, my lord.

106
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:31,274
- Is that a bottle of liquor?
- Yes, my lord.

107
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,746
Goodness.

108
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,539
His father shifted into his body?

109
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,417
Poor boy.

110
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,921
It is true that soul shifters petrify
when they are dead.

111
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,340
My lord.

112
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,174
Then Naksu died and was petrified, right?

113
00:11:58,216 --> 00:11:59,552
I told you, I was right.

114
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:04,557
These charms were indeed made
with the remains of her petrified body.

115
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:10,647
This charm will protect us
from monsters like her.

116
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,230
My lord.

117
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,149
Would you like one?

118
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:30,499
This charm

119
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:33,461
will protect you from Naksu?

120
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:38,465
People must think

121
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:41,469
she is still alive.

122
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:44,471
Goodness. Naksu is dead, of course.

123
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,265
Despite her body
lying in Lake Gyeongcheondaeho,

124
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,894
people are still terrified of her.

125
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:04,075
The men from Songrim
will clean up here soon.

126
00:13:08,578 --> 00:13:10,038
My lord, what is your name?

127
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:15,086
I think I know who he is.

128
00:13:16,461 --> 00:13:17,797
He is the one who reached Hwansu

129
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,424
with the ice stone.

130
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:23,344
He is that mage.

131
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,263
The one whom Naksu almost killed?

132
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:27,724
Young Master Jang?

133
00:13:29,057 --> 00:13:32,186
What kind of relationship
did those two have?

134
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,701
<i><font color="white">This charm will protect us from Naksu.</font></i>

135
00:13:49,077 --> 00:13:50,077
If I keep this with me,

136
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,088
I will not be able to see you
even if you come.

137
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:42,255
<i><font color="white">Naksu was a maid of his.</font></i>

138
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,384
<i><font color="white">She was also his betrothed.</font></i>

139
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,764
<i><font color="white">And in return for his unconditional love,</font></i>

140
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:51,807
<i><font color="white">she stabbed him</font></i>

141
00:14:52,682 --> 00:14:55,894
<i><font color="white">in the heart with a sword.</font></i>

142
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:47,613
ALCHEMY OF SOULS
PART 2

143
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:55,288
<i><font color="white">The energy of the sky
rules the wind, clouds, and rain.</font></i>

144
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:59,584
<i><font color="white">This energy reached the ground
and created a huge form of energy.</font></i>

145
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,713
<i><font color="white">A country was built around
Lake Gyeongcheondaeho,</font></i>

146
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:04,991
<i><font color="white">a lake that embodied that energy.</font></i>

147
00:16:05,755 --> 00:16:07,424
<i><font color="white">The name of the country was Daeho</font></i>

148
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:09,539
<i><font color="white">due to the enormous lake it had.</font></i>

149
00:16:10,802 --> 00:16:14,182
<i><font color="white">This story is about the mages of Daeho,
a place that does not exist</font></i>

150
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,642
<i><font color="white">in both history books or maps.</font></i>

151
00:16:27,068 --> 00:16:29,029
That looks delicious.

152
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,284
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

153
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:11,696
It must be a soul shifter.

154
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:13,532
I am terrified.

155
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:26,961
Did you lose her?

156
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:30,758
She fled into Jinyowon, of all places.

157
00:17:35,011 --> 00:17:36,011
Jinyowon?

158
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:42,603
JINYOWON

159
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:45,730
Outsiders are not allowed
to enter Jinyowon.

160
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:47,567
I am aware that for the past three years,

161
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,944
Jinyowon has forbidden
outsiders from entering.

162
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,698
But this is an urgent situation.
A soul shifter has hidden inside.

163
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,157
Ask Lady Jin to come and see me.

164
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,243
She will still say no.

165
00:17:58,743 --> 00:18:00,413
He is the leader of Songrim.

166
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:04,584
How dare a low-ranking priestess
refuse to relay his message?

167
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,627
- My apologies.
- Open the gate this instant!

168
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,038
Young Lady Jin.

169
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,314
I have not seen you for three years.

170
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:49,086
Have you been well?

171
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,338
I did not come out here
to send my regards.

172
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:55,675
My mother refuses
to allow outsiders to enter Jinyowon.

173
00:18:57,677 --> 00:18:58,762
So you should go.

174
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,015
It is a dangerous situation.

175
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:04,226
A soul shifter has harmed
dozens of lives at Yeongpo Dock.

176
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,144
The people of Jinyowon could get hurt too.

177
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,646
Just like my father did?

178
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:13,068
How could you possibly save anyone
when you failed to save

179
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:16,279
the father of your betrothed?

180
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:21,535
After what happened,

181
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,874
you never gave me the chance to apologize.

182
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,417
So it laid heavy on my heart.

183
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:30,711
Then keep feeling guilty.

184
00:19:32,128 --> 00:19:33,631
I hope you never forget it.

185
00:19:34,964 --> 00:19:36,217
Young Lady Jin.

186
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:37,509
You should go.

187
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:21,428
Did someone

188
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,306
just enter Jinyowon?

189
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:27,892
Yes.

190
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:30,186
I believe it was Jang Uk.

191
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,357
He has been chasing
the soul shifter with us.

192
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:36,277
Jang Uk?

193
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,989
Are you saying he just stepped inside?

194
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:41,780
He is only obeying

195
00:20:42,365 --> 00:20:44,993
the order of the royal family
and the Unanimous Assembly.

196
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:48,497
I shall close the gate.

197
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,415
You should go.

198
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:08,392
There is no doubt
that Uk will catch the soul shifter.

199
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:10,227
We can just wait here.

200
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:13,145
Sure.

201
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,157
Jang Uk

202
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,701
is in Jinyowon?

203
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:26,785
Yes.

204
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:29,413
He is here to catch
the soul shifter in hiding.

205
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:33,041
Is Bu-yeon still in the annex
as she was told?

206
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,795
There is a barrier around her room,

207
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:37,922
so it will be near invisible
to the naked eye.

208
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:41,634
Jang Uk will never find her.

209
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:34,853
You must have shifted a long time ago.

210
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:45,654
What is this?

211
00:23:26,821 --> 00:23:27,823
What is this place?

212
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:30,950
A prison?

213
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:02,773
Do not touch that.

214
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,532
Who are you? How did you get in here?

215
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:25,213
You must be insane.

216
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,340
You seem to be a lousy Jinyowon priestess.

217
00:24:27,423 --> 00:24:29,093
How dare you aim that fire poker at me?

218
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:32,304
Incredible.

219
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:36,933
Did you enter this room
after breaking the surrounding barrier?

220
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:39,019
As a priestess, you must know who I am.

221
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:41,145
Who are you?

222
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,065
And what is this place?

223
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:45,651
Is this a prison?

224
00:24:45,733 --> 00:24:47,694
Are you locked in here?

225
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:50,779
It is not a prison.

226
00:24:55,993 --> 00:24:57,496
I could use this as a step.

227
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,711
Throw this onto the wall too.

228
00:25:05,461 --> 00:25:06,461
What?

229
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,007
Is it too flat?

230
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:11,719
Thenâ€¦

231
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:20,184
Is this better? Or this?

232
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,691
Which one would be better?

233
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:31,238
You must be locked up here.

234
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,364
Are they no good?

235
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:34,950
You must be ill.

236
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:37,117
Would this be better?

237
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:38,827
Are you leaving?

238
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:41,832
All right, then take me with you.

239
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:50,715
You want

240
00:25:51,842 --> 00:25:52,925
to leave with me?

241
00:25:53,634 --> 00:25:55,511
I have not gone out in ages.

242
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,894
I smell the flowers on your clothing.

243
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:05,271
The roses must have bloomed already.

244
00:26:07,273 --> 00:26:08,273
Look.

245
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:11,487
I understand that you are crazy
about going outside.

246
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:13,780
But I cannot help you.

247
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:16,407
You can use that instead to go outside.

248
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:18,493
But that will be exhausting.

249
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:20,703
- I want to go with you.
- Hey, Lousy Priestess.

250
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:25,666
Step back unless you want
to end up like that fire poker.

251
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:29,378
I am not used

252
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:32,257
to having people stand so close.

253
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:47,940
That is a pretty stone.

254
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:52,652
You must have

255
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:55,029
the energy of the sky.

256
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,034
I guess you are not all that lousy.

257
00:26:59,116 --> 00:27:00,116
You.

258
00:27:00,701 --> 00:27:02,119
Can you see what is inside me?

259
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,038
Yes.

260
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:06,208
I can see the energy of the world.

261
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:09,627
I have heard of a priestess
who could do that.

262
00:27:10,586 --> 00:27:11,586
So it was you?

263
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,384
Tell me. Who are you?

264
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:18,886
I cannot reveal who I am
due to a certain reason.

265
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,431
But once you find out who I am,

266
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:24,601
you will definitely want
to take me out of here.

267
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:32,067
Where is Jang Uk?

268
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,486
I found traces of
his fight with the soul shifter.

269
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:35,903
Even near Bu-yeon's annex?

270
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:38,699
I did not look there due to the barrier.

271
00:27:38,781 --> 00:27:41,535
No. That is the most vulnerable place.

272
00:27:41,617 --> 00:27:44,579
It would be terrible
if he ever were to run into her.

273
00:27:49,375 --> 00:27:52,170
Seeing how they even
imprisoned you with a barrier,

274
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:54,006
I guess you are not simply crazy.

275
00:27:54,088 --> 00:27:57,174
If you get me out of here,
I will tell you who I am.

276
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,260
You will be utterly shocked.

277
00:28:02,096 --> 00:28:04,182
- Forget it.
- Are you not curious about me?

278
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:06,977
Jinyowon and I have bad blood.

279
00:28:07,059 --> 00:28:10,271
I do not want to let you out
and worsen our relationship even more.

280
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,191
You have bad blood with Jinyowon?

281
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:16,986
You.

282
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,869
Was this to help you escape?

283
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:28,373
Well, it is pretty lousy.

284
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:30,166
It took me three whole days to make that.

285
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:34,336
Three days?

286
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:39,926
Hey!

287
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:45,949
If you do not want to take me, fine.

288
00:28:45,973 --> 00:28:47,392
But did you have to do that?

289
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:49,978
They will suspect me
if you escape soon after I leave.

290
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,730
I want to avoid unnecessary trouble.

291
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,764
It took you three days, right?

292
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:56,609
So postpone your escape by three days
so it will not affect me.

293
00:29:02,531 --> 00:29:04,534
It will just be an outing, not an escape.

294
00:29:05,701 --> 00:29:08,538
Even if I get out of here,

295
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,415
I have no choice but to return.

296
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:21,843
Why did they lock up
such an incredible priestess?

297
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,380
What crime are you guilty of?

298
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,182
Being alive.

299
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:30,102
Existing in this world.

300
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:33,646
I am guilty

301
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:36,607
of existing in this world
when I should not.

302
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:41,529
I am someone who died a long time ago.

303
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:48,896
It must have been Jang Uk's doing.

304
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:52,624
He must have come very close to the annex.

305
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:10,098
Bu-yeon.

306
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,145
Bu-yeon.

307
00:30:15,521 --> 00:30:17,481
Did anyone come in here?

308
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:18,650
No.

309
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:22,153
Who else could come in here
except for you and Mother?

310
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:28,326
What is the matter?

311
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:30,119
Did something happen?

312
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:33,093
A soul shifter entered
and hid in Jinyowon.

313
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,209
A mage also entered to catch her

314
00:30:36,917 --> 00:30:38,295
and caused havoc.

315
00:30:38,377 --> 00:30:39,503
A soul shifter?

316
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:42,465
A monster whose soul
is different from its body?

317
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:45,175
Yes.

318
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:48,430
But we killed the soul shifter,
so do not worry.

319
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:06,030
<i><font color="white">So he was a mage
who came here to kill the soul shifter.</font></i>

320
00:31:12,703 --> 00:31:15,332
This will be enough to help you escape.

321
00:31:19,251 --> 00:31:20,586
Remember what I said.

322
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:23,632
Do not tell them about me
and wait before you get out.

323
00:31:24,715 --> 00:31:25,800
I will.

324
00:31:28,135 --> 00:31:29,971
Can you do two more?

325
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:32,723
I am not as tall as you.

326
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:33,849
Will two suffice?

327
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:36,688
- You are pretty short.
- Then you will do three?

328
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:39,563
Thanks.

329
00:31:40,981 --> 00:31:41,981
Jeez.

330
00:31:43,734 --> 00:31:46,695
By the way, why are you helping me?

331
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:48,906
Why the change of heart?

332
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:51,951
Because we are guilty of the same crime.

333
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,372
I am also guilty of existing

334
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:57,957
when I should not.

335
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:14,348
Someone guilty of the same crimeâ€¦

336
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:35,912
The roses must have really bloomed.

337
00:32:56,932 --> 00:32:59,310
SONGRIM

338
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:05,442
This soul shifter entered
a cargo boat at Yeongpo Dock

339
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:07,611
and slaughtered everyone inside.

340
00:33:07,693 --> 00:33:10,864
We are constantly finding
soul shifters running rampant.

341
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,659
And Uk killed them all.

342
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:19,413
That is because everyone agreed
that would be how to make use of Jang Uk,

343
00:33:20,539 --> 00:33:22,416
who was reborn
with the power of the ice stone.

344
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,667
That is not true.

345
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,462
He just complied with that decision.

346
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:28,672
Are you still

347
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:32,259
awkward around him?

348
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:36,306
Yul has returned to Seoho Fortress.

349
00:33:36,388 --> 00:33:37,848
You are the only friend he has.

350
00:33:38,432 --> 00:33:41,228
You should not distance yourself from him.

351
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,396
That is not my intention.

352
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:46,065
I just

353
00:33:47,651 --> 00:33:49,568
do not know how to act around him.

354
00:33:51,445 --> 00:33:54,657
I cannot laud him by claiming
to envy the great power he holds.

355
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,077
But I cannot empathize with him

356
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:00,652
and tell him to give up either.

357
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:04,375
Things are not how they used to be.

358
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,461
Since he used the ice stone's power

359
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:09,338
to kill this soul shifter,

360
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:13,260
he will have trouble
sleeping tonight as well.

361
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:14,342
Oh, dear.

362
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:24,896
Songrim told me.

363
00:34:25,771 --> 00:34:28,315
Young Master, are you all right?

364
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,277
I am always fine.

365
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:34,947
Worrying about me
will be the death of you.

366
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:36,324
I told you not to worry.

367
00:34:40,869 --> 00:34:42,246
Since you used that sword,

368
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,916
you will struggle tonight as well.

369
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,626
I am used to it now.

370
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:48,920
It is bearable.

371
00:34:58,554 --> 00:34:59,806
Did you heat up his room?

372
00:35:00,889 --> 00:35:03,476
Prepare some strong liquor
and place a brazier inside.

373
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:08,063
I am too scared to enter his room.

374
00:35:08,148 --> 00:35:10,442
I get goosebumps,
and chills run down my spine

375
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:12,693
- if I am nearby.
- Goodness.

376
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,822
Light the brazier,
and I will carry it inside.

377
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:16,905
Yes, ma'am.

378
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:47,103
<i><font color="white">- Save me.
- Please help me.</font></i>

379
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,606
<i><font color="white">I do not want to die.</font></i>

380
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:53,693
<i><font color="white">Give me the ice stone!</font></i>

381
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:02,661
<i><font color="white">Since he used the energy of the sky,</font></i>

382
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:05,914
<i><font color="white">the wraiths swarm toward him
to feed on that power.</font></i>

383
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:10,960
<i><font color="white">They are noisy, cold,
unsightly, and pitiful.</font></i>

384
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:14,505
<i><font color="white">That is the price one must pay
for taking the ice stone</font></i>

385
00:36:14,588 --> 00:36:15,923
<i><font color="white">and using the energy of the sky.</font></i>

386
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:35,902
Yeongpo Dock will be closed for now

387
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:38,112
due to losing many workers
to the soul shifter.

388
00:36:38,195 --> 00:36:40,824
You must deliver the goods
to Wol Fortress by land.

389
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:43,326
Daegangtongun will be the quickest.

390
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:44,409
Yes, my lord.

391
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:53,920
Young Master Park finally looks like
the leader of Songrim.

392
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:57,172
He may not have been
the best at casting spells,

393
00:36:57,257 --> 00:37:00,009
but he is an excellent businessman.

394
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:05,222
- Young Lady Heo.
- Yes?

395
00:37:18,193 --> 00:37:21,655
Has Young Lady Heo decided not
to return to Wol Fortress?

396
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:25,577
She is tending to the body
that the Queen's soul resides in.

397
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,077
So she cannot leave.

398
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:30,206
Did you say she visited your place again?

399
00:37:30,956 --> 00:37:31,956
Yes, my lord.

400
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:35,210
She is worried about how
our young master cannot sleep well,

401
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:38,465
so she always brings him medicine
that she concocts.

402
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:43,052
And has Uk ever thanked her
by offering her some tea?

403
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:48,182
I understand how she feels,
so I try my best to help out.

404
00:37:48,974 --> 00:37:50,059
But it is difficult.

405
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:51,226
Goodness.

406
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:55,231
I keep telling her to give up on him,

407
00:37:55,315 --> 00:37:56,858
but it is not working.

408
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,485
I will keep trying.

409
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:02,070
Goodness. By the way,
will you be visiting Park Jin?

410
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:03,530
- Yes, my lord.
- If you do,

411
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:06,492
can you please dissuade him

412
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:09,746
from continuing his new hobby?

413
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:13,666
All the people of Songrim
have pickled tongues thanks to him.

414
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,168
Pickled tongues?

415
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:16,795
Our tongues are a mess.

416
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:18,880
What could he possibly be doing?

417
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:19,963
Goodness.

418
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:09,681
My lord.

419
00:39:10,722 --> 00:39:12,016
What are you up to?

420
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:13,768
Hello, Maidservant Kim.

421
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,936
I am making cubed radish kimchi today.

422
00:39:16,019 --> 00:39:18,231
You are making all of this?

423
00:39:18,313 --> 00:39:21,442
You have no idea
how delighted those in the kitchen are

424
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:24,027
whenever I give them
new batches of kimchi.

425
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:25,612
Right.

426
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:27,824
I did hear that you gave them five crocks

427
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:30,284
of mustard leaf kimchi
and green onion kimchi last time.

428
00:39:30,367 --> 00:39:32,286
It was not that tiring to make,

429
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:34,746
and I only did it to kill time.

430
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:38,793
But they seem
to be waiting for my kimchi now.

431
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:42,088
I do not think they are
that desperate for the kimchi.

432
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:44,882
There is no need for all this.

433
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:48,427
They cannot openly ask for more
since they are intimidated by me.

434
00:39:49,596 --> 00:39:50,596
But I am not that dense.

435
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:52,681
I ought to give them more.

436
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:54,893
I need more garlic.

437
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:56,686
I will be back.

438
00:40:01,648 --> 00:40:03,483
Gosh, everyone told me to stop him.

439
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:23,128
I get why Maidservant Park said
this was driving her crazy.

440
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:27,257
This is too much to throw away.

441
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:29,010
It will only torment the eater.

442
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:38,476
I see.

443
00:40:39,394 --> 00:40:42,690
My lord, I need some radish.

444
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,567
Can I use those?

445
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:45,568
Sure.

446
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:48,320
But then I will not have enough
to make cubed radish kimchi with.

447
00:40:48,403 --> 00:40:50,447
Come on. This is already enough.

448
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:53,199
They will appreciate it more
if it is not abundant.

449
00:40:53,992 --> 00:40:55,077
That is true.

450
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:58,623
- Have a seat.
- Yes, my lord.

451
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:10,717
Do you feel empty inside
after stepping down from being a leader?

452
00:41:12,177 --> 00:41:14,722
I tend to the field and the flowers.

453
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:17,307
I also do housework. It is all quite fun.

454
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:33,282
You have planted many balsam seeds.

455
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:38,661
Young Master Jang

456
00:41:39,621 --> 00:41:41,081
is still very ill.

457
00:41:44,751 --> 00:41:45,961
I am afraid

458
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:49,132
I will have to be
by his side this year as well.

459
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:52,842
I understand.

460
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:55,179
Three years ago,

461
00:41:56,054 --> 00:41:58,766
you took responsibility
for everything and stepped down.

462
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:01,768
I did not once dissuade you.

463
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:05,106
Rather, I brazenly thanked you.

464
00:42:07,065 --> 00:42:10,152
I was only relieved that my young master

465
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:12,864
was spared.

466
00:42:15,949 --> 00:42:18,869
We have not peeled the garlic yet,
but you are already crying.

467
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:23,123
We need to peel all of these.

468
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,460
Yes, my lord.

469
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:28,920
I will peel them all for you.

470
00:42:30,757 --> 00:42:33,300
But the kimchi will be too bitter
if you put them all in.

471
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,594
The bigger the amount,
the tastier it will be.

472
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:42,351
I need some garlic too,
so let me take half.

473
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:46,063
Will the kimchi still be tasty?

474
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:47,356
Half is more than enough.

475
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:48,856
I see.

476
00:42:52,527 --> 00:42:54,739
Jinyowon is preparing for a wedding?

477
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:57,365
Do you remember how we placed

478
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:59,659
Young Lady Jin's wedding supplies
in the storage?

479
00:43:00,702 --> 00:43:03,456
Jinyowon asked for them back today.

480
00:43:06,541 --> 00:43:10,003
Someone must be getting married.

481
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:12,882
But if someone from the Jin family
is getting married,

482
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:15,342
it can only mean Young Lady Jin.

483
00:43:26,269 --> 00:43:28,146
The wedding date has been set already?

484
00:43:28,898 --> 00:43:30,525
This is too sudden, Mother.

485
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:33,443
It was not easy to find a suitor.

486
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:35,737
She must obey my words.

487
00:43:37,907 --> 00:43:38,907
Mother.

488
00:43:39,826 --> 00:43:41,202
Why are you so cruel?

489
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:45,206
As I expected,

490
00:43:46,706 --> 00:43:47,958
is she not Bu-yeon,

491
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:50,670
but that other woman?

492
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:52,088
Jin Cho-yeon.

493
00:43:55,173 --> 00:43:56,173
She is Bu-yeon.

494
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:58,469
The original soul was already dead

495
00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:01,472
when we retrieved the body
from the lake three years ago.

496
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:05,643
That body belongs to my daughter,
Jin Bu-yeon.

497
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:27,789
Bu-yeon.

498
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:32,210
Yes, Mother.

499
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:38,134
I am getting married?

500
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:42,889
Does that mean I will leave this room?

501
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:44,323
He will be married into the family.

502
00:44:44,347 --> 00:44:46,266
Once your husband arrives for the wedding,

503
00:44:46,349 --> 00:44:51,105
you will continue living in this room.

504
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:56,735
If I cannot get out of here,
why must I get married?

505
00:44:56,818 --> 00:44:59,739
Because we need a girl
who will lead Jinyowon in the future.

506
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:03,326
Children with the greatest divine powers

507
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:05,911
always come from the eldest daughters.

508
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:11,041
Give birth to a beautiful daughter
with great divine powers.

509
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:17,840
So you expect me to stay
locked up here and just give birth?

510
00:45:20,967 --> 00:45:21,967
No.

511
00:45:22,552 --> 00:45:24,054
I do not want that kind of marriage.

512
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:25,759
It has already been decided.

513
00:45:26,431 --> 00:45:27,791
You just need to follow my orders.

514
00:45:30,353 --> 00:45:32,646
If I get married like you want me to,

515
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:36,067
I will forever be stuck here.

516
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:39,610
Bu-yeon.

517
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:42,822
It took me many years to find you again.

518
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:47,244
Marry the man I have chosen for you

519
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:49,829
and stay by my side forever.

520
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:54,125
Mother.

521
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:57,463
Who will Bu-yeon

522
00:45:58,630 --> 00:45:59,465
get married to?

523
00:45:59,547 --> 00:46:01,884
He is from the Seo family
at Seoho Fortress.

524
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:04,387
He will temporarily stay
at Chwiseonru upon arrival.

525
00:46:04,469 --> 00:46:07,514
The wedding will take place
at his uncle's house.

526
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:12,394
He is excellent husband material.

527
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:45,594
We will arrive at Daeho Fortress soon.

528
00:46:46,219 --> 00:46:47,554
Has it been three years for you?

529
00:46:47,637 --> 00:46:48,637
Yes.

530
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:52,934
I did not know
it would take me this long to return.

531
00:46:53,893 --> 00:46:54,893
But Yul,

532
00:46:55,353 --> 00:46:59,692
why did Master Heo forbid you
from returning to Daeho Fortress?

533
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:02,152
I doubt you caused any kind of trouble.

534
00:47:02,235 --> 00:47:04,405
Did you have bad blood
with someone at Songrim?

535
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:06,949
He was protecting me.

536
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:11,161
And I was cowardly enough to listen.

537
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:19,003
Due to the ongoing drought,
the water level has dropped.

538
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:20,588
Its energy is weak now.

539
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:23,507
I heard they are planning
to perform a rite for the lake again.

540
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,594
The Unanimous Assembly
will be discussing it.

541
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:27,719
But to do that,

542
00:47:28,471 --> 00:47:31,931
they will need the help
of Jinyowon's priestesses.

543
00:47:38,563 --> 00:47:40,440
Jang Uk of Songrim

544
00:47:40,523 --> 00:47:43,402
caught and retrieved the soul
of the 29th soul shifter.

545
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:44,695
Then as usual,

546
00:47:46,072 --> 00:47:49,617
the Crown Prince shall visit him
and reward him with 1,000 gold <i><font color="white">nyang.</font></i>

547
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:53,079
Please allow Cheonbugwan

548
00:47:53,746 --> 00:47:56,498
to deliver them
instead of His Royal Highness from now on.

549
00:47:56,581 --> 00:47:58,041
I decline.

550
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:02,295
I ask that the Crown Prince
reward Uk himself as always.

551
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:16,889
Jang Uk has been earning
1,000 gold <i><font color="white">nyang</font></i> every time.

552
00:48:17,478 --> 00:48:19,980
At this rate, he will be
the richest man in Daeho.

553
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:23,025
If that is the price
for taking all the credit,

554
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:24,527
then you should do it happily.

555
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:28,030
The people of Daeho believe
you have ordered Jang Uk

556
00:48:28,114 --> 00:48:30,074
to kill all the monsters.

557
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:33,494
They praise you
for being born under the King's Star.

558
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:35,704
On the other hand,

559
00:48:35,788 --> 00:48:38,039
they call Uk a monster
who catches other monsters.

560
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:40,251
They are terrified and avoid him.

561
00:48:40,333 --> 00:48:41,960
He brought that upon himself.

562
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:45,965
Why is he carrying
Naksu's sword that once killed him?

563
00:48:46,047 --> 00:48:48,092
Some say he is bearing a bitter grudge,

564
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:51,219
while others say
he is just painfully in love with her.

565
00:48:54,639 --> 00:48:56,809
What do you think, Your Royal Highness?

566
00:48:56,891 --> 00:48:58,143
He is nothing but a lunatic.

567
00:48:58,226 --> 00:48:59,936
He chose to carry her sword

568
00:49:00,019 --> 00:49:02,273
and kill soul shifters
who are just like her.

569
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:03,648
He feels dark and ominous.

570
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:08,737
That is how people perceive him as of now.

571
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:11,364
Is that not what you wanted
in the first place?

572
00:49:19,706 --> 00:49:22,168
He is living the life you wanted for him.

573
00:49:22,251 --> 00:49:23,251
So please visit him,

574
00:49:23,793 --> 00:49:27,380
and praise and congratulate
that ominous lunatic yourself.

575
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:55,326
Visiting the now-empty Jeongjingak
always makes me forlorn.

576
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:58,077
Since every mage except Jang Uk has left,

577
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:01,206
the energy that fills this place
must be his own.

578
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:03,791
I heard it is
always dark and cold where he is.

579
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:16,179
I am here to reward you
for killing the soul shifter.

580
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:18,504
Thank you, Your Royal Highness.

581
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:20,141
You can leave it and go.

582
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:28,192
How dare he not accept it in person?

583
00:50:28,983 --> 00:50:30,318
Shall I call him back?

584
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:31,402
That is fine.

585
00:50:41,829 --> 00:50:44,666
I heard you followed
the soul shifter into Jinyowon.

586
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:48,420
How did you get in
when they forbade outsiders from entering?

587
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:51,382
No one can stop me from going anywhere.

588
00:50:52,257 --> 00:50:54,677
And I am used to feeling unwelcome.

589
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:00,391
Is that why you drink alone
in this dark and gloomy place?

590
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:06,771
Park Dang-go used to be
so affectionate toward you.

591
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:07,898
Then again,

592
00:51:08,731 --> 00:51:11,943
I do not blame him.
His wedding fell through because of you.

593
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:14,320
And Seo Yul is at Seoho Fortress.

594
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:17,574
I heard all the Jeongjingak mages left
because of you.

595
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:22,704
You are truly all alone.

596
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:34,465
I would rather be blunt
than sugarcoat things.

597
00:51:38,219 --> 00:51:40,722
Hey, why do you drink such strong liquor?

598
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:42,224
My insides are melting.

599
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:44,143
You should force yourself to have it.

600
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:47,813
The liquor will protect you
from the chill emitted by wraiths.

601
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:48,896
Wraiths?

602
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:52,650
But this is Jeongjingak.

603
00:51:53,943 --> 00:51:54,945
Did you not hear?

604
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:56,697
Wraiths follow me everywhere.

605
00:52:01,909 --> 00:52:02,909
What?

606
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:04,746
But it is broad daylight.

607
00:52:07,081 --> 00:52:07,916
That is absurd.

608
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,376
Feel free to leave
if you feel uncomfortable.

609
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,463
You must not have come here
because you missed me.

610
00:52:12,545 --> 00:52:16,300
Why do you ask me to reward you every time
if you know how uncomfortable I am?

611
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:18,217
You do not lack money.

612
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:22,097
It makes me feel at ease to use this power

613
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:25,351
only to atone for my sins and be rewarded.

614
00:52:25,434 --> 00:52:28,686
I take credit for punishing
and rewarding you.

615
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:31,648
I must look like a joke to you.

616
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:37,987
This is what I dislike about you.

617
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:41,115
You look down on me and mock me
for the things I desire and obsess over.

618
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:42,409
That is what offends me.

619
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:44,119
And you should be.

620
00:52:45,746 --> 00:52:47,539
That is exactly why I am doing this.

621
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,773
I am too intimidating
to be considered acting out of stupidity.

622
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:58,592
Yet your ego does not let you accept
that I am acting out of vigor.

623
00:52:59,842 --> 00:53:01,427
I am sure it bothers you.

624
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:08,976
You are right.

625
00:53:10,436 --> 00:53:12,981
You are always as annoying
as a splinter in my finger.

626
00:53:13,065 --> 00:53:14,858
A splinter in your finger?

627
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:17,820
What a joke.

628
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:21,782
Did Jin Mu tell you

629
00:53:22,865 --> 00:53:24,867
to think that of me
to make you feel better?

630
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:31,373
Am I not too strong

631
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:34,931
and too significant to be a mere splinter?

632
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:42,344
I understand that you are frustrated,
but you are not the victim here.

633
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:45,389
That splinter cannot be

634
00:53:46,764 --> 00:53:47,764
more painful

635
00:53:48,641 --> 00:53:50,518
than a sword through my chest.

636
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:07,327
Well, then.

637
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:09,491
We will meet again
once I kill the next soul shifter.

638
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:27,139
Bu-yeon disappeared?

639
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:28,764
Look at this, my lady.

640
00:54:29,974 --> 00:54:31,309
She must have climbed using this

641
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:33,228
and escaped through the window.

642
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:36,356
Why are these on the wall?

643
00:54:37,356 --> 00:54:39,150
How in the world did she do that?

644
00:54:39,233 --> 00:54:40,233
I am not sure.

645
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:45,114
We must find her before Mother finds out.

646
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:47,784
She has the tracking bracelet.

647
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:50,329
It may take some time,
but we will eventually find her.

648
00:55:07,221 --> 00:55:09,597
<i><font color="white">Last time, they caught me in four hours.</font></i>

649
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:11,432
<i><font color="white">I must meet my betrothed before then.</font></i>

650
00:55:12,099 --> 00:55:14,436
He is from the Seo family
at Seoho Fortress.

651
00:55:15,269 --> 00:55:17,313
He will temporarily stay
at Chwiseonru upon arrival.

652
00:55:17,396 --> 00:55:18,481
Chwiseonru.

653
00:55:22,693 --> 00:55:26,364
A man from the Seo family
who will come from Seoho Fortress?

654
00:55:26,447 --> 00:55:27,574
That is right.

655
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:29,576
I heard he will be staying there.

656
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:32,286
Yes. We do have reservations.

657
00:55:32,371 --> 00:55:35,831
There are two of them.
Which one of them are you looking for?

658
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:42,713
A man who is excellent husband material.

659
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:44,757
I see.

660
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,802
Then it must be Young Master Seo Yul.

661
00:55:47,385 --> 00:55:48,512
Seo Yul?

662
00:55:48,594 --> 00:55:50,847
Have you never heard of him?

663
00:55:52,306 --> 00:55:54,184
You must not be from Daeho Fortress.

664
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:57,478
Every woman here knows about him.

665
00:55:59,565 --> 00:56:02,233
I cannot reveal
a guest's information to a stranger.

666
00:56:09,365 --> 00:56:10,826
Can you tell me more in detail?

667
00:56:17,666 --> 00:56:19,458
Check if this is authentic or not.

668
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:21,253
Yes, my lady.

669
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:24,213
There are four men

670
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:27,592
at Daeho Fortress
whom all the women want to marry.

671
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:28,675
First.

672
00:56:29,385 --> 00:56:31,762
<i><font color="white">The prince who will sit
on the throne one day.</font></i>

673
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:36,309
<i><font color="white">Crown Prince Go Won.</font></i>

674
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:39,855
<i><font color="white">He is single,
but not everyone can marry him.</font></i>

675
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:44,525
<i><font color="white">The next candidate
is from the wealthiest family here.</font></i>

676
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:46,945
<i><font color="white">He is the new leader of Songrim,
Park Dang-go.</font></i>

677
00:56:48,447 --> 00:56:51,032
<i><font color="white">His wedding fell through
at the very last minute.</font></i>

678
00:56:51,115 --> 00:56:52,451
<i><font color="white">But that is not a big deal.</font></i>

679
00:56:53,284 --> 00:56:55,746
<i><font color="white">The third candidate is Seo Yul.</font></i>

680
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:01,126
<i><font color="white">He is from the most distinguished family
and lacks nothing.</font></i>

681
00:57:01,208 --> 00:57:03,836
<i><font color="white">But the catch is that
his hometown is Seoho Fortress.</font></i>

682
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,005
<i><font color="white">It is too far away.</font></i>

683
00:57:06,088 --> 00:57:09,009
<i><font color="white">And lastly, there is Jang Uk.</font></i>

684
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:13,512
<i><font color="white">He is probably
the strongest man in the world right now.</font></i>

685
00:57:13,597 --> 00:57:16,266
<i><font color="white">But I do not recommend him.</font></i>

686
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:17,349
<i><font color="white">Why not?</font></i>

687
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:22,021
<i><font color="white">You should never date a man with a past
as painful as a stab to the heart.</font></i>

688
00:57:25,943 --> 00:57:29,528
So among those men,
you are here to meet Seo Yul, right?

689
00:57:30,322 --> 00:57:31,989
I believe so.

690
00:57:32,074 --> 00:57:33,659
When is he coming?

691
00:57:33,742 --> 00:57:36,102
The boat that departed
from Seoho Fortress will arrive soon.

692
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:37,371
He should be here shortly.

693
00:57:38,704 --> 00:57:40,916
By the way,
what is your relationship with him?

694
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:44,795
You talked about him being a husband.
Are you his betrothed?

695
00:57:46,672 --> 00:57:48,215
I will only make that decision

696
00:57:48,297 --> 00:57:51,550
after we meet and discuss the matter.

697
00:57:51,635 --> 00:57:54,471
Goodness, you are confident.

698
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:57,974
He is not someone you can have
solely based on good looks.

699
00:57:58,057 --> 00:58:00,268
Which family are you from?

700
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:04,146
Madam.

701
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:12,197
It is indeed authentic,

702
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,282
but this is the crest of Jinyowon.

703
00:58:14,365 --> 00:58:16,827
She is offering something from Jinyowon?

704
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:18,911
She must be a thief.

705
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:24,166
My lady.

706
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:26,460
What is your relationship with Jinyowon?

707
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:29,965
How suspicious.

708
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:33,467
I must go there
and check if this is really yours.

709
00:58:35,219 --> 00:58:37,264
Get her! Get that thief!

710
00:58:40,057 --> 00:58:41,057
Hello, my lord.

711
00:58:41,101 --> 00:58:43,686
- Is Yul here?
- He has not arrived yet.

712
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:06,501
He will be arriving on a boat.

713
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:09,210
Probably from over there.

714
00:59:11,465 --> 00:59:13,215
If he lacks nothing,

715
00:59:14,009 --> 00:59:15,802
he must be handsome too.

716
00:59:22,768 --> 00:59:25,103
Excuse me. Are you from the Seo family?

717
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:27,438
No, I am not.

718
00:59:27,521 --> 00:59:28,916
But I would like to know your name.

719
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,317
Forget it, then.

720
00:59:52,588 --> 00:59:55,842
This boat will depart
for Bisan-dong in the capital.

721
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:58,887
This boat will depart
for Bisan-dong in the capital.

722
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:25,496
Have you been well,

723
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:28,375
Young Master Seo?

724
01:00:38,175 --> 01:00:40,512
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

725
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:47,643
<i><font color="white">If my betrothed accepts
my mother's wishes,</font></i>

726
01:00:47,726 --> 01:00:49,646
<i><font color="white">I will be locked up there forever.</font></i>

727
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:54,067
<i><font color="white">I must speak with him before I get caught.</font></i>

728
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:56,860
<i><font color="white">What should I do?</font></i>

729
01:01:05,452 --> 01:01:07,706
Look over there.

730
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:10,208
Is he not Jang Uk?

731
01:01:10,291 --> 01:01:12,210
Yes, the ice stone man.

732
01:01:12,293 --> 01:01:14,295
He is Young Master Jang
from the Jang family.

733
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:30,269
Is that man over there Jang Uk?

734
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:31,855
- Yes, he is.
- Yes.

735
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:32,938
Jang Uk.

736
01:01:35,483 --> 01:01:36,483
The fourth candidate.

737
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:49,914
<i><font color="white">He is probably
the strongest man in the world right now.</font></i>

738
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:52,333
<i><font color="white">The strongest man?</font></i>

739
01:02:21,028 --> 01:02:22,947
I heard that people avoid you.

740
01:02:24,074 --> 01:02:25,367
So it is true.

741
01:02:26,034 --> 01:02:27,434
You must have successfully escaped.

742
01:02:27,952 --> 01:02:29,829
Right. You said it was just an outing.

743
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:32,666
Yes, thanks to you.

744
01:02:37,503 --> 01:02:39,172
I smell something delicious.

745
01:02:44,344 --> 01:02:45,679
Can I have one of those?

746
01:02:50,641 --> 01:02:52,601
Never mind. I have no money.

747
01:02:54,478 --> 01:02:56,356
Here is your strong liquor, my lord.

748
01:02:58,023 --> 01:02:59,023
Excuse me.

749
01:03:02,027 --> 01:03:03,362
I want one of those.

750
01:03:04,072 --> 01:03:05,072
Yes, my lord.

751
01:03:08,994 --> 01:03:10,911
Thanks, Jang Uk.

752
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:14,331
How do you know my name?

753
01:03:14,416 --> 01:03:16,041
I learned it by accident

754
01:03:16,126 --> 01:03:18,168
while searching for my betrothed.

755
01:03:19,253 --> 01:03:20,088
Betrothed?

756
01:03:20,170 --> 01:03:22,047
I will get married soon.

757
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:24,384
He will move into Jinyowon.

758
01:03:26,552 --> 01:03:28,405
Even regular priestesses' husbands
move in there?

759
01:03:28,429 --> 01:03:29,806
Of course not.

760
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:32,224
Only the heir of the Jin family
brings in her husband.

761
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:34,143
But that is Jin Cho-yeon.

762
01:03:34,768 --> 01:03:36,855
She is the second daughter.

763
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:40,733
The future leader of Jinyowon

764
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:42,318
will be me, the eldest daughter.

765
01:03:43,235 --> 01:03:44,235
Jin Bu-yeon.

766
01:03:48,032 --> 01:03:50,201
What? You are who?

767
01:03:52,661 --> 01:03:54,079
She died ages ago.

768
01:03:54,164 --> 01:03:57,791
I told you already
that I died a long time ago.

769
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:02,963
I was locked up there
because I should not have existed

770
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:04,590
in the first place.

771
01:04:06,925 --> 01:04:09,471
My mother wants my future husband
to secretly move in.

772
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:11,306
She wants me to give birth to an heir.

773
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:15,643
But if I do get married,
I will be stuck in that room forever.

774
01:04:15,726 --> 01:04:18,271
So you are Jin Bu-yeon.

775
01:04:18,355 --> 01:04:20,523
And you want to run away
and not get married?

776
01:04:22,483 --> 01:04:24,277
I cannot flee.

777
01:04:24,777 --> 01:04:27,322
So I wanted to find my betrothed
and ask for his help.

778
01:04:29,824 --> 01:04:31,784
But I just came up with a great idea.

779
01:04:34,454 --> 01:04:37,916
I should find a husband
who suits me instead.

780
01:04:41,001 --> 01:04:42,170
Speaking of which,

781
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:44,420
Jang Uk.

782
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:47,759
Will you marry me?

783
01:04:48,967 --> 01:04:49,802
What?

784
01:04:49,885 --> 01:04:53,181
I want you to be my husband.

785
01:05:04,775 --> 01:05:07,945
There are no mages
who train at Jeongjingak anymore.

786
01:05:10,364 --> 01:05:11,364
There is only Uk.

787
01:05:12,199 --> 01:05:13,952
But he was the reason

788
01:05:14,702 --> 01:05:15,702
why everyone left.

789
01:05:19,123 --> 01:05:20,416
I left first.

790
01:05:23,378 --> 01:05:24,795
I fled by myself

791
01:05:26,463 --> 01:05:28,298
when you two were struggling the most.

792
01:05:33,054 --> 01:05:34,054
I am sorry.

793
01:05:38,934 --> 01:05:40,103
You were struggling too.

794
01:05:43,648 --> 01:05:44,648
You knew,

795
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:47,193
did you not?

796
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:50,655
That she was Naksu.

797
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:55,659
Yes.

798
01:05:56,077 --> 01:05:58,788
Uk was the first to recognize her.

799
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:03,418
But I was the first to meet Naksu.

800
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:20,893
We only met once,
but you want me to marry you?

801
01:06:21,686 --> 01:06:23,271
You must be out of your mind.

802
01:06:23,353 --> 01:06:27,275
- I should have never helped you escape.
- I am not out of my mind.

803
01:06:27,858 --> 01:06:30,027
You are strong enough
to go against my mother.

804
01:06:30,110 --> 01:06:32,112
And you have bad blood with Jinyowon.

805
01:06:32,197 --> 01:06:34,574
If we get married, she might kick me out.

806
01:06:35,449 --> 01:06:36,992
That is exactly what I want.

807
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:42,414
I cannot believe I ran into
the perfect potential husband.

808
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:50,398
I cannot believe I ran into
the craziest potential bride

809
01:06:50,422 --> 01:06:51,673
when we only met once.

810
01:06:52,382 --> 01:06:54,219
- So you see me as a potential bride?
- No.

811
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:57,012
Look me in the eye.

812
01:06:58,639 --> 01:07:00,141
Look at me and reconsider.

813
01:07:04,978 --> 01:07:07,190
Do you not want to wed me?

814
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:08,190
Why?

815
01:07:08,273 --> 01:07:09,273
Becauseâ€¦

816
01:07:12,737 --> 01:07:13,780
my beauty is unmatched.

817
01:07:17,659 --> 01:07:18,826
You are driving me crazy.

818
01:07:19,619 --> 01:07:20,744
You cannot deny the fact

819
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:24,581
that I turn heads wherever I go.

820
01:07:28,126 --> 01:07:30,128
I am sure you can see for yourself.

821
01:07:30,213 --> 01:07:31,213
Yes, you are beautiful.

822
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:35,342
I hope you find a better match
with that beauty of yours.

823
01:07:37,262 --> 01:07:38,679
Enjoy the chicken.

824
01:07:38,762 --> 01:07:39,764
Jang Uk.

825
01:07:44,018 --> 01:07:45,018
You.

826
01:07:45,853 --> 01:07:47,563
Do you think I am a pushover?

827
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:49,690
That is enough.

828
01:07:59,032 --> 01:08:00,284
That looks good.

829
01:08:00,367 --> 01:08:02,911
Enjoy your outing and go home.

830
01:08:19,511 --> 01:08:21,221
Darn it. They will catch me soon.

831
01:09:05,432 --> 01:09:06,850
There is one thing that bothers me.

832
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:10,979
Seeing how they are
determined to find you,

833
01:09:11,898 --> 01:09:13,815
you must not be just some lousy priestess.

834
01:09:13,899 --> 01:09:16,735
Are you really Jin Bu-yeon?

835
01:09:17,444 --> 01:09:19,822
Yes. I am her.

836
01:09:19,905 --> 01:09:21,282
She went missing ages ago.

837
01:09:21,365 --> 01:09:23,659
But they found me three years ago.

838
01:09:23,743 --> 01:09:25,869
They also found a fake daughter back then.

839
01:09:25,953 --> 01:09:29,414
If I were fake, why would they hide me
for all those years?

840
01:09:30,248 --> 01:09:31,542
I am the real Bu-yeon.

841
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:35,003
Then again, I did hear

842
01:09:36,088 --> 01:09:38,173
that Bu-yeon could see energy.

843
01:09:40,301 --> 01:09:43,387
And you saw the ice stone within me.

844
01:09:44,096 --> 01:09:45,264
That is right.

845
01:09:45,347 --> 01:09:47,891
I am the eldest daughter
with the greatest divine powers.

846
01:09:48,850 --> 01:09:50,435
If my looks do not move you,

847
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:51,561
consider my skills.

848
01:09:52,270 --> 01:09:54,064
You might need my help one day.

849
01:09:58,319 --> 01:09:59,319
All right.

850
01:10:00,445 --> 01:10:02,155
If I ever need your help,

851
01:10:03,365 --> 01:10:04,365
I will find you then.

852
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:12,142
I will get married
on the full moon of this month.

853
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:15,002
And once I do,
I will never be able to leave that room.

854
01:10:16,546 --> 01:10:18,506
I need a new groom to avoid that fate.

855
01:10:21,926 --> 01:10:24,845
I would like you to come and take me away.

856
01:10:26,389 --> 01:10:27,389
I will be waiting.

857
01:10:28,515 --> 01:10:30,560
Please come for me.

858
01:10:43,155 --> 01:10:44,155
Jang Uk.

859
01:10:45,032 --> 01:10:48,327
Everyone seems to avoid you.

860
01:10:49,287 --> 01:10:51,122
Just get married while you still can.

861
01:10:52,289 --> 01:10:53,666
I am willing to marry you.

862
01:10:56,418 --> 01:10:57,418
Forget it.

863
01:11:07,512 --> 01:11:08,847
There you are.

864
01:11:08,930 --> 01:11:10,140
Let us go.

865
01:11:21,027 --> 01:11:22,528
Have you been well, my lord?

866
01:11:22,612 --> 01:11:24,822
I am no longer the leader of Songrim.

867
01:11:25,698 --> 01:11:27,158
Dang-go is the leader now.

868
01:11:27,949 --> 01:11:29,076
Come on.

869
01:11:29,159 --> 01:11:30,243
Uncle.

870
01:11:30,328 --> 01:11:32,622
I feel uneasy
whenever someone calls me that.

871
01:11:32,704 --> 01:11:34,623
Can you take the position again

872
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:36,501
and let me just assist you?

873
01:11:36,583 --> 01:11:37,627
Forget it.

874
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:40,587
I have become so carefree.

875
01:11:43,423 --> 01:11:44,801
What do you do these days?

876
01:11:44,884 --> 01:11:48,554
I farm and do housework.

877
01:11:50,055 --> 01:11:51,055
Yul,

878
01:11:51,681 --> 01:11:56,354
I have prepared a grand feast
just for you.

879
01:11:57,729 --> 01:12:00,358
Did you do the cooking, Uncle?

880
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:02,025
He should have a taste too.

881
01:12:02,859 --> 01:12:04,487
Yul, you can look forward to it.

882
01:12:15,206 --> 01:12:17,917
He is right. I cannot be the only victim.

883
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,086
You should have a taste as well.

884
01:12:22,796 --> 01:12:24,631
Here comes another victim.

885
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:38,353
You are back.

886
01:12:43,024 --> 01:12:44,484
Yes, I am back.

887
01:13:15,307 --> 01:13:18,435
I dug out this <i><font color="white">deodeok</font></i> myself,
added a bit of red pepper paste,

888
01:13:18,519 --> 01:13:21,104
and charbroiled it.

889
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:23,356
Is it not fragrant?

890
01:13:26,735 --> 01:13:27,944
This was <i><font color="white">deodeok?</font></i>

891
01:13:30,948 --> 01:13:31,948
I did not know.

892
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:37,203
Yul must have a dull palate.

893
01:13:37,997 --> 01:13:40,207
Right? Try savoring it.

894
01:13:45,212 --> 01:13:46,338
It has a strange smell.

895
01:13:50,635 --> 01:13:52,929
I truly appreciate your thoughtfulness.

896
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:55,472
But I cannot eat this anymore.

897
01:13:57,557 --> 01:13:59,894
I understand.

898
01:13:59,976 --> 01:14:02,520
It may not be to your liking.

899
01:14:02,604 --> 01:14:03,604
- Right.
- Right.

900
01:14:04,230 --> 01:14:06,859
Dang-go and Uk can have the rest.

901
01:14:21,748 --> 01:14:24,292
I am delighted to see you three

902
01:14:24,377 --> 01:14:25,877
sitting before me once again.

903
01:14:27,587 --> 01:14:28,587
Cheers.

904
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:41,394
- Eat up.
- Eat up.

905
01:14:46,564 --> 01:14:48,149
Park Dang-go of Songrim is aware

906
01:14:48,234 --> 01:14:50,528
that we are preparing for a wedding?

907
01:14:51,112 --> 01:14:52,113
Yes, my lady.

908
01:14:52,195 --> 01:14:54,823
I heard that he kept asking
who the bride was.

909
01:14:58,703 --> 01:15:00,453
Since he does not know about Bu-yeon,

910
01:15:01,037 --> 01:15:02,914
we should tell him it is me.

911
01:15:10,338 --> 01:15:12,925
I loved you, Jin Cho-yeon.

912
01:15:15,176 --> 01:15:17,430
I hope you will be happy!

913
01:15:19,015 --> 01:15:23,101
I miss you so muchâ€¦

914
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:26,021
I will tuck him in.

915
01:15:26,104 --> 01:15:27,104
- Sure.
- Jin Cho-yeonâ€¦

916
01:15:27,939 --> 01:15:30,400
- I loved you, Jin Cho-yeon.
- Bye.

917
01:15:31,694 --> 01:15:34,904
I loved you so muchâ€¦

918
01:15:34,988 --> 01:15:36,198
That poor kid.

919
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:38,743
Seeing how drunk he is,

920
01:15:39,993 --> 01:15:43,329
Sang-ho must have been right
about a wedding happening in Jinyowon.

921
01:15:47,167 --> 01:15:50,128
There really is a wedding
taking place in Jinyowon?

922
01:15:50,712 --> 01:15:52,881
I heard they brought in wedding supplies.

923
01:15:53,923 --> 01:15:56,719
They locked their gate
and lay low for the past three years.

924
01:15:57,886 --> 01:16:01,140
I guess the wedding
will be held in secret as well.

925
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:06,979
Do you know who the bride is?

926
01:16:07,063 --> 01:16:08,229
Jin Cho-yeon, probably.

927
01:16:09,314 --> 01:16:12,234
She is the only daughter of the family.

928
01:16:13,735 --> 01:16:15,404
There is also the eldest daughter.

929
01:16:15,488 --> 01:16:17,530
But she is dead.

930
01:16:18,114 --> 01:16:21,534
She was trying to retrieve
the ice stone that was sealed in the lake

931
01:16:21,618 --> 01:16:23,287
when the waters swept her away.

932
01:16:23,369 --> 01:16:24,788
Her father came clean

933
01:16:25,997 --> 01:16:27,707
about everything before he died.

934
01:16:29,376 --> 01:16:31,796
Her death was such a waste.

935
01:16:32,378 --> 01:16:35,173
With the divine powers
she had at such a young age,

936
01:16:36,341 --> 01:16:39,011
she would have grown to be
as powerful as Jin Seol-ran,

937
01:16:39,511 --> 01:16:41,055
the first leader of Jinyowon.

938
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:44,849
If a priestess

939
01:16:46,143 --> 01:16:47,936
as powerful as Jin Seol-ran exists,

940
01:16:49,939 --> 01:16:52,315
will she be able
to extract the ice stone within me?

941
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:54,652
If she can,

942
01:16:55,694 --> 01:16:56,945
would you extract it?

943
01:17:03,202 --> 01:17:06,872
You are only alive thanks to that stone.

944
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:08,457
You said the ice stone

945
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:12,086
should be destroyed
since no human can control its power.

946
01:17:13,587 --> 01:17:14,587
Yes.

947
01:17:15,463 --> 01:17:16,465
You are right.

948
01:17:18,134 --> 01:17:19,135
It is too much for meâ€¦

949
01:17:21,386 --> 01:17:22,386
to handle.

950
01:17:27,893 --> 01:17:29,228
Maidservant Kim told me

951
01:17:30,770 --> 01:17:33,899
that it was too painful to watch you live

952
01:17:33,983 --> 01:17:35,984
with a wounded heart.

953
01:17:37,610 --> 01:17:38,945
Is it still very painful?

954
01:17:41,489 --> 01:17:42,867
I should have died then.

955
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:45,161
As a human,

956
01:17:46,537 --> 01:17:48,706
I should have died then and there.

957
01:17:49,289 --> 01:17:51,041
Do you think removing the ice stone

958
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:55,296
would heal your wounded heart?

959
01:18:01,467 --> 01:18:04,345
But if you do that,

960
01:18:05,972 --> 01:18:06,972
you will die.

961
01:18:10,769 --> 01:18:11,769
At leastâ€¦

962
01:18:14,814 --> 01:18:17,693
I will lift the weight off my shoulders
and finally be at peace.

963
01:19:26,761 --> 01:19:27,762
Uncle Yun-o,

964
01:19:27,845 --> 01:19:29,014
you are getting married?

965
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:31,891
You never told me.

966
01:19:33,018 --> 01:19:36,063
It was meant to be a secret,
so I could not tell you.

967
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:41,484
I will be wedding the eldest daughter
of Jinyowon, Jin Bu-yeon.

968
01:19:49,368 --> 01:19:52,246
It is our tradition to have
the wedding at the groom's place

969
01:19:52,997 --> 01:19:55,039
and then return to Jinyowon with him.

970
01:20:03,923 --> 01:20:04,923
What is that?

971
01:20:05,926 --> 01:20:07,261
A petal?

972
01:20:08,177 --> 01:20:10,221
It came to me
when I was at my most desperate.

973
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:14,350
I hope it will return.

974
01:20:17,229 --> 01:20:21,024
I know you hate it,
but you should not run away again.

975
01:20:22,984 --> 01:20:23,984
I know.

976
01:20:24,737 --> 01:20:25,738
I am waiting.

977
01:20:26,404 --> 01:20:28,823
Waiting? For whom?

978
01:20:31,327 --> 01:20:32,453
My groom.

979
01:20:35,497 --> 01:20:38,417
<i><font color="white">Please come and take me away.</font></i>

980
01:21:05,652 --> 01:21:07,654
The bride has left Jinyowon

981
01:21:08,363 --> 01:21:09,448
and will be here soon.

982
01:21:11,949 --> 01:21:14,828
Is he the one Bu-yeon will wed tonight?

983
01:21:14,912 --> 01:21:15,912
Yes.

984
01:21:16,246 --> 01:21:18,457
He is the cousin
of General Seo of Seoho Fortress

985
01:21:18,539 --> 01:21:19,541
and the Queen.

986
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:21,335
He lost his parents early

987
01:21:21,417 --> 01:21:23,295
and has no one to rely on.

988
01:21:24,630 --> 01:21:26,590
He needs our help,

989
01:21:27,382 --> 01:21:29,717
so I can be assured that he will do well.

990
01:21:34,014 --> 01:21:35,014
<i><font color="white">He will not be able</font></i>

991
01:21:35,890 --> 01:21:38,268
<i><font color="white">to free my sister.</font></i>

992
01:21:55,702 --> 01:21:57,078
I guess he will not come.

993
01:23:34,510 --> 01:23:35,510
I knew it.

994
01:23:36,177 --> 01:23:37,386
I knew you would come.

995
01:23:38,555 --> 01:23:39,972
You might be of some use.

996
01:23:40,556 --> 01:23:42,184
I told you I would be useful.

997
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:50,274
Let us go.

998
01:23:50,359 --> 01:23:51,359
Sure.

999
01:23:55,948 --> 01:23:57,949
Let us go, my dear husband.

1000
01:25:04,390 --> 01:25:07,310
ALCHEMY OF SOULS
PART 2

1001
01:25:07,394 --> 01:25:10,271
You see, I remember nothing
before Jinyowon.

1002
01:25:11,148 --> 01:25:13,274
Search all of Songrim
and find Park Dang-go.

1003
01:25:13,358 --> 01:25:15,569
I thought the wedding ceremony
was for Young Lady Jin.

1004
01:25:15,652 --> 01:25:19,197
<i><font color="white">Although I wanted to ruin the ceremony,
I did not.</font></i>

1005
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:20,114
WHOEVER FINDS THIS LADY
WILL BE REWARDED GENEROUSLY

1006
01:25:20,198 --> 01:25:22,826
The entire world ended up
finding out about Bu-yeon.

1007
01:25:23,368 --> 01:25:26,329
Were you going to ask her
to take out the ice stone for you?

1008
01:25:27,122 --> 01:25:30,000
<i><font color="white">Have we ever met before?</font></i>

1009
01:25:30,958 --> 01:25:33,753
<i><font color="white">What is it that you need me for?</font></i>

1010
01:25:34,253 --> 01:25:37,341
<i><font color="white">I just need your great divine powers.
That is why I need you.</font></i>

1011
01:25:37,923 --> 01:25:42,679
