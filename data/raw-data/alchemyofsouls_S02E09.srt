00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:44,958
ALCHEMY OF SOULS PART 2

2
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:46,837
You…

3
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:48,382
Who are you?

4
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:49,795
I am exactly what you see.

5
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:53,302
I am a soul shifter

6
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,300
with blue marks in my eyes.

7
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:56,770
What?

8
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:59,098
When the blue marks
happened to reappear,

9
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:02,347
I remembered who I was.

10
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:07,192
I am not Jin Bu-yeon.

11
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:10,864
My soul…

12
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:14,453
belongs to someone else.

13
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:16,488
Someone else?

14
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,786
I ran away because I did
not want to get caught.

15
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:22,504
But here we are.

16
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:27,673
What will you do now?

17
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:30,464
Jang Uk.

18
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:37,636
Did you find her?

19
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:39,808
Yes, I did. She is safe with me.

20
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:42,101
Is she hurt? Are you all right?

21
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,225
She was just startled
by the wraiths.

22
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:45,612
She is calming herself down.

23
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:47,403
Do not worry.

24
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,362
Is that so? There are wraiths?

25
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,652
Come to think of it, this
is one dreary forest.

26
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,955
The marks are only
detectable from this close.

27
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:10,207
I will decide what
to do with you.

28
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,089
No one else should know.

29
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:13,632
Keep it in mind.

30
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,337
Only I am allowed

31
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:17,928
to come this close.

32
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,224
Fine.

33
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:26,099
Only you are allowed…

34
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:29,022
to come this close.

35
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,240
Are you saying Naksu
realized who she truly was?

36
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:38,994
I believe so.

37
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:43,245
Now that Naksu has regained her
memory, will her soul leave the body?

38
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:46,249
Will the body be
Bu-yeon's entirely?

39
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,503
Seo Yul told me.

40
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,960
I will not blame you for
deceiving me, so please tell me.

41
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:54,878
If Naksu's soul leaves the body

42
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:57,756
and she becomes Bu-yeon
again while she is in Gwido,

43
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,974
will she be able to
come out of there alive?

44
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:02,854
She will be fine.

45
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,232
Bu-yeon's soul
has immense powers

46
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,810
that even I fail to fathom.

47
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,798
The one who attacked me earlier
was the wraith of this corpse.

48
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,992
Unlike the other
wraiths that avoided me,

49
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:22,663
this one chased me.

50
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,164
What is that blue object?

51
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,297
This is an ice stone.

52
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:36,089
An ice stone? I did not know
there was one in Gwido too.

53
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,844
That ice stone has
no energy of the sky.

54
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,387
It is different from Uk's.

55
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,350
It desires to
absorb human energy

56
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:45,181
like a soul shifter
that has run wild.

57
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,726
It is best that we let it be.

58
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,810
Someone with an ice
stone who died here…

59
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,357
This body must belong to
that mage of the Choi family.

60
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:57,492
That mage held deep resentment
toward Jin Seol-ran.

61
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,210
You were likely attacked as it
sensed that you were her descendant.

62
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:01,487
It seems so.

63
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:05,334
The wraith must have noticed that
this body belongs to the Jin family.

64
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,211
Hold on.

65
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,588
- How did you two find me?
- I thought you summoned us.

66
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:13,669
What do you mean?

67
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:15,797
- I summoned you?
- Yes.

68
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,550
I went to tell Jang Uk about
this after you had entered Gwido.

69
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,803
You summoned us here, so
we came to your rescue.

70
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:23,255
After you and Jin Mu
agreed to throw me in here,

71
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,346
you came to rescue me?

72
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,992
Does that mean you went all
the way to North Fortress

73
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,476
to tell him about me?

74
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,103
I was never

75
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:33,343
at North Fortress to begin with.

76
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,111
I never sided with
Jin Mu either.

77
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,451
I am on his side.

78
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,945
You do not need
to come so close.

79
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:45,951
Stay still.

80
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,963
I offered to join hands first

81
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:50,288
since I am the Crown Prince.

82
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,133
I will hide behind
Jin Mu like you said,

83
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:57,762
and I order you to go far away.

84
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:00,969
It sounds like

85
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,970
you and Jin Mu can only begin
your scheme once I leave.

86
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,053
That is right.

87
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,350
I will remain here and uncover
those behind his power.

88
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,774
His secret organization?

89
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:13,692
He has made countless soul
shifters with the Soul Ejector,

90
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,521
and they are still aiding him.

91
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:18,897
I do not know how many there
are or their identities.

92
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:23,605
But I know that they need the ice stone
to prevent themselves from running wild.

93
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,658
We need to wipe out his
entire secret organization

94
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,739
if we want to stop him.

95
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,827
And you are the only one
who can do just that.

96
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,248
Are you saying

97
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,628
that you want to
join hands with me?

98
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,919
Tell them you will
go to North Fortress.

99
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,888
Then return immediately.

100
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:46,138
Meanwhile, I will gather
all the soul shifters

101
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,640
in one place so you
can annihilate them.

102
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:53,811
You could gain great power
if you side with Jin Mu.

103
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:57,114
So why have you decided
to go against him?

104
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,450
He got rid of my turtle.

105
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:08,123
Your turtle?

106
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,621
I am not going to add a grand
pretext for my decision,

107
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,463
such as wanting
to save the world.

108
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,538
The moment he got
rid of my turtle,

109
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,629
I decided to
abandon him as well.

110
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,216
What is it?

111
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,096
Is my trivial reason
too unbelievable?

112
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:30,348
You have decided to go against
him because of a single turtle.

113
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,811
That sounds more believable
than a grand justification.

114
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:37,186
So did you find your turtle?

115
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,031
It is nowhere to be found.

116
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,613
It is a smart turtle,

117
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:48,617
so it should be able
to find its way back.

118
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:52,158
It may have died.

119
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,094
Jang Uk of the Jang family

120
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,888
will be appointed as the
general of North Fortress.

121
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:14,352
No one will know that you did
not leave for the time being.

122
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,191
I have sent one of my
men to get on that boat.

123
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:21,400
So no one will know that you are missing
until the boat arrives at its destination.

124
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:25,235
Stay here and wait for
Jin Mu to make his move.

125
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:28,105
Dang-gu and Yul will
take turns and stop by.

126
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:31,367
Could you not have found a
cleaner place for me to stay in?

127
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,331
Look at this place.

128
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,500
- There are so many spiderwebs.
- My goodness.

129
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:38,918
He does not seem to
like this place either.

130
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,603
- There are still spiderwebs here.
- Please be careful, Your Royal Highness.

131
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,127
How am I to go through them?

132
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:44,553
Goodness.

133
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:48,130
I thought you did not like how he
was slowly crawling toward you.

134
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,404
But I guess you
opened your heart.

135
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:53,098
He did not want us to be hostile
toward each other anymore.

136
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:56,311
So I told him to stop
bugging me and to step aside.

137
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,018
Goodness.

138
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:07,066
I want Songrim to give
full support to Jang Uk.

139
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:09,404
As for me,

140
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:11,447
I will hide and make way for us.

141
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,515
Bring them in with the gifts for the
King that get imported from the volcano.

142
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:22,709
Jin Mu's items will be brought in
alongside the gifts for the King.

143
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:24,713
Do not inspect them
and just let them in.

144
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,190
- Yes, my lord.
- We need to place them

145
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,974
throughout the canals
before the rite.

146
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,340
Will you allow me to do
that, Your Royal Highness?

147
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:34,387
I will inform the men of the Night
Watch who guard the city at night.

148
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,472
You may use them.

149
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:39,018
These are the areas where the
Night Watch placed the earthenware.

150
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:42,401
We can retrieve the earthenware
from those places later.

151
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:45,114
The earthenware will
help the fire bird

152
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,531
become stronger once it awakens.

153
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,534
It is similar to
adding fuel to a fire.

154
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:55,161
Once the Unanimous Assembly begins,
Jin Mu will go for Jinyowon.

155
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,493
And I will help him.

156
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:59,827
Once he gains Jinyowon, he will
try to bring out the fire bird.

157
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:03,254
His secret organization will get
to work within the next few days.

158
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,460
Is Bu-yeon staying in
Jinyowon right now?

159
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,676
Does she know that you are here?

160
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:12,512
No, I did not tell her.

161
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,394
I see.

162
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:17,430
If she finds out that you left
for North Fortress without her,

163
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:19,392
she will be hurt.

164
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:21,935
Right.

165
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:29,113
You did not tell the shaman?

166
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,860
Why not?

167
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,949
She is not a shaman, Eunuch Go.

168
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,030
Did you two fight?

169
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,913
That was why you
could not tell her.

170
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,123
Goodness.

171
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:39,953
Why?

172
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,118
Why did you argue?

173
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:44,165
She told me a few things
about your relationship

174
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,882
during my eunuch days.

175
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:48,545
So tell me.

176
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:51,798
Did she

177
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:53,678
mention me often?

178
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:57,009
She talked about you all the time.
She was heartbroken because of you.

179
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,176
How ridiculous. That is
rich coming from her.

180
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,480
What is it?

181
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,349
Did she break your
heart this time?

182
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,274
Did she cheat on you as well?

183
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:08,864
Seriously?

184
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,941
I was just joking. Has she
really fallen for someone new?

185
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,028
He is not new.

186
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,533
Then a former lover.

187
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,115
So? Did she go to him?

188
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:18,489
No, she did not.

189
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,748
He does not recognize her,
and she cannot go to him.

190
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,414
Is that so?

191
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,708
That must mean he is…

192
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,714
- married.
- Married?

193
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:32,085
Married?

194
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,473
That must be why he is ignoring

195
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,890
and rejecting her.

196
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,014
Darn it.

197
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:41,265
Seeing how he is not giving
in, he must be a good man.

198
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,979
She is the dangerous one.

199
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,443
She is ready to abandon you
and act like a moth to a flame.

200
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,650
She is not a moth.

201
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,399
And she has not
abandoned me yet.

202
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,363
Yet?

203
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,942
Does that mean you expect her
to abandon you in the future?

204
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,608
Darn it.

205
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,031
I should not be making
a joke out of this.

206
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:00,696
So please…

207
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,447
Please stop confusing me

208
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:06,287
by saying the guy is married
or that she is a moth.

209
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:09,844
Despite owning an ice
stone and reaching Hwansu,

210
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,089
you have failed to
win your wife's heart.

211
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:14,553
That power of yours is useless.

212
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,854
Despite your frustration, you cannot
see her due to this situation.

213
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:26,142
I will meet with her myself
and ask her what is going on.

214
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,227
Stay here.

215
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,105
A married man?

216
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,362
Darn it.

217
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:44,866
There is no way I can
bring up that topic

218
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,544
in a situation like this.

219
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,669
If I stop Jin Mu right now,

220
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,127
everything will fall apart.

221
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:58,471
This is our chance
to attack Jinyowon.

222
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,931
The plaque is missing, and
Bu-yeon is trapped in Gwido.

223
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:05,642
In addition, Jin Ho-gyeong
is too weak to protect her.

224
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:07,274
Will you make your
move right away?

225
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:12,399
I promised to introduce you
to the secret organization.

226
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,442
We will gather together tonight

227
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,942
and open Jinyowon's doors.

228
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,203
Tonight?

229
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,953
Tonight?

230
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,664
It is sooner than expected.

231
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:27,124
Please inform Songrim as well.

232
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:29,124
But there is one problem.

233
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,419
Jin Bu-yeon is locked
in Cheonbugwan's prison.

234
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:35,708
What prison?

235
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:39,184
Gwido, the prison that holds
those who once performed sorcery.

236
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,340
She is in there right now.

237
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:48,099
If you want me to open
Gwido's door right away,

238
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,234
I will do so.

239
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,310
However,

240
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,351
if I side with Jinyowon now,

241
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,518
Jin Mu's organization
will not gather tonight,

242
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,687
and Jin Mu will no
longer trust me.

243
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:58,985
What will you do?

244
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:00,449
I will do as you say.

245
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,267
I must go inside Gwido.

246
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,845
Please feign ignorance and step
aside, Your Royal Highness.

247
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:45,949
Jang Uk.

248
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,033
It is a turtle.

249
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:50,865
That is my turtle.

250
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:54,495
She took that turtle
with her into Gwido.

251
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,125
Hey, turtle.

252
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:57,915
How did you get out of there?

253
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,103
Jang Uk, come here.

254
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,563
That is the door to Gwido.

255
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,105
But why is it here?

256
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,229
Did you come out of there?

257
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:22,858
Someone opened the door here.

258
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:26,871
They must want us
to go in there.

259
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:28,741
Who?

260
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,698
Turtle, was it you?

261
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,078
The person who summoned us…

262
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,167
must be the one who is inside.

263
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:43,547
Bu-yeon must have summoned
Uk with her divine powers.

264
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:49,468
She must have opened the
door to protect herself.

265
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,965
Was it not you?

266
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:54,017
That is correct.
Bu-yeon opened it.

267
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,912
You have incredible
divine powers.

268
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:58,039
With such powers, you could
have cast away the wraith.

269
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,273
Why did you open the
door and summon Jang Uk?

270
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:02,741
You are right.

271
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:04,698
I should not have done that.

272
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,819
In the end, he saw something…

273
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,408
he should not have.

274
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,255
The ice stone in Jang Uk's body

275
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:28,841
was left behind by Master Seo
Gyeong to save Jin Seol-ran.

276
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,888
But she passed away.

277
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,517
So why do you think he
still left it in Jinyowon?

278
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,730
He could have just destroyed it.

279
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:39,104
What do you wish to say?

280
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,519
I heard you first
took out the ice stone

281
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,528
to use it to save your
unborn baby that had died.

282
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,568
And that baby grew
up to be Jin Bu-yeon.

283
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,660
If Jin Seol-ran's soul
remained in the ice stone,

284
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,503
I thought maybe the
baby you had saved

285
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:57,828
could have been Jin
Seol-ran herself.

286
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:02,884
Bu-yeon was blind from
birth just like Jin Seol-ran

287
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,132
and possessed astounding
divine powers.

288
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,554
Have you never

289
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,295
found that odd?

290
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:13,218
How is that relevant when I gave
birth and raised her myself?

291
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:20,403
If Bu-yeon possesses divine
powers similar to Jin Seol-ran's,

292
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,359
she will make it out of Gwido.

293
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:29,204
Perhaps Naksu willingly went there,
hoping to retrieve her divine powers.

294
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,071
Has she decided

295
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,287
to disappear in Gwido?

296
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:54,217
I looked around and
found no threats.

297
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,770
But this place is quite big.

298
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,770
Do you think you can
find the plaque alone?

299
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,980
This body will find it with divine
powers equal to Jin Seol-ran's.

300
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:09,186
Jang Uk tried to look for
you with his red jade.

301
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,663
Do you have the blue one?

302
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,500
Did he call me through this?

303
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,173
I did not know.

304
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,087
Did he give that to you?

305
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,800
That is not yours.

306
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,054
That belongs to someone else.

307
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,137
I know.

308
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,102
He temporarily left it with me

309
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,096
so I could read her memories.

310
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:45,017
You even have that
kind of power?

311
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:48,026
You are indeed not a shaman,
but a powerful priestess.

312
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,319
Give it to me.

313
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:54,202
It is not yours, so I
will return it to him.

314
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:00,661
In the past,

315
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:03,961
you also tried to take it.

316
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,091
I gave it back.

317
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,299
Do not lie.

318
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,229
She picked it up after
you threw it away.

319
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,547
You know one too many things.

320
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:20,853
She must remember me

321
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:24,272
as someone who is heinous.

322
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,270
She always wished

323
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:30,648
you were Jang Uk's ally

324
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:33,569
and not his enemy.

325
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,743
I am sure she is happy to see…

326
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,830
that you are helping him.

327
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,040
Whenever I showed my
pettiness in front of her,

328
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,035
she bad-mouthed
whomever I disliked.

329
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:50,591
Despite it all,

330
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:54,171
it was annoying and impressive to see
that she always sided with her master.

331
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:57,755
That is why I liked her.

332
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:00,806
She deceived you…

333
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,314
all along, Your Royal Highness.

334
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,271
I am aware of that.

335
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,776
So when she died,

336
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,379
I thought I would quickly forget
about her since she deceived me.

337
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,073
However,

338
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,451
that never happened.

339
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:29,632
I wanted to have her.

340
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:33,206
My graceless desire
to destroy something

341
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:36,378
that I could not have

342
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,894
definitely played a part in my
decision to turn my back on Jang Uk.

343
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,933
That is why whenever
I think of her,

344
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:46,935
I feel ashamed of myself,
and I feel painful remorse.

345
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,688
If she knows that
you are in pain…

346
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,395
she will probably

347
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,449
be content with that.

348
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:58,738
You are right.

349
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,870
She is not someone who would
tell me to stop being in pain.

350
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,616
If it is possible, I
would like her to know

351
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,963
that I am in…

352
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,298
an inexplicable amount of pain.

353
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:18,132
Still…

354
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,304
she would not want
the pain to last.

355
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,104
After you have been
in enough pain…

356
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:30,978
you should let go.

357
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,714
I found it in So-i's
belongings during her funeral.

358
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:53,044
The potion looked strange,
so I brought it here.

359
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,507
This is a soul potion
that is used in sorcery.

360
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,299
It is a heinous and
bewitching potion

361
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,683
that helps divination.

362
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:03,506
Master Heo.

363
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:07,675
Was not the Queen, who had been
locked up after shifting souls,

364
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,516
fed this potion?

365
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:11,602
You are right.

366
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,980
Shaman Choi concocted this.

367
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,573
How did So-i have this?

368
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,150
Jin Mu of Cheonbugwan

369
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:21,242
had something on her
and was using her.

370
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,527
It could be from Cheonbugwan.

371
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:26,617
I will look into it.

372
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,329
It must be that potion.

373
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,666
Madam So-i and Yeom-su,
a Cheonbugwan mage,

374
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,593
would feed it to others
once or twice a month.

375
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:41,426
She called it the bell potion.

376
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:42,508
The bell potion?

377
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:46,756
She said you would hear bells
and go insane if you consume it.

378
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,227
Do you know where and
on whom she used it?

379
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,521
No, I do not.

380
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:56,523
She rarely told me anything related
to Cheonbugwan since it was dangerous.

381
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:02,284
But she once mentioned an
individual who consumed it.

382
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:15,038
I rarely feel guilty for the
things I have done in my life.

383
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,785
But one thing bothers me.

384
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,626
There is one person
I feel bad for.

385
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:23,468
That person was very kind

386
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,223
and treated me well.

387
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:28,103
It must have been a guy.

388
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,260
You are wrong.

389
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:32,138
She was a girl I had
met in Sari Village.

390
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:37,311
Had I not stolen what was hers,

391
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:39,777
she would have found
her parents right away.

392
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:44,703
Then she would not have
gone crazy and died.

393
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,860
Gone crazy and died?

394
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:48,527
She was also a victim
of the bell potion.

395
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,117
So a girl she met
in Sari Village

396
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,497
consumed this same potion?

397
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,291
Yes.

398
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:04,166
You ignored me just like your father
did and never visited me once.

399
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:07,217
And now, you barge in here and
demand to know about the soul potion?

400
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:10,352
I heard you were force-fed that
potion when you were locked up.

401
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,600
Did you perhaps

402
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:14,522
hear the sound of
bells during that time?

403
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:24,652
I do not want to relive those
moments. That is enough.

404
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:25,736
This is important.

405
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:30,079
Someone seems to still be controlling
the soul shifters with this potion.

406
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:31,948
Shaman Choi, her
brother, and Jang Gang

407
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,655
turned her into a soul shifter.

408
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,806
They are all dead, so please do
not torment Her Highness anymore.

409
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:40,167
The potion may have altered
your memory, Your Highness.

410
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,752
Please try to remember.

411
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,207
I know it may be painful,

412
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,302
but please try to remember.

413
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:46,632
I said that was enough!

414
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:48,796
I am still in pain.

415
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:52,135
You do not deserve to ask for my help
when you cannot take away this pain.

416
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:55,642
We are trying to end the alchemy of
souls, which is the root of your pain.

417
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:57,305
I do not want it to end.

418
00:23:57,894 --> 00:24:00,314
I do not understand
why it is forbidden.

419
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:04,687
I, the Queen, want to take
a young, insignificant body.

420
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:05,776
Why is that wrong?

421
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,621
You almost died recently, Yul.

422
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,177
If the alchemy of
souls is permitted,

423
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:16,121
the precious son of the Seo family
will never worry about dying.

424
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:20,044
And you will be able to stay powerful
forever as the great leader of Songrim.

425
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,207
Do you not want that?

426
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,554
If someone powerful

427
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,510
has everything they
want and is immortal,

428
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:29,966
what will become of this world?

429
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:33,684
Rain is necessary, but it
should not last forever.

430
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:36,773
The sun is also necessary,
but it should set as well.

431
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:37,850
And no one

432
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:43,016
should stay powerful
and live forever.

433
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:50,952
That hypocrisy is what makes
everyone uncomfortable.

434
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,871
What do you think other
powerful individuals think?

435
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:58,160
We all want to join hands with the one
who will grant us everlasting power.

436
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,746
That is the truth.

437
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:01,921
And is that individual

438
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:03,632
Jin Mu?

439
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,500
- What?
- Please calm down, Your Highness.

440
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:08,667
Her Highness is very distressed.
You should all leave.

441
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:16,473
Jin Mu controlled the soul
shifters with his divination.

442
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:18,016
Perhaps Naksu

443
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,733
was also one of his victims.

444
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:26,782
Even so, that does not change the fact
that she practiced the alchemy of souls.

445
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:30,318
Still, I would like to reveal
the truth and lessen her burden

446
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:32,913
regarding the tragedy
three years ago.

447
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:38,035
Even Uk is in pain as he is
paying the price because of her.

448
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,869
Do you think he is in pain

449
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:44,165
solely because he is taking
responsibility for Naksu's sins?

450
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:46,729
Do you remember what
the Queen said today?

451
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:49,633
She did not see the fault
in powerful individuals

452
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,014
gaining everlasting power.

453
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,014
Uk already possesses that power.

454
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,809
What troubles him the most

455
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:00,099
is that he must
take responsibility

456
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:04,349
as someone who possesses the power
that Jin Mu and the Queen desire.

457
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:07,646
Depending on who Uk's target
is and which path he takes,

458
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:12,532
he could dry out this world,
just like Jin Mu wishes.

459
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,529
Or he could stop him.

460
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,662
Deciding whom to target

461
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,460
and which path to take

462
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:28,709
will always be
painful and a burden.

463
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:33,089
It may be too much
for a human to handle.

464
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,437
I saved her life

465
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:44,977
and took care of her.

466
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:48,362
You have taken
what Jin Ho-gyeong

467
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:51,072
has tried so hard to hide.

468
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:56,874
Master Lee must have known that
there was another soul within her.

469
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,199
He recognized it

470
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:02,198
and feigned
ignorance once again.

471
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:09,289
The same blue mark.

472
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:12,917
There was a huge tree
where I used to live.

473
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:16,756
So I imagined myself sitting
alone on top of a tall tree.

474
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:18,854
The same memory.

475
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:26,225
Just die if you are not
going to do anything.

476
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,941
It is better to die
than do nothing.

477
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:33,611
Are they the same person?

478
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:47,075
We found our way
here thanks to it.

479
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:51,165
It could help you find the
plaque, so keep it with you.

480
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,375
I will leave first.

481
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:55,303
Talk it out with Uk
before he leaves.

482
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:57,801
You should also reconcile.

483
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:00,048
He will be…

484
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:03,351
in a huge battle today.

485
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:06,811
Jin Mu's secret organization
will gather to attack Jinyowon.

486
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:08,853
And Uk will annihilate
all of the soul shifters.

487
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:12,897
We do not know their number
or how strong they are.

488
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:16,951
However, we must wipe out every
single one of them who is in hiding

489
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:20,409
to put an end to Jin
Mu's everlasting greed.

490
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:23,660
And Jang Uk is the only one
who is capable of doing that.

491
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:26,043
All of them will have to be
eradicated for this to end.

492
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:29,921
Every single one of them.

493
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:39,184
The Crown Prince left first.

494
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,509
We are now…

495
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:43,814
the only ones here.

496
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,559
All right.

497
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:50,413
You can ask what you
are curious about.

498
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:51,437
No.

499
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:54,106
I will not.

500
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:58,073
So you better not say a
word before I respond.

501
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:03,826
The war that I am about to start

502
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:06,624
is clearly and precisely right.

503
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:09,285
I am doing what I
can to stop them

504
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,420
from doing what
they should not do.

505
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:17,799
Some will try to condone it
with a believable justification.

506
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:20,471
Others will come up with
countless excuses to stop me.

507
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:24,144
But this fight is the
right thing to do.

508
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,720
That is why I know exactly
whom to point my sword at

509
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:30,061
and I know which path to take.

510
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:31,935
That is why

511
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,774
I must not recognize you here.

512
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:38,690
But let me ask you…

513
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:42,027
something else instead.

514
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:46,784
Should I…

515
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,292
not leave here?

516
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:53,793
Should I do absolutely nothing…

517
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:58,880
and stay here with you?

518
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:12,893
Should we do that?

519
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,857
I can probably
close Gwido's door.

520
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:19,650
Then should we…

521
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:22,776
stay here together?

522
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:29,992
But the answer is…

523
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,654
that such a decision would
clearly and precisely be wrong.

524
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:39,046
No matter the
justification or excuse.

525
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:41,126
Even if…

526
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,510
we were deeply
pining and longing…

527
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:51,682
for each other.

528
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,659
Dang-gu, go to Jinyowon.

529
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:11,292
Inform everyone and defend it.

530
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,290
- Yes, my lord.
- Yul and Sang-ho.

531
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,016
Once everyone is gathered
in the secret room,

532
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:19,920
go to Cheonbugwan and stop the officials
who are outside the secret room.

533
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,203
- Yes, my lord.
- Yes, my lord.

534
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:23,051
Once the battle begins,

535
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:25,881
I will go to the palace
and meet with the King.

536
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:28,717
I thought Jang Uk had
gone to North Fortress.

537
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:32,314
But he is going up against Jin
Mu alongside the Crown Prince.

538
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:36,270
He has decided to undertake
a great responsibility.

539
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:39,357
Please keep him safe.

540
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:41,653
Be safe as well.

541
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:47,567
Once the sun sets, Jin
Mu's gathering will begin.

542
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,066
Once this night passes
without problems,

543
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:54,618
the world they wish to
see will never come.

544
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:06,881
We will bring back the sky from
that fateful day 200 years ago.

545
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:09,467
The world will dry up.

546
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:11,432
And when we perform the rite,

547
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:17,055
the ice stone, full of energy of
the sky, will fall into our hands.

548
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:20,979
We will live in a world where
the strong gain greater power

549
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:25,525
and continue to rule forever!

550
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,867
Are you saying they
are all soul shifters?

551
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:37,253
Those who wished for youth
received younger bodies.

552
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,170
Those who wished for power received
the bodies of the powerful.

553
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:44,799
And those who wished for beauty
received alluring, beautiful bodies.

554
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:46,379
They all fulfilled their desires

555
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:49,175
through soul shifting.

556
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,968
They may be in hiding for now.

557
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:56,056
But once the door to
the new world opens,

558
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,480
they will be of great use
to you, Your Royal Highness.

559
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,560
Gwanju.

560
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,147
When that new world emerges,

561
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:10,364
what will become of those
who lose their bodies?

562
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,490
The young will age,

563
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:16,743
the powerful will lose their position,
and the beautiful will become ugly.

564
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:17,828
Your Royal Highness.

565
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:23,915
Did I not tell you not to allow yourself
to cling to something so insignificant?

566
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:29,879
I do not think that trying to protect
such things is a sign of weakness.

567
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:33,763
Rather, it is a
sign of strength.

568
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:38,595
And I am about to show you exactly
how powerful that strength is.

569
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,351
You have deceived me.

570
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:21,521
No, you just underestimated
me and thought I was weak.

571
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:24,151
I did everything for you.

572
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:28,516
And yet, are you
going to abandon me?

573
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:32,108
That is not how I would describe an
enemy whom I am about to confront.

574
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,990
I am here to fight against
you alongside Jang Uk!

575
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:44,874
Jang Uk?

576
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:05,685
Attack!

577
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,105
There is a barrier
around the secret room.

578
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:04,077
Jang Uk.

579
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:05,874
You are here.

580
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:19,237
There is no need to be alarmed.

581
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,950
I have only created a barrier.

582
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:25,449
But this one is much more complicated
than the one you had locked me in before.

583
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:34,417
I must say, I am quite busy fighting
all 78 soul shifters as we speak.

584
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,006
Funnily enough, only you,

585
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:22,489
the head of this secret
organization, are not a soul shifter.

586
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:24,469
Were you afraid of running wild?

587
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:28,182
Then why did you encourage others
to do something so harmful?

588
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:32,182
So you are finally here
to take your revenge.

589
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:34,428
I would not have come to do
something that meaningless.

590
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:39,072
I left behind a world that
I had always pined for.

591
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:40,859
Do you really think

592
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,571
I left that world
solely to kill you?

593
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:47,237
What you are doing
is absolutely wrong,

594
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,239
and it is absolutely
right for me to stop you.

595
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:53,289
So I am here to do
what I need to do.

596
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:58,924
It is true that I
vehemently resent you.

597
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,630
But that revenge is
not mine to take.

598
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:04,632
Go.

599
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:29,952
Go do what you can.

600
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,294
And I will stay here…

601
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:34,706
and do what I can.

602
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:37,540
Send Jin Mu here.

603
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:45,879
Why am I here?

604
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:53,179
The ice stone?

605
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,668
I definitely saw an ice stone.

606
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:21,456
Has there been one here as well?

607
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:02,287
It was here as I suspected.

608
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,089
That is an ice stone.

609
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:15,718
Right.

610
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:18,312
I forgot that you were here.

611
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,103
Jin Bu-yeon.

612
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:22,863
Did you find this?

613
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:27,361
Yes, just like how I found
one in Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.

614
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:30,147
I thought you had
lost your memory.

615
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:35,830
Anyway, I am impressed that
you found it once again.

616
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,200
You can have it.

617
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:39,117
It is yours.

618
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:41,285
The ice stone possesses
the energy of the sky.

619
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:44,376
Only the chosen ones
can possess its power.

620
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:47,670
Jang Gang and that mage of the Choi
family were able to use its power.

621
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:51,505
But they could not possess it
as their own like Jang Uk has.

622
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:53,092
Shall I help you?

623
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:55,678
You?

624
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:02,231
That is right.

625
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:09,152
You are a priestess comparable to
Jin Seol-ran, Seo Gyeong's lover.

626
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:12,737
All right.

627
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:14,948
Go on.

628
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:16,533
I will

629
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,410
make that yours.

630
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,620
What is happening to me?

631
00:42:57,783 --> 00:42:58,623
My energy…

632
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:00,661
That ice stone is empty.

633
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:05,577
It only desires to absorb energy

634
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:08,789
like a soul shifter
who has run wild.

635
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:18,222
You will not die quickly.

636
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:20,394
You will slowly wither away

637
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:22,468
like a piece of wood.

638
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:27,691
Just like that mage
of the Choi family.

639
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:29,652
Why would you…

640
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:33,244
do this?

641
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:35,359
You must remember
my face, do you not?

642
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:40,198
I guess you never thought
it could actually be me.

643
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:42,952
Danju.

644
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,090
Naksu?

645
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:54,261
This prison holds those
who have performed sorcery.

646
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:03,519
This is the kind of death
that suits you perfectly.

647
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:06,352
Do not resent me too much.

648
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:10,273
I will likely meet my end…

649
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,277
in this place as well.

650
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:43,721
Jang Uk.

651
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:47,386
You have finally done it.

652
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:51,063
Uk, are you all right?

653
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:54,732
Your body is as cold as ice.

654
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:56,359
It is bearable

655
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:58,403
for now.

656
00:44:58,821 --> 00:44:59,951
Where is Jin Mu?

657
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:01,821
I sent him to Gwido.

658
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:06,035
He will meet a demise
that suits him.

659
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:08,464
But Bu-yeon is still in there.

660
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:10,923
She asked me to send him there.

661
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:15,132
She wanted to fulfill
her role in all of this.

662
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:24,510
Uk.

663
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:39,952
Jin Mu of Cheonbugwan has been sent
to Gwido, the prison for sorcerers.

664
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:43,488
And every soul shifter in his
organization has been petrified to death.

665
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,834
And was this done single-handedly
by Jang Uk and Songrim?

666
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:47,079
Without telling anyone?

667
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:49,251
Today seemed like
our only opportunity,

668
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:53,170
so we had no time to discuss it
with you or the Unanimous Assembly.

669
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:56,170
The ice stone's power that Jang
Uk possesses sure is incredible.

670
00:45:56,753 --> 00:45:58,463
He, who belongs to Songrim,

671
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:01,127
has gotten rid of Jin
Mu, his only rival.

672
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:05,644
Songrim will challenge the royal family
and the Unanimous Assembly in no time.

673
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:09,683
This was not a power
struggle, Your Majesty.

674
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:12,726
We only interfered with
Jin Mu's dangerous scheme

675
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:15,151
of trying to steal the
fire bird from Jinyowon.

676
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:16,230
Whatever it may be,

677
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:19,402
everyone was forbidden
from possessing its power.

678
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:22,065
But Songrim indeed is the
only one to possess it.

679
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:25,739
Not everyone will
be happy about this.

680
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,210
Jin Mu is dead?

681
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:36,794
Then what will become of me?

682
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:38,167
Will I…

683
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:43,340
be trapped in this body forever?

684
00:46:45,093 --> 00:46:46,513
He is trapped in Gwido.

685
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:48,735
I do not think he will
make it out alive.

686
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:57,685
Find a way.

687
00:46:57,773 --> 00:47:00,033
You must find a way!

688
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:15,372
Seeing how Jin Mu came here,

689
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:21,462
Jang Uk and your master
must have done their job.

690
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:26,473
I will remain here…

691
00:47:28,428 --> 00:47:29,598
until my soul disappears.

692
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:34,849
Then only Jin Bu-yeon will
be left to leave this place.

693
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:37,979
If that happens…

694
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:44,235
I will not have to be
Jang Uk's final task.

695
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:02,089
It went into the sea.

696
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:06,337
But then again,
you are a turtle.

697
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:08,385
It is only natural
that you go to the sea.

698
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:38,212
This is the Jinyowon Plaque.

699
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:49,763
Did you find it for me

700
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:52,721
so I could leave this place?

701
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:56,849
In any case,

702
00:48:57,976 --> 00:48:59,136
thank you.

703
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:11,452
THE BLACK TORTOISE

704
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:14,292
I met a sacred animal that possessed
the energy of the Black Tortoise.

705
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:16,448
It was diligently
crawling somewhere.

706
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:18,909
It must have found
a path for someone.

707
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:26,048
I heard Jang Uk entered Gwido
to look for Jin Bu-yeon.

708
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:30,550
Seeing how he left that place, he
must have found his path as well.

709
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:33,724
After putting an end to
the difficult battle,

710
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:37,474
Uk is single-handedly
enduring the consequences.

711
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:54,985
He is weathering the wraiths that
are drawn by the energy of the sky.

712
00:49:55,075 --> 00:50:00,075
He is fighting another battle in
a cold, dark place all by himself.

713
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,708
Why do you think he was chosen

714
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:09,128
to carry this burden?

715
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:12,224
Is he paying the price for being
a product of the alchemy of souls?

716
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:15,931
While the most powerful
fought over the ice stone,

717
00:50:16,012 --> 00:50:19,772
it found its way to him.

718
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:22,935
I believe

719
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:25,805
she was behind it all along.

720
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:31,781
She? Whom are you speaking of?

721
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:34,952
The one who first received the
ice stone from Master Seo Gyeong.

722
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:40,041
I believe she has remained here and
has been protecting the ice stone.

723
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:43,460
Are you talking
about Jin Seol-ran?

724
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:50,337
It is my assumption
that she chose

725
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:53,340
both Jang Uk and that girl.

726
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:02,226
Are you all right?

727
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:04,944
I am sorry.

728
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:07,767
I should have gone
instead of you.

729
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:09,266
I am all right.

730
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:11,857
I found the plaque.

731
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:17,373
You did it.

732
00:51:18,074 --> 00:51:20,124
You are really my
daughter, Bu-yeon.

733
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:21,994
I am sorry.

734
00:51:22,662 --> 00:51:24,002
Do not be sorry.

735
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:26,634
Now that you have found it,

736
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:28,168
Jinyowon will be safe.

737
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:32,551
The Unanimous Assembly will be
summoned today regarding Jin Mu.

738
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:34,761
You will have to explain
what happened in Gwido.

739
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:35,971
Will you

740
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:37,968
be able to do it?

741
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:39,223
Yes, I can.

742
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:42,135
I will attend the
Unanimous Assembly.

743
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:47,401
Seo Yul has been
waiting for you.

744
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:48,938
You should go see him.

745
00:51:58,532 --> 00:51:59,622
Uk and I…

746
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:05,038
have decided to feign ignorance.

747
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:09,500
I hope you will do the same.

748
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:13,297
I have something to tell you.

749
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:17,631
Jin Mu could control the soul
shifters with his divination.

750
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:19,635
So I believe…

751
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:23,389
that the tragic events in
Songrim three years ago

752
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:27,771
did not occur out of Naksu's
will, but because of Jin Mu.

753
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:44,905
So that was why

754
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,250
I heard those bells.

755
00:52:57,465 --> 00:52:59,795
If you are blaming
yourself for what happened,

756
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:04,008
I wanted to let you know
you do not need to do that.

757
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:11,396
I hope this excuse…

758
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:16,573
will let you stay
where you want to be.

759
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:22,486
I was merely a soul shifter
who was driven by vengeance.

760
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:27,451
I was an assassin raised in
Danhyanggok with that one purpose.

761
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:30,038
And I just simply met my demise.

762
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:34,084
So that…

763
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:39,553
cannot be an excuse.

764
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:57,233
You are really going
to North Fortress?

765
00:53:57,317 --> 00:53:59,107
If I remain here,

766
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:02,164
people will torment Lord Park and
Songrim regarding the ice stone.

767
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:04,449
I must obey the King's command

768
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:06,473
for the Crown
Prince's sake as well.

769
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:08,584
When will you be leaving?

770
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:11,832
I have been given a position
there, so I must leave right away.

771
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:14,418
So I am afraid

772
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:17,088
that I will not be
attending your wedding.

773
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:18,920
That is not the problem.

774
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:22,593
You are going far away. Who
knows when we will meet again?

775
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:24,926
You can visit me with Lord Park.

776
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:27,762
Then how about I
follow you for now...

777
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:28,847
No.

778
00:54:29,265 --> 00:54:30,265
I said no.

779
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:35,607
Do not say that to him. He is
already very jealous of me.

780
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:37,521
It cannot be helped.

781
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:39,727
You will always be
my top priority.

782
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:40,898
I know.

783
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:44,163
But do not express
such feelings to him.

784
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,580
He does get sulky easily.

785
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:51,412
Maidservant Kim.

786
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:54,457
I may not be there
for the wedding,

787
00:54:55,291 --> 00:54:57,251
but make sure you are the
prettiest person there.

788
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:01,298
Make sure you look like the
happiest woman in the world.

789
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:03,924
I will.

790
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:07,005
I promise to look the prettiest

791
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:09,845
and happiest.

792
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:32,409
I did not know Uk was
concerned about that.

793
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:36,875
Let us also move to North
Fortress after our wedding.

794
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:38,708
Will you be fine with that?

795
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:43,052
I am no longer the leader of Songrim.
I am free to go wherever I want.

796
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:46,928
Is that why you did not attend
the Unanimous Assembly today?

797
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:49,054
If I remain here,

798
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:52,769
they will pester Uk
regarding the ice stone.

799
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:54,979
That is exactly what he said.

800
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:56,773
In that case,

801
00:55:57,353 --> 00:55:59,403
let us move there right
after the wedding.

802
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:01,901
Promise me.

803
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:08,275
Hold on.

804
00:56:08,364 --> 00:56:10,534
Why are you wearing
the ring on your pinky?

805
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:12,449
It is for this finger.

806
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:14,115
It is too small.

807
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:17,333
It stops my blood circulation.

808
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:18,786
Is that so?

809
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:19,875
Then take it off.

810
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:21,539
I will make it bigger

811
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:23,628
or get you a larger size.

812
00:56:25,006 --> 00:56:25,836
Goodness.

813
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:26,924
That is fine.

814
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:29,641
It is a promise of
our everlasting love.

815
00:56:30,386 --> 00:56:31,676
I do not mind it.

816
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:35,390
That is right.

817
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:36,809
It is a promise.

818
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:44,482
Will you be going to North
Fortress by yourself as arranged?

819
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:47,987
There will only be peace
and quiet if I leave.

820
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:50,197
Uk.

821
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:53,703
I am here to tell you something

822
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:57,214
that will bring about
neither peace nor quiet.

823
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:05,127
The pain you will feel upon
learning of it or ignoring it

824
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:08,841
is something you should endure,

825
00:57:09,717 --> 00:57:11,257
not for me to decide.

826
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:13,562
That is why I am here.

827
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:20,976
Naksu will disappear soon.

828
00:57:23,314 --> 00:57:27,654
She believes that no justification is
reasonable enough to stay by your side.

829
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:30,284
But will this be

830
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,780
a good justification for you?

831
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:37,161
Yul.

832
00:57:38,496 --> 00:57:39,616
Do you know how I felt

833
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:43,384
when I decided to
feign ignorance…

834
00:57:45,503 --> 00:57:46,883
and leave her behind?

835
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:05,979
I turned away with the knowledge

836
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,690
that I must slay her if I
acknowledged who she was.

837
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,683
Her approaching death

838
00:58:35,803 --> 00:58:37,723
cannot be an excuse
for us to be together.

839
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:46,975
Instead of using my coming death as
a cowardly excuse to be together…

840
00:58:47,565 --> 00:58:48,565
It is much better…

841
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:53,316
for us to be tormented instead.

842
00:59:11,172 --> 00:59:13,292
I, Jin Bu-yeon, the eldest
daughter of the Jin family,

843
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:15,511
have retrieved the plaque
from Gwido to prove

844
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:17,604
my power as a priestess.

845
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:35,284
I heard Jang Uk sent
Jin Mu to Gwido.

846
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:36,413
What happened to him?

847
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:39,489
I found the ice stone that belonged
to that mage of the Choi family

848
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:42,003
and put it inside of him.

849
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:45,747
Jin Mu…

850
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,170
will eventually
wither away and die.

851
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:17,276
It desires to
absorb human energy

852
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:18,993
like a soul shifter
that has run wild.

853
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:21,204
So you put that inside of him.

854
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:23,791
It may have lost the
energy of the sky,

855
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:25,460
but it is still an ice stone.

856
01:00:25,538 --> 01:00:27,708
And you put that inside of him.

857
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:30,043
I am impressed by
your divine powers.

858
01:00:32,503 --> 01:00:34,883
If you could put it
inside of someone,

859
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:38,184
that must mean you can
take it out as well.

860
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:41,385
The main purpose of
today's Unanimous Assembly

861
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:44,391
is to discuss what to do
with Jang Uk's ice stone.

862
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:46,734
Since she can take
out the ice stone,

863
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:48,599
we can retrieve
Jang Uk's ice stone

864
01:00:48,686 --> 01:00:50,856
if we agree on it today.

865
01:00:50,938 --> 01:00:55,488
But Jang Uk will die if the ice
stone is removed from his body.

866
01:00:55,568 --> 01:00:57,648
He should have died
three years ago.

867
01:00:57,737 --> 01:00:59,317
He is only alive
due to the decision

868
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:01,133
of the royal family and
the Unanimous Assembly.

869
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:03,237
If Jang Uk did not stop Jin Mu,

870
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:05,906
the fire bird would have emerged
and caused chaos in the world.

871
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:07,325
Songrim should not intervene!

872
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:11,044
We are only having this conversation
because you decided to be rash

873
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:14,125
instead of asking the royal family or
the Unanimous Assembly for permission.

874
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:15,671
I took part…

875
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:18,627
in their plan.

876
01:01:18,716 --> 01:01:19,966
Do not intervene.

877
01:01:21,219 --> 01:01:23,299
You deliberately did
so without my consent.

878
01:01:24,222 --> 01:01:26,312
- You should not have done that.
- But, Your Majesty…

879
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:31,601
We only allowed Jang Uk
to keep that ice stone

880
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:33,978
so that he could obliterate
the soul shifters.

881
01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:35,775
He does not need
its power anymore

882
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:38,568
since there are no more
soul shifters left.

883
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:40,203
- Right.
- I agree.

884
01:01:40,279 --> 01:01:41,590
- True.
- Take the ice stone back.

885
01:01:41,614 --> 01:01:43,074
That is only natural.

886
01:01:43,157 --> 01:01:45,537
- Right.
- He is right.

887
01:01:50,289 --> 01:01:52,709
If that is what the
Unanimous Assembly decides,

888
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:56,002
you must also abide by
it as a fellow member

889
01:01:56,087 --> 01:01:57,757
and Jinyowon's heiress.

890
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:01,681
If that is what the
Unanimous Assembly decides,

891
01:02:03,344 --> 01:02:04,894
then I must follow
their decision.

892
01:02:17,191 --> 01:02:18,031
Your Highness.

893
01:02:18,109 --> 01:02:19,939
That is the door to Gwido.

894
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:22,283
You can find Jin Mu there.

895
01:02:22,363 --> 01:02:23,841
You can ask him where
the Soul Ejector is

896
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:26,275
and how you can perform
the alchemy of souls.

897
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:31,117
Yun-o, how did you find
the key to that door?

898
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:35,077
My friends from
Cheonbugwan helped me.

899
01:02:35,668 --> 01:02:36,668
Is that so?

900
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:40,714
Let us go.

901
01:02:48,973 --> 01:02:49,973
Uk.

902
01:02:51,225 --> 01:02:52,055
Where is Bu-yeon?

903
01:02:52,143 --> 01:02:54,383
She agreed to abide by the
Unanimous Assembly's decision.

904
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:55,937
She has left now.

905
01:03:10,745 --> 01:03:14,575
We were discussing what to do
with the ice stone within you.

906
01:03:14,665 --> 01:03:17,075
If we decide to retrieve it,

907
01:03:17,168 --> 01:03:21,878
Jin Bu-yeon, the priestess of
Jinyowon, will take it out of you.

908
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:25,594
Did she say that she
would abide by it?

909
01:03:25,676 --> 01:03:26,676
That is right.

910
01:03:27,094 --> 01:03:31,684
And she exposed all the
sins you have committed.

911
01:03:37,522 --> 01:03:38,522
Last night,

912
01:03:39,524 --> 01:03:41,984
he spared one soul shifter.

913
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:44,992
He knew that individual
was a soul shifter,

914
01:03:46,322 --> 01:03:47,872
but he feigned ignorance.

915
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:49,699
Is that true?

916
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:52,994
Yes.

917
01:03:53,454 --> 01:03:54,794
I feigned ignorance.

918
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:04,013
So did she want me to
slay that soul shifter?

919
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:07,970
Please tell him to stop
feigning ignorance.

920
01:04:10,137 --> 01:04:11,847
Tell him to confirm
its existence

921
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:14,385
and watch it…

922
01:04:17,061 --> 01:04:18,311
wither away.

923
01:04:20,439 --> 01:04:23,189
She gave me a reason and an
excuse to find that soul shifter.

924
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:24,776
A reason and an excuse?

925
01:04:25,486 --> 01:04:28,236
That was your duty.

926
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:29,823
In that case,

927
01:04:30,324 --> 01:04:31,954
I will fulfill my duty

928
01:04:32,577 --> 01:04:33,997
and no longer feign ignorance.

929
01:04:36,789 --> 01:04:38,579
I will confirm its existence

930
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:40,786
and watch it wither away.

931
01:04:41,586 --> 01:04:42,586
Now,

932
01:04:43,629 --> 01:04:45,209
I will leave.

933
01:04:46,007 --> 01:04:47,337
Where are you going?

934
01:04:47,425 --> 01:04:49,135
We are discussing
what you have done!

935
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:51,008
That is over now!

936
01:05:04,525 --> 01:05:06,685
I will accept your
reason and excuse,

937
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:08,570
and I will leave.

938
01:05:13,868 --> 01:05:16,248
Stop uttering such words.

939
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:18,619
We are only telling you
to fulfill your duty!

940
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:22,585
Are we not retrieving
the ice stone?

941
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:34,679
What is going on?

942
01:05:35,389 --> 01:05:36,589
There is still a soul shifter?

943
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:40,310
That is right.

944
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:42,484
Uk will not return

945
01:05:44,065 --> 01:05:45,265
until he catches them.

946
01:07:17,324 --> 01:07:18,324
In the end,

947
01:07:19,994 --> 01:07:22,874
you used what is between
us as a reason and excuse

948
01:07:25,082 --> 01:07:26,382
to bring me here.

949
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:30,381
My merciless master.

950
01:07:33,257 --> 01:07:34,627
I am not your master anymore.

951
01:07:36,969 --> 01:07:37,969
I have already…

952
01:07:40,473 --> 01:07:41,723
let you go.

953
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:06,353
I found him, Your
Highness! I see Jin Mu!

954
01:09:07,059 --> 01:09:08,559
Gwanju!

955
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:20,607
You are on the brink of death.

956
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:30,120
Jin Mu.

957
01:09:30,207 --> 01:09:31,787
Tell me one thing
before you die.

958
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:33,788
One last Soul Ejector remains.

959
01:09:34,378 --> 01:09:36,008
Where is it? Do you have it?

960
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:39,933
Pull yourself
together. Where is it?

961
01:09:49,643 --> 01:09:52,153
Jin Mu. Give me
the Soul Ejector.

962
01:09:52,229 --> 01:09:53,859
You made a promise to me.

963
01:09:53,939 --> 01:09:57,029
Hand it over before you die.

964
01:10:00,654 --> 01:10:01,494
Yes.

965
01:10:01,572 --> 01:10:03,622
Where is it?

966
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:09,908
My last Soul Ejector

967
01:10:12,082 --> 01:10:16,462
is inside the blood of the
mage of the Choi family

968
01:10:17,755 --> 01:10:21,085
who created it in
the first place.

969
01:10:27,139 --> 01:10:29,639
Are you saying it
is inside of me?

970
01:10:45,824 --> 01:10:47,834
I put it inside your body

971
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:50,870
when I was shifting your soul.

972
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:54,830
I guess you did
not remember that.

973
01:11:04,301 --> 01:11:07,931
It is all coming back to me now.

974
01:11:09,181 --> 01:11:11,891
The one who shifted my
soul and locked me up

975
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:13,890
was you,

976
01:11:15,437 --> 01:11:16,477
Jin Mu!

977
01:11:52,683 --> 01:11:53,893
Gwanju.

978
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:57,306
I came here to rescue you.
Let us leave together.

979
01:11:57,396 --> 01:11:58,606
That is right.

980
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:01,565
We will leave this
place together.

981
01:12:03,068 --> 01:12:04,068
No.

982
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:07,949
I will leave this
place in your body.

983
01:14:42,811 --> 01:14:44,061
Did you go to Gwido?

984
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:46,436
Was Jin Mu still alive?

985
01:14:46,523 --> 01:14:49,573
So you were the one who sent me
there to save him, Your Majesty.

986
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:53,860
He had promised to
give me immense powers,

987
01:14:53,947 --> 01:14:56,157
so I must at least know
how to acquire them.

988
01:14:56,241 --> 01:14:58,871
So tell me. Did you meet him?

989
01:14:59,995 --> 01:15:01,905
You are looking at him
right now, Your Majesty.

990
01:15:03,707 --> 01:15:04,707
Your Majesty.

991
01:15:05,626 --> 01:15:06,996
Do you still not understand?

992
01:15:08,962 --> 01:15:10,552
I am Jin Mu.

993
01:15:15,135 --> 01:15:16,345
You have shifted souls!

994
01:15:21,433 --> 01:15:24,653
So this is the very power
that you have promised me.

995
01:15:24,728 --> 01:15:26,938
If we share the power
of the ice stone,

996
01:15:27,481 --> 01:15:30,151
we will live forever as the
strong gain greater power.

997
01:15:33,278 --> 01:15:36,528
Now, come on out and let us
walk down the path together

998
01:15:37,574 --> 01:15:40,544
to acquire that very power.

999
01:17:05,912 --> 01:17:08,832
ALCHEMY OF SOULS PART 2

1000
01:17:09,583 --> 01:17:10,977
There is only one
reply I can give you

1001
01:17:11,001 --> 01:17:13,251
in our last moment together.

1002
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:16,260
We must go to Jinyowon at once
and bring out the fire bird.

1003
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:18,430
- Bring me the ice stone.
- Your Majesty!

1004
01:17:18,508 --> 01:17:21,348
What are you trying to do by fooling
the King and Unanimous Assembly?

1005
01:17:22,054 --> 01:17:23,394
Uk.

1006
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:26,482
Uk, Jin is…

1007
01:17:27,934 --> 01:17:31,944
I fear that the same kind of
chaos may occur once again.

1008
01:17:32,022 --> 01:17:33,062
The fire bird will awaken.

1009
01:17:33,106 --> 01:17:35,186
I was told that it is going
to happen no matter what.

1010
01:17:38,195 --> 01:17:43,195
