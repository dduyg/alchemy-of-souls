1
00:00:39,234 --> 00:00:43,037
This room will be vacant
while our young master stays in Songrim.

2
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:45,920
Clean up his books and clothes.

3
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:47,287
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

4
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:54,161
He had left home a dozen times
and returned every time.

5
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:57,209
You should wait a few days
in case he comes back again.

6
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,294
It is different this time.

7
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:03,006
He is a changed man.

8
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,510
And he may bring home a wife soon.

9
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,760
That is why we need to clean up.

10
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:11,600
Is he getting engaged again?

11
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:15,856
If this one falls through yet again,
he will never be able to get married.

12
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:17,868
It is different this time.

13
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:22,985
Young Master Jang has a lady
he has deep feelings for.

14
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:25,608
Right, Mu-deok?

15
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,910
The bird egg that he mentioned.

16
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:34,950
I believe it is that lady
I met in Songrim.

17
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:38,264
A bird egg on top of a tree.

18
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:41,041
She must be a sophisticated woman

19
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,269
whom he wants to protect.

20
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:46,063
She must be someone like an egret.

21
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:47,189
Like me.

22
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,726
Who knows?

23
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:54,030
Once it hatches,
it may turn out to be a vicious eagle,

24
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,357
not a sophisticated egret.

25
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,026
Is that so?

26
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,403
A vicious eagle, how frightful.

27
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,456
I hope it is not a woodpecker
or a cuckoo either.

28
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,283
Do not worry.

29
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:08,861
Once it hatches,
I am sure it will fly away.

30
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:13,529
How could she
when she has feelings for him?

31
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:19,499
If they were that close,
I am sure the feelings were mutual.

32
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:22,544
The bird must be in love with him as well.

33
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,551
I really hope it is Young Lady Heo.

34
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,976
She resembles Madam Do-hwa too.

35
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:33,986
-Mr. Lee.
-Yes?

36
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,433
Leave those there.
They are Master Jang's books.

37
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,272
Hurry up.

38
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:45,322
What Uk and I shared

39
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,689
was the desperate feeling of survival

40
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:54,624
and the earnestness of finding ourselves.

41
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,173
Once we got what we wanted,

42
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:10,168
we promised to part ways
without looking back.

43
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:15,220
The love that Maidservant Kim mentioned

44
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,893
may have seeped in between us.

45
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:25,648
But it is nothing but a shell
that I will leave behind once I hatch.

46
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,938
You have already memorized
and written all of this down?

47
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:54,975
Yes, please feel free to check.
I am certain I memorized everything.

48
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:58,904
Even so,

49
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:01,240
it should have taken you at least a month.

50
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:05,197
I have served 12 masters so far
and thus have read the same book 12 times.

51
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,745
You could say

52
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:09,206
that this task was a piece of cake,
to say the least.

53
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,710
I was wondering
why he agreed to obey the rules.

54
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,336
He had his reasons.

55
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,873
Now that I can leave Songrim
whenever I want, I will go home.

56
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:19,662
Not so fast.

57
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,059
Why not?

58
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:32,271
The rules say that I can leave
once I master the basic education.

59
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:34,523
When I asked you to read that,

60
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,650
I did not simply mean to memorize it.

61
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:38,807
I wanted you to engrave it in your heart.

62
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,780
But since you were sly enough
to deceive us,

63
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:45,317
I do not believe
that you have mastered this learning.

64
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,317
I did not know

65
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:51,904
that the leader could change
Songrim's rules however he wanted.

66
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,192
Here you go.

67
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:56,825
I have another task for you.

68
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,658
If you read this book as well,

69
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:04,295
then I will allow you
to leave Songrim whenever you wish.

70
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,135
No!

71
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,515
Are you sure that I can go outside

72
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,070
after reading this book?

73
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,397
That is right.

74
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:26,025
I hope reading this book

75
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:29,350
will be another piece of cake for you.

76
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,331
This is terrible.

77
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,898
Mu-deok will not be able
to see Uk for a while.

78
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:50,212
What? This is empty.

79
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:56,670
No, it is not.
There are words written on those papers.

80
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:58,774
No, there are not.

81
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,511
Do you see anything here?

82
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,349
It is you who cannot see.

83
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:06,657
You can only read it
once you focus your energy.

84
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,394
That is Master Seo Gyeong's book,
Words of the Heart,

85
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,068
I see.

86
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,710
So there are actual words on these papers?

87
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,667
So I am the only one who cannot read it?

88
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,594
Your friend, Uk,

89
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:29,430
must have not known what that book was.

90
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:33,058
He has never received proper training.
Of course he would not know.

91
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:35,019
He will be stuck in the Training Center

92
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,716
until he can read it.

93
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:38,439
I feel bad for him.

94
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,556
He will probably
be stuck there for half a year.

95
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:43,861
Even six months
would be too short for him.

96
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:47,558
He mastered Ryusu
due to pure luck, not training.

97
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:50,897
It will take him more than a year.

98
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,463
How do you know that
when you were never given that book?

99
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:05,424
I know you need
ample training to read that book.

100
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:08,161
Then know that he is far ahead of you.

101
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,584
Unlike him who received that book,

102
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,797
you have not touched it yet.

103
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,522
He is right. You should not gossip.

104
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:21,839
Bye.

105
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,682
Darn it.

106
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:32,237
I wonder why my uncle
gave him that book already.

107
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:34,953
I am baffled as well.

108
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:38,940
He will not be able to do anything
while he is stuck there.

109
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:46,874
I have

110
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,836
no intention of training Uk.

111
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:53,639
I am going to keep him near me
and check up on him

112
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:56,558
so that he will not cause
any trouble outside.

113
00:07:56,642 --> 00:08:01,715
So you did not take him under your wing.
You just locked him up in Songrim.

114
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,804
Since Uk has entered Songrim with a fuss,

115
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,861
his father will be coming.

116
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:10,030
By "father", do you mean Jang Gang?

117
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:13,277
Jang Gang's biggest fear
was that Uk's gate of energy would be open

118
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,483
and that he would go out into the open.

119
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,447
Once he gets wind of this,

120
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,084
he will come.

121
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:26,661
The Gwanju needs to return
in order to get rid of Jin Mu.

122
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,830
Everything will be solved

123
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:33,448
once he returns.

124
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,174
I feel bad for Uk.

125
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,768
He came this far

126
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,104
without receiving any training.

127
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,564
How can he read Words of the Heart?

128
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,051
It is an impossible task.

129
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:56,020
Why would you give him these snacks?

130
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,745
I heard some things
about Young Master Jang.

131
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:01,123
He has a complicated family history,
barely any skills,

132
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,650
-and a terrible personality.
-That is not true.

133
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:06,879
He is a good man.

134
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,047
Why would you think that?

135
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,674
He is so fussy

136
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:14,121
that the only person who can put up
with him is the maid Mu-deok.

137
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,764
-Mu-deok?
-Yes.

138
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:20,961
She is the maid who is always by his side.

139
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,305
Mu-deok.

140
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:30,486
I heard you stayed by my side all night.

141
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,853
I thought you were Mu-deok.
I apologize for the trouble.

142
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:38,104
So that is why he thought I was her.

143
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,326
Hello.

144
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:48,951
We are from Sejukwon.

145
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,245
This way, my lady.

146
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:31,569
Wait. The fire…

147
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:58,699
Here you go.

148
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,566
I have another task for you.

149
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,082
He deceived me.

150
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,279
He did a number on me!

151
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:28,103
Hey, we meet again.

152
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:31,940
Hello. Are you going somewhere?

153
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,557
Well, yes. I need to meet someone outside.

154
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:37,727
But why are you leaving that way?

155
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,348
Because I am running away.

156
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:46,157
Please turn a blind eye to this as well.

157
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,795
My gosh. Young Lady Heo is so impatient.
Why did she not wait for me?

158
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,372
Why did she leave me behind?

159
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,368
What is the matter?

160
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,541
Is Jang Uk not in his room?

161
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,708
Yes, he is.

162
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:09,519
Let us go upstairs then.

163
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:13,315
I need to talk to him.

164
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,262
In private, please.

165
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:20,934
This will take some time. Wait outside.

166
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:43,595
Mu-deok, the young master
from Songrim is here.

167
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,332
He is looking for you.

168
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,678
Hello, Young Master Seo.

169
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,982
You must have been expecting Uk.

170
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:12,982
He will not be back for some time.

171
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,689
He was given a difficult task to complete.

172
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,948
He will do well.

173
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:20,915
It is most crucial for him to remain there

174
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,995
and receive training as of now.

175
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:27,748
I was concerned after how you left
that day, but you look fine.

176
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,674
What have you been doing?

177
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:35,131
I am just a maid here,
so I have been doing housework.

178
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,983
Maidservant Kim is away at the moment.

179
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,720
You can wait in the study.

180
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,055
I am here to see you, not her.

181
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,099
Me?

182
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,481
Why would you want to see me?

183
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,354
Well…

184
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:52,192
The umbrella.

185
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:56,860
I came to get the umbrella
I had lent you that day.

186
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,463
That umbrella?

187
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:02,490
The wind tore it open
on my way home, so I threw it away.

188
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:04,872
Is that so?

189
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,167
Then let us go.

190
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:09,556
What?

191
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,224
We should get a new one.

192
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:14,091
You need to buy me a new umbrella.

193
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:19,517
UMBRELLAS

194
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:25,447
This looks exactly like
the umbrella you lent me.

195
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,064
That is made of low-quality…

196
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:31,119
That is a disposable umbrella
made of low-quality paper.

197
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,526
Mine was made
from high-quality sheepskin and bamboo.

198
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,530
High-quality, you say?

199
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:39,377
Why did you give a maid
such an expensive umbrella?

200
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:41,379
I had only lent it to you.

201
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:43,786
You should compensate for losing it.

202
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:48,595
And that was my one and only umbrella.

203
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:51,807
Why would a young master like you
only have one umbrella?

204
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,174
I rarely go out when it is raining.

205
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:59,300
I had hurt my leg as a child,
and it still hurts when it rains.

206
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:03,589
Is your broken leg still giving you pain?

207
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:10,771
Young Master Park told me
about how you had broken your leg.

208
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,870
Yes, back in Danhyanggok.

209
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:17,737
I pity you for being a mage
who has a weak leg.

210
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,938
Your leg probably did not heal properly.

211
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:24,666
There was a friend

212
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:27,835
who used to wait for me in Danhyanggok.

213
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,625
She saved me and treated my wound.

214
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:36,137
My leg must not have healed properly

215
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,252
because I had not thanked her.

216
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,619
-I like this one.
-Pardon?

217
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,946
I will take this one. Go and pay for it.

218
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,319
Yes, Young Master Seo.

219
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,506
-We will take this one.
-All right.

220
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,203
Please put it on Master Jang Gang's tab.

221
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,658
Why would you do that?
You should pay for it.

222
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,557
A maid like me has no money.

223
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,044
Of course, you do.

224
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,019
I saw you go out

225
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:21,396
and buy clothes
with the money you keep hidden.

226
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,013
That was because…

227
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:30,572
-How much is it?
-You have a good eye.

228
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,269
That is our most expensive umbrella.

229
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:39,688
Darn it.

230
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,408
Mu-deok is not here?

231
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:50,300
Why did she have to be away
now of all times?

232
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:53,047
Young Master Jang,
were you kicked out again?

233
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,972
No, I was not.
I only stopped by for a minute.

234
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,891
I will be going back soon.

235
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:58,808
I see.

236
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:00,885
Mu-deok will be here soon.

237
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,924
Should I prepare a bath for you
in the meantime?

238
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:05,398
That sounds nice.

239
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,901
It has been a while
since I last bathed in this house.

240
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,298
-I will get it ready then.
-Sure.

241
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:27,529
Hold on.

242
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,952
Were our honey biscuits always this sweet?

243
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,543
Why does Songrim not have any snacks?

244
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:38,254
Our leader also had a sweet tooth
back in the day.

245
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:59,355
Are we breaking up today?

246
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,693
Yes.

247
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:05,166
The three big-mouthed sisters will be done
with their floriculture class

248
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,613
and will pass us by soon.

249
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,337
If we argue in front of them then,

250
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,204
they will gossip about how we broke up.

251
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,514
As I promised,

252
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:22,171
I will be the reason for our breakup.

253
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:25,061
First, slap me hard across my face.

254
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:28,088
Then push me away
when I cling onto you and leave.

255
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,567
That seems a bit extreme…

256
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,360
We have to go that far

257
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:35,447
for them to believe
that we really broke off our engagement.

258
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:39,034
Then people will bad-mouth you.

259
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:42,771
There will be no matchmaking for you
if you have a bad reputation.

260
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,864
I do not wish

261
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:49,610
to get married by matchmaking.

262
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,913
I will marry the woman

263
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,247
who I like.

264
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,346
Still, slapping is too much.

265
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:11,307
I will pour this on you instead.

266
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:14,806
Sure. You can do that.

267
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,768
The tea is too hot.

268
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:23,067
Your face will burn.

269
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,863
Goodness.

270
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:31,957
It is fine.

271
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:37,454
There will be a magic show in a few days.

272
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,914
I really wanted to watch it.

273
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:44,504
But I will not be able to
if we break up today.

274
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:47,227
Wait. Why not?

275
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:51,304
Up until now,
I stayed home for at least a month

276
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:54,548
after breaking off an engagement.

277
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:58,350
I see.

278
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:06,162
Then should we postpone
our breakup for a few days?

279
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:07,229
Should we?

280
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:13,450
But those three sisters will be there too.

281
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:17,702
I do not think I should go there alone.

282
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:22,373
Then since they think
we are a couple, I will go with you.

283
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:26,967
Well, I suppose.

284
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:34,566
I would like
some pumpkin taffy, rice taffy,

285
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,693
and honey biscuits.

286
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,100
Sure.

287
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,656
My young master is like a child.

288
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,023
He gets cranky
when there are no snacks around.

289
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,138
Please give them to him.

290
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:51,291
I like these pine pollen tea snacks.

291
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,002
I suspected you would have
expensive tastes.

292
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,609
-Would you like some of that too?
-No, thank you.

293
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,089
RECRUITING SERVANTS FOR SONGRIM

294
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,354
RECRUITING SERVANTS FOR SONGRIM

295
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:16,551
QUALIFICATIONS: HEALTHY, LITERATE,
CAN CALCULATE, NO CRIMINAL RECORD

296
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,103
I will put this on the Jang family's tab.

297
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,234
Please give these to Young Master Jang.

298
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:33,938
I have some business
to take care of. Goodbye.

299
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:51,935
Here you go.

300
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,592
-Have a look around.
-I will.

301
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:55,355
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

302
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:56,762
Goodbye.

303
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,863
It is her, right?

304
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:05,270
It is her.

305
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,117
Hey.

306
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:10,524
-You took my purse, right?
-Give me back my ring.

307
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,876
-Goodness!
-Where is she?

308
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,420
-Hey! Stop right there!
-Hey!

309
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:20,672
Stop right there!

310
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:23,049
-You!
-Stop that swindler!

311
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:25,510
-Thief!
-Hey, come back here!

312
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:29,047
-Goodness!
-Just wait until I get my hands on you!

313
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,516
-Hey! Stop!
-Wait for me!

314
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,685
-Darn it.
-Hey!

315
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,436
-Hurry up!
-What are you doing?

316
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,646
You little…

317
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,356
Catch that swindler!

318
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,566
-She got away.
-Hey.

319
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,643
-That is her, right?
-Yes.

320
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:51,327
That is Mu-deok.

321
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:52,404
Mu-deok!

322
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,335
There you are, you…

323
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:01,087
-You.
-Catch that thief!

324
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:04,215
Come here.
Wait until I get my hands on you.

325
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:05,550
Hey!

326
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:06,957
You little…

327
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,767
It was definitely her.

328
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,393
But how can she see now?

329
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,364
She had always covered her eyes with this.

330
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:44,110
Was it not her?

331
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,678
We finally meet again,

332
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:07,644
So-i.

333
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:11,074
I went all the way to Sari Village
because I heard you were there.

334
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:12,931
But you were long gone.

335
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,773
Did you think hiding
in the capital would work?

336
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,487
What is this?

337
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:23,451
Were you pretending to be blind?

338
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:28,007
But then again,
you did put up a nice, pitiful front.

339
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:31,664
Then you would betray others
behind their backs.

340
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,335
How dare you steal

341
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,594
my money?

342
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,383
I do not know what you are--

343
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,055
Jeez…

344
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:50,186
Look at you trying to deceive me again.

345
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:51,678
Take her.

346
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:57,286
Help me!

347
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,193
Somebody, please help me!

348
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:03,626
I am blind!

349
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:06,087
I do not know them,

350
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,704
yet they are trying to kidnap me!

351
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:12,885
Someone, please help me!

352
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:15,712
Look at you trying real hard.

353
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:19,433
Please help me!

354
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:20,768
What are you all looking at?

355
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:23,425
-Come here.
-Let me go!

356
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:36,642
You cannot drag her against her will.

357
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:40,288
I have a good reason for doing this,

358
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,985
so just go on your way.

359
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,375
I cannot see,

360
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:46,572
-and I do not know who they are.
-You little--

361
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,450
Get him!

362
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:04,103
He is a mage.

363
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:05,460
Let us go!

364
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:15,146
Can you stand?

365
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,787
Thank you.

366
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:23,623
They look like dangerous men.

367
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:26,070
You should ask the authorities for help.

368
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:27,710
I will take you there.

369
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:30,747
That is all right.
I do not need their help.

370
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:33,912
Your cane is broken.

371
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,503
This is an umbrella.

372
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:43,845
You can use this as a cane.

373
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:03,204
Master, it is best to just let her be.

374
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,831
She refused to be taken
to the authorities.

375
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:08,209
I do not know what kind of past she has,

376
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,206
but those were thugs.

377
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:15,035
Nothing good will come out
of involving yourself in their affairs.

378
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:25,789
I will take you there.

379
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:29,092
You should ask the authorities for help.

380
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:35,226
Maybe I should have said yes.

381
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:58,875
Number 125.

382
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,722
Did these many people
already sign up for it?

383
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:04,289
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-FIVE

384
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,208
They are only picking five people.

385
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:10,512
Do I have hope?

386
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,222
Hey, Mu-deok.

387
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:14,900
Were you here all along?

388
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,444
The young master was looking for you.

389
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,988
Did Young Master Seo come by again?

390
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,315
Not him. Young Master Jang.

391
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:24,981
Young Master Jang snuck out
and has come home.

392
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:37,780
I need to go back before sundown.
Where in the world is she?

393
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,425
Where is Young Master Jang?

394
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:23,832
He just left,
but I did not see him either.

395
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:28,425
He said he would be obedient,
so why did he escape?

396
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:32,096
I hope he does not get caught.

397
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,512
He just left.

398
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,094
Just now.

399
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,804
What is with her?

400
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,460
Jang Uk.

401
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:08,962
Young Master!

402
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:16,464
Where have you been?
I thought I would not get to see you.

403
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:47,908
I finally got to see you. I am glad.

404
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:52,961
I need to go.
They cannot know that I am gone.

405
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:56,499
Wait there. I will go to you soon.

406
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:02,234
I found a way,
so do what you need to do in there.

407
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:04,181
I will do what I can out here.

408
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:08,219
All right. But what way is that?

409
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,523
Songrim is hiring.

410
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,419
Do not get caught and get back safely.

411
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:02,503
Your Royal Highness,
instead of going to Sejukwon yourself,

412
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,740
you should summon
Master Heo to your palace.

413
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:09,385
That is all right.
It gives me a reason to come out.

414
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,122
I like taking strolls.

415
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,209
Is that not Jang Uk?

416
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:29,864
Why are you out here?

417
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,032
I heard you could not leave
the Training Center

418
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,826
until you could read Words of the Heart.

419
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:36,328
Not only did you follow me
to where I was drinking,

420
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:38,235
but you are also keeping tabs on me.

421
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,959
Why are you so interested in me?
It is making me uncomfortable.

422
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:44,206
Master Heo from Sejukwon told me.

423
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:48,632
Right. I heard you fell ill
after drinking the liquor I had given you.

424
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:51,159
Then why did you come to Sejukwon?

425
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:56,223
Does it still hurt where I hit you?

426
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:57,391
Oh, dear.

427
00:32:57,475 --> 00:33:00,561
Not at all. I am all better now.

428
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:03,258
I only go there to get some supplements.

429
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:07,511
I hope you take many good supplements.
You must live a long, healthy life.

430
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:12,277
What were you hiding just a while ago?

431
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:14,352
Let me see it.

432
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,046
It is a honey biscuit.

433
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:36,292
I wanted to eat it for myself.
How did you know?

434
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,006
You can have it.

435
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:47,431
Songrim does not have
these kinds of snacks.

436
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,008
Did you go home?

437
00:33:56,784 --> 00:34:00,067
You will be in trouble
if they find out you have sneaked out.

438
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:03,791
You even gave me a congratulatory drink
and complimented me.

439
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,988
Will you seriously tattle on me
for this little misdeed?

440
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:13,028
After all, I even gave you
that honey biscuit.

441
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:22,755
Stay away from that big pine tree.
I saw a group of mages there.

442
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,846
Thank you, Your Royal Highness. Goodbye.

443
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:34,219
I do not understand
why I am being nice to him.

444
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,269
This is tasty.

445
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,235
Is it?

446
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,037
-Is it tasty, Your Royal Highness?
-Yes.

447
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:50,574
I thought the Crown Prince

448
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:54,160
would be hostile
toward Songrim after the match.

449
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:57,249
Rather, he has sheathed his sword

450
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:00,085
and become closer to them.

451
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:03,809
He must have decided to befriend them
so that they could be of use

452
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:05,676
when he becomes the next king.

453
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:10,607
Are you sure we do not need
to do anything about it?

454
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:11,942
Do not worry.

455
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:14,139
We can easily change his mind.

456
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:17,105
We have Jang Uk's constellation plate.

457
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:22,354
The Crown Prince will have no choice
but to kill him eventually.

458
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:37,760
Is that what we will use
to subdue Jin Ho-gyeong?

459
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:41,337
Jinyowon will be ours soon.

460
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:04,559
It has been four hours
since Young Lady Heo went inside.

461
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:08,373
Do not bother them.

462
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:09,940
They must have a lot to talk about.

463
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:16,457
Hey! Wait!

464
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,551
You should not bother them.

465
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:20,803
Something is not right.

466
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:23,097
I must check whether or not
Jang Uk is in there.

467
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,544
Are you doubting my lady?

468
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:28,461
Gosh.

469
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,173
Why is he not here yet?

470
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:38,307
It will be awkward
if they find out he is not here.

471
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,322
Why are you here? What are you doing?

472
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:55,448
I told them we were in here together
so they would not catch you leaving.

473
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,372
I have been waiting for your return.

474
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:07,927
See? They are together.

475
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,303
I will go now.

476
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:14,879
I had a great chat with you today.

477
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:17,471
Likewise.

478
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,355
Goodbye.

479
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:32,108
What were you doing here
for the past four hours?

480
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:34,739
Beats me.

481
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:38,951
What were we doing here for that long?

482
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,892
She must have been bored.

483
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:09,772
You want to become a servant of Songrim?

484
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:12,247
Yes, ma'am. Look what happened today.

485
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:16,784
Young Master Jang needs me
by his side at all times.

486
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:18,574
I agree.

487
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:22,954
He must have been so uncomfortable
that he came here to bathe and eat snacks.

488
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:26,929
Our young master is very sensitive
and has been doted on growing up.

489
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:29,376
Living with others in Songrim
does not suit him.

490
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,058
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-FIVE

491
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,505
I already signed up.

492
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:34,552
I will get in at all costs.

493
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:37,469
Hey, you do not need that.

494
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,483
This is the Jang family.

495
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,180
We can easily put you in there.

496
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:42,569
Is that true?

497
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:45,656
Does that mean
I do not need to take the test?

498
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,433
Of course not. Just trust me.

499
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:53,108
That is not possible.

500
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:57,459
Songrim's servants are only chosen
through open recruitments.

501
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:58,794
There is no exception.

502
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:01,046
I am not asking you
to give her a free position.

503
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,882
She just needs the entrance plaque.
Just register her name

504
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:05,550
so she can get one.

505
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:07,547
We will pay you monthly.

506
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:12,334
Also…

507
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,043
Here.

508
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:18,716
I thought it would suit you,
so I got you one, Maidservant Park.

509
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:24,765
Here.

510
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:53,473
Word has it that you bribed

511
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:57,590
Maidservant Park of Songrim with this.

512
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:01,305
-It was purely a gift…
-I heard you asked her

513
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,401
to give Mu-deok a spot there.

514
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:07,529
Since our young master is so sensitive,

515
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:09,573
I thought having Mu-deok by his side

516
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:13,770
would help him with his training,
so I asked for a favor.

517
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:16,525
So this truly was a bribe!

518
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:21,043
I apologize. It was thoughtless of me.

519
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:23,170
When Maidservant Park brought this to me,

520
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:26,247
I vehemently told her
that you were not one to do such a thing.

521
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:28,008
I defended you.

522
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:32,095
How will I dare face her ever again?

523
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:33,582
I…

524
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:40,339
I will apologize to her.

525
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,176
What will everyone think?

526
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:46,318
They will think you abused
your relationship with me

527
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:48,278
to bribe someone.

528
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:51,823
I did give her that scarf,
but I never mentioned you to her.

529
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:53,075
Even so,

530
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,786
everyone in Songrim knows
that you and I are close.

531
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:59,693
If you do this, I can no longer…

532
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:07,111
have a close relationship with you.

533
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:12,662
In that case, I will stop coming here.

534
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:14,888
And what did you say?

535
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:18,755
Was our relationship ever that deep?

536
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:21,019
If we were truly close,

537
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:24,147
you would not have mentioned
cutting ties with me so easily.

538
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:25,724
Fine.

539
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:29,611
-Maidservant Kim, I…
-I will tell Maidservant Park

540
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:32,114
that I, who bribes people,

541
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:33,615
am not close

542
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:36,827
with the leader of Songrim even one bit.

543
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:38,354
-Look--
-All right.

544
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:40,789
I am terribly sorry

545
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:42,406
that I made you lose face.

546
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:44,778
Maidservant Kim.

547
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:48,451
You cannot just leave like that.

548
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,542
Take this.

549
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:02,002
I would be accepting this bribe
if I were to keep it.

550
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:20,690
Also…

551
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,942
I did not mean

552
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:28,628
that I did not want you to come…

553
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:29,796
Maid--

554
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,703
Maidservant Kim!

555
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,250
This is difficult.

556
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,643
You cannot do it yet.

557
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,527
Master Lee.

558
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:05,110
You cannot read that book
with the concentration you have now.

559
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:08,793
You have never trained diligently
like the others have.

560
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:11,880
How long will it take
if I start training now?

561
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:14,537
The earliest would be in a year.

562
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:18,637
I cannot do that. I refuse
to be stuck in here for that long.

563
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:22,004
I think that is exactly the reason
why Park Jin gave you that book.

564
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:28,008
You could shorten that time

565
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:32,359
if you become my pupil
and receive my teachings.

566
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:33,766
Do you mean

567
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:36,850
by drinking that chaste herb tea?

568
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,443
Please give me some time to think.

569
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:46,122
This book contains my master,

570
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:50,544
Master Seo Gyeong's poem.

571
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:51,795
Poem?

572
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:54,032
It is not that long.

573
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:57,467
Once you read the first word,

574
00:43:57,551 --> 00:43:59,664
the rest will come easily to you.

575
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:03,874
Right. You cannot read this yet, can you?

576
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:07,727
Are you having fun teasing me?
It is not like you will tell me.

577
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,254
It is quite entertaining to watch.

578
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:13,759
Shall I help you again this time?

579
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:16,469
Yes, please.

580
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:20,770
Let me tell you one secret
about this book that no one knows of.

581
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:25,652
This poem is actually a love letter.

582
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:28,456
A love letter?

583
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:29,583
That is right.

584
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:33,740
Countless mages have read this,
but no one knows that fact.

585
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:41,553
Master Seo Gyeong wrote this
for a lady who could not see

586
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:44,620
so that she could read it with her heart.

587
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:52,314
You can read it by training
your concentration skills.

588
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:56,551
But try to think of another way
since I told you it was a love letter.

589
00:44:57,986 --> 00:45:01,849
How does a love letter begin?

590
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:10,269
What is this?

591
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:14,377
Was he a pervert?

592
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:18,204
Why would he make others
read his love letter?

593
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:21,412
Why must I read this?
It is invisible to me.

594
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:23,797
Was he really a pervert?

595
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:31,019
Master Lee, it is getting colder now.
Instead of returning to Danhyanggok,

596
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:34,386
how about you stay here?
I will treat you well.

597
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:36,024
Yeom.

598
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:40,820
I cannot train by wearing warm clothes
and feeling comfortable.

599
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:45,237
I am just a pupil
who wants his master to be warm.

600
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:51,695
I guess you have matured with age.

601
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,293
That is Maidservant Kim
from the Jang family.

602
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:15,881
Seeing how she looks unhappy,
she must have fought with Jin again.

603
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:19,265
Goodness. Hello.

604
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:25,058
Master Lee.

605
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:28,159
Why did you leave so quickly last time?

606
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:29,953
I did not have the chance to thank you.

607
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:33,400
Have you two met before?

608
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:36,747
We met at the party in Chwiseonru.

609
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:39,170
How are your clothes?

610
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:41,627
I made your seam run.

611
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:44,121
I am fine.

612
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:45,718
Seam?

613
00:46:45,802 --> 00:46:47,255
I see.

614
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:48,805
It is very cold.

615
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:50,922
Do you not feel cold in those clothes?

616
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:54,060
Wear this.

617
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:56,677
I wanted to get you a thank-you gift.

618
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:02,841
This is a gift, not a bribe.

619
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:04,551
Here.

620
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,623
It suits you.

621
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:38,670
Will you be all right wearing that?

622
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:51,447
SONGRIM SERVANT CONTEST

623
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:55,657
We will now begin

624
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:58,750
the Songrim Servant Contest

625
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:02,907
and pick those of you
who will work in Songrim.

626
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:05,741
I will read the name list.

627
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,703
Answer me when I call your names.

628
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,673
Number one, Park Jun-hwa.

629
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:14,974
Here.

630
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:16,976
Number two, An So-jeong.

631
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,303
Here!

632
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:21,022
An So-jeong.

633
00:48:21,106 --> 00:48:22,357
TWO

634
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:23,594
An…

635
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:27,445
-Number three, Lee Yeong-ok.
-Here.

636
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:29,562
-Number four, Park Hyeon-su.
-Here.

637
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:32,850
-Number five, Bae Hui-young.
-Here.

638
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,167
What is this?

639
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:42,904
I am looking at it just in case.

640
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:49,031
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-FIVE, MU-DEOK

641
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:51,886
There you are.

642
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:55,003
Number 125, Mu-deok.

643
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:57,459
Over here!

644
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:06,554
Your maid, Mu-deok, is in Songrim today.

645
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:09,362
Let me warn you in advance.

646
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:10,947
Do not try to leave this room.

647
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:12,564
Can you keep it down…

648
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:16,828
Could you be quiet, please?

649
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:19,372
I need all the concentration
I can get to read this.

650
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:21,019
I will let you be then.

651
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:38,141
I will see you again in three days,
Your Royal Highness.

652
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:42,208
Why is Songrim so busy today?
It is teeming with people.

653
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:47,299
They are holding a contest
to pick out some servants.

654
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:50,761
-Do they need to turn it into a contest?
-Your Royal Highness.

655
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:53,489
Many people
want to work here as a servant.

656
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:56,856
I saw the maid from the Jang family too.

657
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:00,311
-Filthy Mu-deok?
-Yes, Your Royal Highness.

658
00:50:13,468 --> 00:50:15,251
Your first test

659
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:20,382
will require you to read and calculate.

660
00:50:21,017 --> 00:50:22,727
You must get all of them right.

661
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:25,634
One wrong answer,
and you will be disqualified!

662
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:31,050
SONGRIM SERVANT CONTEST

663
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:35,892
Yul!

664
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:39,559
I found the test papers.

665
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:43,982
There are many questions.
Even short-answer ones.

666
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:45,958
Mu-deok is smart,

667
00:50:46,042 --> 00:50:47,695
but will she get them all right?

668
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:52,131
This is pretty difficult?

669
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:55,009
Eunuch Oh, what do you need
to wash clothes that have ink on them?

670
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:56,219
That is a question here.

671
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:58,836
Rice paste does the trick.

672
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:00,556
What do you do with it?

673
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,633
First, you apply it on…

674
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,607
SONGRIM SERVANT CONTEST

675
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:12,694
"You invited 20 individuals each
from 3 different families."

676
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:16,311
"One table can seat four people.
How many tables do you need?"

677
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:21,729
Twenty individuals from three families
mean sixty in total.

678
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:27,446
Since one table can fit four of them,

679
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:29,571
-it is fifteen.
-No.

680
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:32,530
They said "three families" on purpose.

681
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:37,491
Those from the same family
must sit together.

682
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:40,388
We need more tables
if they will be placed together.

683
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:42,925
Each family would need nine tables.

684
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:45,749
That is 27 in total.

685
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:53,484
This was an invitation.

686
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:55,111
NINE × THREE = TWENTY-SEVEN

687
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:58,008
The host needs a table as well.

688
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:00,158
TWENTY-SEVEN + HOST
= TWENTY…

689
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:01,895
Twenty-eight in total.

690
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:06,485
You are right.

691
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:09,110
TWENTY-EIGHT

692
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:12,362
Next question is about running errands
and not getting lost.

693
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:15,537
Let me get a map of the capital.

694
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:18,956
HOW DO YOU WASH CLOTHES
THAT HAVE INK ON THEM?

695
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:21,763
What should you do
if there is ink on the clothes?

696
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:24,620
Should you not just dispose of them?
Eunuch Oh.

697
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:26,642
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

698
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:29,729
How do you wash clothes
that have ink on them again?

699
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:31,898
You need some warm rice paste.

700
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:34,015
-Smear it on the--
-That is right.

701
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,338
Write it.

702
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,970
"Warm rice paste."

SONGRIM SERVANT CONTEST

704
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:45,286
We probably got all of them right.

705
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:47,653
I did not expect to do this with you,
but it was fun.

706
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:50,616
I can assure you that Mu-deok will fail.

707
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:59,411
That is why we should deliver
this perfect test paper to her.

708
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:04,413
But how can we do that?
It will look too obvious if we do it.

709
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:09,708
Perhaps someone who is more conspicuous
will avoid suspicion.

710
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:28,275
SONGRIM SERVANT CONTEST

711
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:30,819
This is hard.

712
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:33,194
This is more difficult than I thought.

713
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:37,319
Do not look at other people's papers.

714
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:43,831
The Crown Prince is here! Bow before him!

715
00:53:47,098 --> 00:53:48,599
Goodness. Your Royal Highness!

716
00:53:48,683 --> 00:53:51,886
-Your Royal Highness!
-Your Royal Highness!

717
00:53:57,776 --> 00:54:01,259
I heard there was an important test,
so I wanted to encourage you.

718
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:04,699
We are honored to have you here.

719
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:08,026
Do not mind me and focus on the test.

720
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:26,960
Focus!

721
00:54:28,264 --> 00:54:29,757
Focus!

722
00:54:30,183 --> 00:54:31,392
Focus!

723
00:54:31,476 --> 00:54:32,959
-You too.
-Focus--

724
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:34,676
Get back to what you were doing.

725
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:20,801
I will now announce
those of you who have passed.

726
00:55:23,361 --> 00:55:26,474
Park Jun-hwa, you have passed.

727
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:29,325
Lee Yeong-ok, failed.

728
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:32,652
Hwang Yeon-ji, failed.

729
00:55:33,329 --> 00:55:35,522
Oh Jae-ho, you have passed.

730
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:39,543
Number 125.

731
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:41,110
Mu-deok.

732
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:52,503
Your Royal Highness!

733
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:56,143
She got in!

734
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:57,920
Yes!

735
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:03,428
Good work.

736
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:08,197
Forty of you have passed the first test.

737
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:11,984
Now comes the practical test.

738
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:18,862
The practical test
will evaluate them on their duties.

739
00:56:19,584 --> 00:56:20,918
They will prepare ingredients,

740
00:56:21,002 --> 00:56:23,838
clean, and wash clothes.

741
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:26,535
Lastly, there will be a fitness test.

742
00:56:55,703 --> 00:56:58,330
Number 125, Mu-deok.

743
00:56:58,414 --> 00:56:59,987
You have passed.

744
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:30,946
Number 125, Mu-deok.

745
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:32,103
You have passed!

746
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:36,316
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-FIVE

747
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,993
Number 125, Mu-deok.

748
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:50,833
You have passed!

749
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:56,514
Gosh, Mu-deok is impressive.

750
00:57:56,598 --> 00:57:58,391
Now, it is the fitness test.

751
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:00,538
We should go and cheer for her.

752
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:04,063
I saw many fit individuals back there.

753
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:06,399
I highly doubt she will be
one of the last five.

754
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,896
Your Royal Highness,
thank you for helping us.

755
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:10,432
Goodbye.

756
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:14,855
-Let us go.
-All right.

757
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:21,163
That was his way of telling me
not to come, right?

758
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:23,666
Goodness, why did they have to be so mean?

759
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:26,033
Unbelievable.

760
00:58:26,794 --> 00:58:28,537
Forget it. Let us go.

761
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,625
Your Royal Highness, it is this way.

762
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:35,621
-I know.
-Of course, Your Royal Highness.

763
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:40,891
You will travel five ri
and bring back some water.

764
00:58:40,975 --> 00:58:42,588
Those who are the first five

765
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:46,555
to arrive will be the final winners.

766
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:49,052
This is the last hurdle.

767
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:52,262
I must be in the first five.

768
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:05,273
Go!

769
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:16,989
He has been looking
at Words of the Heart for days on end.

770
00:59:18,596 --> 00:59:19,869
Is that so?

771
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:29,982
It will not happen that soon.

772
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:31,679
Have patience.

773
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:35,179
Yes, my lord.

774
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:39,181
Maidservant Kim is worried sick about you.

775
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:41,702
Let me know if you need anything.

776
00:59:41,786 --> 00:59:46,109
I will prepare your bed, food,
and clothes to your liking.

777
00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:49,365
I am fine.

778
00:59:58,386 --> 01:00:00,721
The wind is getting chillier now.

779
01:00:00,805 --> 01:00:03,368
Keep the windows closed.

780
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:08,938
Master Seo Gyeong wrote this
for a lady who could not see

781
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:12,135
so that she could read it with her heart.

782
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,393
I have one question.

783
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:20,354
Did Master Seo Gyeong know
of a woman who could not see?

784
01:00:24,078 --> 01:00:26,611
During the Great Chaos
that occurred 200 years ago,

785
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:29,375
the first leader of Jinyowon

786
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:31,835
was the one who helped
Master Seo Gyeong by his side.

787
01:00:31,919 --> 01:00:35,032
And she could not see.

788
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:39,993
He had written this love letter
for the leader of Jinyowon.

789
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:45,964
By the way, are you sure
you can let others read this?

790
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:48,602
What if these are his private thoughts

791
01:00:48,686 --> 01:00:50,919
that you are making everyone read?

792
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:57,970
You must be trying to use me
to read what is written in there.

793
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:00,281
I will tell you this.

794
01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:05,558
Those words have nothing to do
with his private thoughts.

795
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:12,367
Countless mages have read this,
but no one knows that fact.

796
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:15,629
Right. No one knows
that it is a love letter.

797
01:01:15,713 --> 01:01:17,673
Instead of coming up with tricks,

798
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:20,370
you should focus more
on training yourself.

799
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:24,373
How could no one know
that this is a love letter?

800
01:01:29,143 --> 01:01:32,479
You can read it by training
your concentration skills.

801
01:01:32,563 --> 01:01:37,306
But try to think of another way
since I told you it was a love letter.

802
01:01:37,985 --> 01:01:41,808
There must be a different way
to read this love letter.

803
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:44,867
Those who read this
through training do not know.

804
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:47,604
Only those who are aware
that it is a love letter can read it.

805
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:49,413
But how?

806
01:01:49,497 --> 01:01:52,820
How does a love letter begin?

807
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,293
I have one last question.

808
01:02:06,097 --> 01:02:07,920
What was the name

809
01:02:08,766 --> 01:02:10,459
of the first leader of Jinyowon?

810
01:02:22,613 --> 01:02:24,686
All love letters begin

811
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:28,025
with the recipient's name.

812
01:02:28,786 --> 01:02:30,059
Her surname

813
01:02:30,496 --> 01:02:33,819
was Jin, and her first name was Seol-ran.

814
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:37,002
The recipient's name was Seol-ran.

815
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:38,859
"An orchid that blooms

816
01:02:39,881 --> 01:02:41,324
in the white snow."

817
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:44,122
Her name

818
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:47,201
will open this letter.

819
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:19,997
YOU CANNOT GRASP WATER
BUT IT IS INSIDE THE SOIL

820
01:03:25,551 --> 01:03:26,914
I can read it.

821
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:37,089
Hey, there she is.

822
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,723
There is Mu-deok.

823
01:03:55,122 --> 01:03:56,825
"You cannot grasp water,

824
01:03:58,167 --> 01:03:59,860
but it is inside the soil."

825
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:03,547
"You cannot touch fire,

826
01:04:03,631 --> 01:04:05,204
but it is inside the tree."

827
01:04:07,385 --> 01:04:09,408
"You cannot hold the wind,

828
01:04:10,888 --> 01:04:12,501
but it is resting on the rock."

829
01:04:14,058 --> 01:04:17,961
"If you let them be,
they will exist everywhere."

830
01:04:19,605 --> 01:04:21,168
"The faint, blue light

831
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:24,185
makes me sigh."

832
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:29,186
"My white breath

833
01:04:29,615 --> 01:04:31,978
turned into snow and tears."

834
01:04:32,952 --> 01:04:35,905
"I could not let them drop and hid them."

835
01:04:37,331 --> 01:04:40,234
"Despite knowing that
they will fill up once again,

836
01:04:40,793 --> 01:04:45,286
I am a fool
who dares not shed a single tear."

837
01:04:50,428 --> 01:04:52,201
Those two are already back.

838
01:04:54,682 --> 01:04:56,045
I do not see Mu-deok.

839
01:05:04,483 --> 01:05:06,568
There are six people in front of Mu-deok.

840
01:05:06,652 --> 01:05:09,015
She needs to beat
at least two of them to win.

841
01:05:19,332 --> 01:05:22,575
I AM A FOOL
WHO DARES NOT SHED A SINGLE TEAR

842
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:32,080
YOU CANNOT GRASP WATER
BUT IT IS INSIDE THE SOIL

843
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:39,792
Where are you going?

844
01:05:40,686 --> 01:05:41,999
Right.

845
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:45,548
I read it.

846
01:06:07,838 --> 01:06:08,839
Number 29,

847
01:06:08,923 --> 01:06:10,956
Jang Jeong-do. You have passed.

848
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:14,164
Only one more remains.

849
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:49,246
I do not need a pupil
who does not improve.

850
01:06:49,588 --> 01:06:51,821
Just die if you are
not going to do anything.

851
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:54,718
Hey! That is dangerous!

852
01:06:54,802 --> 01:06:56,665
You are no longer Naksu.

853
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:05,298
No matter how pathetic you feel,

854
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:08,473
you must do what you can at the moment.

855
01:07:10,776 --> 01:07:12,799
If I am not willing to do anything,

856
01:07:14,238 --> 01:07:15,851
I might as well just die.

857
01:07:35,176 --> 01:07:37,199
Number 125, Mu-deok.

858
01:07:39,472 --> 01:07:40,965
You have passed!

859
01:07:48,355 --> 01:07:49,940
YOU CANNOT GRASP WATER
BUT IT IS INSIDE THE SOIL

860
01:07:50,024 --> 01:07:52,977
It is exactly identical
to Words of the Heart.

861
01:07:53,527 --> 01:07:55,600
Jang Uk accomplished the task.

862
01:07:57,865 --> 01:07:59,478
He accomplished the task?

863
01:08:04,163 --> 01:08:07,332
-Where is he right now?
-He is at Sejukwon.

864
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:10,711
The maid who was always with him
collapsed while taking the test,

865
01:08:10,795 --> 01:08:12,148
so he took her there.

866
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:14,495
His maid?

867
01:08:15,007 --> 01:08:16,967
-Do you mean Mu-deok?
-Yes, my lord.

868
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:19,164
She passed the test today.

869
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:21,930
She did pass out at the finish line,

870
01:08:22,014 --> 01:08:24,217
but she did indeed make it.

871
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:26,170
Is that so?

872
01:08:30,314 --> 01:08:33,807
My maid only risked her life
by doing what she was told to do.

873
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:35,893
It was all my doing.

874
01:08:48,749 --> 01:08:50,232
Now that I think of it,

875
01:08:51,836 --> 01:08:54,149
she was always beside Uk.

876
01:08:56,048 --> 01:08:57,871
His maid, Mu-deok…

877
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:07,499
The book that I read was actually
Master Seo Gyeong's love letter.

878
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:11,459
Really?

879
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:14,381
Then why did he make it invisible?

880
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:18,727
The woman could not see.
He wanted her to read with her heart.

881
01:09:19,947 --> 01:09:21,560
How wistful.

882
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:23,274
I do not think

883
01:09:23,951 --> 01:09:25,854
the letter was sent.

884
01:09:26,453 --> 01:09:28,696
If it was, it would have been in Jinyowon,

885
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:31,033
not Songrim.

886
01:09:31,458 --> 01:09:34,781
An invisible love letter
that was never sent?

887
01:09:36,755 --> 01:09:37,988
What a coward.

888
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:42,293
He wrote down his feelings
without her knowing.

889
01:09:43,637 --> 01:09:45,160
What a foolish

890
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:48,041
and pitiful love letter.

891
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:55,595
You are right. He should have…

892
01:09:58,527 --> 01:10:00,510
delivered the letter like you did.

893
01:10:01,822 --> 01:10:04,605
RECRUITING SERVANTS FOR SONGRIM

894
01:10:05,826 --> 01:10:07,285
That is not a letter.

895
01:10:07,369 --> 01:10:08,745
What is there to a letter?

896
01:10:08,829 --> 01:10:11,692
As long as it delivers your feelings.

897
01:10:13,083 --> 01:10:15,585
Wait there. I will go to you soon.

898
01:10:15,669 --> 01:10:17,572
Do not get caught and get back safely.

899
01:10:26,805 --> 01:10:31,128
You must have pitied me
for trying to get in here as a servant.

900
01:10:31,977 --> 01:10:34,760
You used to be
an incredibly experienced master.

901
01:10:35,105 --> 01:10:37,048
I did feel bad for you.

902
01:10:37,858 --> 01:10:40,360
I guess I helped you learn
about loyalty and duties.

903
01:10:40,444 --> 01:10:42,487
Seeing how far you would go as my master,

904
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:46,104
I did think that I should do my best.

905
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:50,107
You must have felt pressured.

906
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:53,689
Not really. But I was in a dilemma.

907
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:59,246
I did not know if I should reply
as your young master or pupil.

908
01:10:59,672 --> 01:11:02,575
Or just reply based on what I read.

909
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:09,967
What did you read?

910
01:11:10,724 --> 01:11:14,597
Then should I also reply
based on what I read?

911
01:11:16,063 --> 01:11:17,766
Also? What do you mean?

912
01:11:18,148 --> 01:11:22,431
It is written here.
"I will go this far just to see you."

913
01:11:22,987 --> 01:11:26,430
"I can do anything
if it means being able to see you."

914
01:11:26,907 --> 01:11:28,430
And this is my reply.

915
01:11:33,414 --> 01:11:38,037
I should have braced myself
before letting him get this close to me.

916
01:11:42,006 --> 01:11:43,659
I also missed you.

917
01:11:47,428 --> 01:11:48,911
That is my reply.

918
01:11:57,938 --> 01:11:59,881
What I gave him

919
01:12:01,275 --> 01:12:05,428
should not have been read
or delivered in the first place.

920
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:08,929
It was my foolish and pathetic

921
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:12,309
love letter.

922
01:12:43,567 --> 01:12:45,193
I miss you first thing in the morning,

923
01:12:45,277 --> 01:12:47,195
-all throughout the day--
-Stop.

924
01:12:47,279 --> 01:12:49,364
It is a terrible poison you cannot escape,

925
01:12:49,448 --> 01:12:51,408
as its only antidote is
the person it is from.

926
01:12:51,492 --> 01:12:52,867
Are you out of your mind?

927
01:12:52,951 --> 01:12:54,828
This is just a symptom.
I have been poisoned.

928
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:58,039
So the only one in your mind
has been Jang Uk, Naksu.

929
01:12:58,123 --> 01:13:00,250
You did not believe me
when I said I was in love with you.

930
01:13:00,334 --> 01:13:02,294
Then do a better job
and make me believe it.

931
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:04,838
That is the most precious object
I have ever received.

932
01:13:04,922 --> 01:13:07,841
Please do your best
so you can win it back.

933
01:13:07,925 --> 01:13:10,719
I have made a bet with your maid, Mu-deok.

934
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:13,013
Fight and perish, Jang Uk.

935
01:13:13,097 --> 01:13:14,180
When I said I missed you,

936
01:13:14,264 --> 01:13:16,114
is this what you meant
when you said you had my weakness?

937
01:13:16,199 --> 01:13:17,682
Do not go.

938
01:13:17,768 --> 01:13:21,551
I like Mu-deok a lot.

939
01:13:25,025 --> 01:13:30,178
