1,12,1,00:01:10:19,00:01:13:04,"People would wonder
if you suddenly disappeared."
1,12,2,00:01:13:07,00:01:15:12,Letting others witness you dying in public
1,12,3,00:01:15:14,00:01:17:19,will make things much easier.
1,12,4,00:01:19:22,00:01:21:16,I would still like to save face.
1,12,5,00:01:22:16,00:01:24:15,I hope it will not be a disgraceful death.
1,12,6,00:01:29:17,00:01:31:22,"-Master!
-My lord!"
1,12,7,00:01:35:06,00:01:36:08,What is he saying?
1,12,8,00:01:36:10,00:01:38:08,"-What happened?
-Look!"
1,12,9,00:01:39:01,00:01:40:23,Assassins!
1,12,10,00:02:10:11,00:02:12:10,Master!
1,12,11,00:02:21:02,00:02:24:07,I will be sure to use your body well.
1,12,12,00:03:17:23,00:03:18:20,Young Master.
1,12,13,00:03:22:01,00:03:24:06,"Darn it, Uk."
1,12,14,00:03:30:20,00:03:31:24,That is fine.
1,12,15,00:03:32:24,00:03:33:24,Do not come in.
1,12,16,00:03:38:21,00:03:39:19,What a shame.
1,12,17,00:03:39:21,00:03:42:11,Uk landed more blows this time.
1,12,18,00:03:42:13,00:03:44:20,"-Are there two more left?
-Yes."
1,12,19,00:03:46:04,00:03:48:11,Cha Beom will be up against him tomorrow.
1,12,20,00:03:48:12,00:03:50:12,"Darn it. I would hate
to see Uk lose to him."
1,12,21,00:03:51:04,00:03:52:14,Should I go instead?
1,12,22,00:03:53:06,00:03:55:06,"If I let Uk win,
then this will all be over."
1,12,23,00:03:55:07,00:03:56:19,I doubt that will make Uk happy.
1,12,24,00:03:57:06,00:03:59:08,This is a bet against the Crown Prince.
1,12,25,00:03:59:11,00:04:01:00,It will simply be outsmarting him.
1,12,26,00:04:04:05,00:04:06:03,"Uk may be losing, but he is improving."
1,12,27,00:04:08:05,00:04:09:05,Young Master.
1,12,28,00:04:09:07,00:04:11:24,Go to your room. Let me bring you a towel.
1,12,29,00:04:20:02,00:04:22:22,"I do not know
who the last contender will be."
1,12,30,00:04:24:22,00:04:26:21,But Uk will not be defeated that easily.
1,12,31,00:04:41:08,00:04:42:08,Uk!
1,12,32,00:04:46:13,00:04:47:19,Where is Young Master Jang?
1,12,33,00:04:48:09,00:04:49:21,You must be here for your young master.
1,12,34,00:04:50:16,00:04:51:16,"Yes, my lady."
1,12,35,00:04:52:11,00:04:54:05,You must be Mu-deok.
1,12,36,00:04:55:10,00:04:57:14,"-Yes, my lady.
-I see."
1,12,37,00:04:57:16,00:05:00:15,"You are the one
who is always by Young Master Jang's side."
1,12,38,00:05:01:05,00:05:04:10,"She must be the egret
that Maidservant Kim mentioned."
1,12,39,00:05:04:23,00:05:07:19,I am here to see him before I leave.
1,12,40,00:05:07:21,00:05:09:06,Come in. Right.
1,12,41,00:05:09:08,00:05:12:07,"I even brought some snacks.
Would you like some?"
1,12,42,00:05:13:03,00:05:14:03,"No, thank you."
1,12,43,00:05:22:16,00:05:25:19,"She is sophisticated and polite
just like Maidservant Kim said."
1,12,44,00:06:26:00,00:06:28:07,"Why are you still drenched
and standing there?"
1,12,45,00:06:30:07,00:06:31:16,"Hey, look."
1,12,46,00:06:49:11,00:06:51:02,"This is what that guy did, right?"
1,12,47,00:06:51:16,00:06:53:20,I should try it again with my sword.
1,12,48,00:06:54:18,00:06:57:15,"I thought you were dispirited
after being thrown into the lake."
1,12,49,00:06:58:12,00:07:00:10,But you were just reviewing your fight.
1,12,50,00:07:00:23,00:07:03:19,"I was downcast and embarrassed
the first couple of times."
1,12,51,00:07:03:21,00:07:05:21,"I am just mad
that I have lost eight times."
1,12,52,00:07:07:23,00:07:11:09,"You used to only wear
neatly-ironed clothes."
1,12,53,00:07:11:11,00:07:14:08,"Seeing how you are still
in those filthy, wet ones"
1,12,54,00:07:15:11,00:07:16:21,proves what you just said.
1,12,55,00:07:20:02,00:07:21:16,I am truly dirty.
1,12,56,00:07:26:20,00:07:28:20,You rushed yourself today.
1,12,57,00:07:28:22,00:07:32:05,"You should not have charged at him
when he was in defense."
1,12,58,00:07:32:08,00:07:35:07,"You should have waited for him
to put his guard down."
1,12,59,00:07:36:08,00:07:37:12,Right.
1,12,60,00:07:37:14,00:07:40:08,"Had you suddenly taken a step back
after landing those blows,"
1,12,61,00:07:40:10,00:07:43:19,"he would have been relieved,
stopped defending,"
1,12,62,00:07:43:22,00:07:45:08,and let down his guard.
1,12,63,00:07:46:02,00:07:48:03,Fighting is like a game of tug-of-war.
1,12,64,00:07:48:18,00:07:51:12,"Your opponent will pull
if you feign letting your guard down."
1,12,65,00:07:52:17,00:07:54:16,That is when you should strike.
1,12,66,00:07:56:07,00:07:58:03,"Thank you for your advice, master."
1,12,67,00:08:03:14,00:08:04:13,Where are you going?
1,12,68,00:08:06:01,00:08:08:01,I should bathe and get changed.
1,12,69,00:08:08:03,00:08:09:19,I think I am reeking as well.
1,12,70,00:08:11:04,00:08:13:09,You must be here for your young master.
1,12,71,00:08:20:22,00:08:22:05,Do not go.
1,12,72,00:08:25:22,00:08:27:22,Do not go to your room and just stay here.
1,12,73,00:08:28:18,00:08:31:07,"-I will bring you your clothes.
-What for?"
1,12,74,00:08:31:09,00:08:33:05,I can go get changed.
1,12,75,00:08:34:04,00:08:35:23,"Why would you be a fool
and tire yourself out?"
1,12,76,00:08:41:07,00:08:42:10,You are right.
1,12,77,00:08:44:12,00:08:46:02,I am just being a fool.
1,12,78,00:08:50:12,00:08:51:10,You may go.
1,12,79,00:08:56:01,00:08:57:02,Mu-deok.
1,12,80,00:08:57:05,00:08:58:15,Stop there.
1,12,81,00:09:00:11,00:09:01:12,What is it?
1,12,82,00:09:08:14,00:09:09:18,Sit down.
1,12,83,00:09:10:14,00:09:11:19,Come on.
1,12,84,00:09:17:17,00:09:19:21,"Goodness, look at your shoes.
They are drenched."
1,12,85,00:09:23:03,00:09:23:24,Why…
1,12,86,00:09:25:05,00:09:27:23,"Why would you follow me
and try to jump into the water?"
1,12,87,00:09:30:20,00:09:35:00,"You see, there are times
when you are unnecessarily hard-working."
1,12,88,00:09:35:02,00:09:37:18,Why do you put your heart into cleaning?
1,12,89,00:09:37:20,00:09:40:04,Just use me as your excuse and rest up.
1,12,90,00:09:42:11,00:09:45:10,"Maidservant Kim sent
some abalones and dried yellow corvina."
1,12,91,00:09:45:12,00:09:48:09,"You should have some yourself.
Do not give them all to me."
1,12,92,00:09:49:16,00:09:50:22,Do not worry.
1,12,93,00:09:52:24,00:09:55:16,"Everyone treats me well
since I am close with Dang-gu,"
1,12,94,00:09:55:19,00:09:57:04,the heir of Songrim.
1,12,95,00:09:59:06,00:10:00:09,That is what I thought.
1,12,96,00:10:01:12,00:10:05:15,"I knew you would use
your power to your advantage."
1,12,97,00:10:12:16,00:10:14:01,You are injured.
1,12,98,00:10:16:12,00:10:18:09,I fought for eight days on end.
1,12,99,00:10:19:11,00:10:20:21,This is not my only wound.
1,12,100,00:10:23:09,00:10:24:18,Then where else?
1,12,101,00:10:25:14,00:10:27:12,Let us go to Sejukwon and get you treated.
1,12,102,00:10:27:14,00:10:29:04,I still have more fights left.
1,12,103,00:10:31:15,00:10:33:11,"I should get injured as much as I can,"
1,12,104,00:10:34:19,00:10:36:13,as much as my master expects of me.
1,12,105,00:10:52:21,00:10:54:06,Your feet will freeze.
1,12,106,00:10:55:09,00:10:56:19,You should get changed too.
1,12,107,00:11:38:13,00:11:39:16,Maidservant Kim?
1,12,108,00:11:53:13,00:11:55:06,"You are ready, Your Royal Highness."
1,12,109,00:11:55:08,00:11:58:08,"The medicine does not stop being bitter.
Do you have anything sweet?"
1,12,110,00:11:58:10,00:12:00:14,I will prepare the sweetest snack.
1,12,111,00:12:11:08,00:12:13:14,"There should be a red jade
that goes with it."
1,12,112,00:12:14:11,00:12:16:12,"They are only valuable
when they are together."
1,12,113,00:12:18:04,00:12:19:20,Should I just throw this away?
1,12,114,00:12:59:05,00:13:00:14,What?
1,12,115,00:13:01:03,00:13:02:08,What is wrong with this?
1,12,116,00:13:10:21,00:13:13:00,What could this be?
1,12,117,00:13:25:05,00:13:29:16,Someone is pulling me in with great force.
1,12,118,00:13:33:11,00:13:35:02,This inexplainable attraction…
1,12,119,00:13:36:05,00:13:37:04,It is calling to me.
1,12,120,00:14:29:13,00:14:31:00,"-Damn it.
-Damn it!"
1,12,121,00:14:31:03,00:14:33:11,Why would you fill her jade with energy
1,12,122,00:14:33:13,00:14:35:13,and confuse me like that?
1,12,123,00:14:35:15,00:14:37:12,This greatly offends me.
1,12,124,00:14:37:14,00:14:38:10,Likewise.
1,12,125,00:14:38:12,00:14:43:01,"I am truly offended that
you were the reason why my heart raced."
1,12,126,00:14:44:08,00:14:45:08,Darn it.
1,12,127,00:14:47:22,00:14:48:23,"By the way,"
1,12,128,00:14:49:24,00:14:51:03,did you feel it too?
1,12,129,00:14:52:12,00:14:55:23,Did your heart thump…
1,12,130,00:14:58:14,00:15:00:08,"-Darn it.
-Do not say that."
1,12,131,00:15:03:00,00:15:04:03,Forget it.
1,12,132,00:15:04:23,00:15:06:03,"Seeing how surprised you are,"
1,12,133,00:15:06:24,00:15:09:00,I guess you have never used this properly.
1,12,134,00:15:09:21,00:15:10:19,Right.
1,12,135,00:15:10:21,00:15:12:10,"Since Mu-deok does not know magic,"
1,12,136,00:15:13:01,00:15:14:17,"I doubt you two were able
to share your energy."
1,12,137,00:15:14:19,00:15:15:21,You are right.
1,12,138,00:15:16:10,00:15:19:01,I did not know this jade had such power.
1,12,139,00:15:34:17,00:15:36:09,That is enough!
1,12,140,00:15:37:19,00:15:39:19,"-Darn it.
-Anyway, I learned something new"
1,12,141,00:15:40:14,00:15:42:01,because of you.
1,12,142,00:15:42:22,00:15:44:20,"-Thank you.
-What is it?"
1,12,143,00:15:44:22,00:15:45:24,Are you planning to use it?
1,12,144,00:15:47:00,00:15:48:08,I doubt you will be able to.
1,12,145,00:15:49:19,00:15:51:04,Mu-deok will not get this back.
1,12,146,00:15:51:06,00:15:53:05,I still have two matches left.
1,12,147,00:15:53:18,00:15:55:19,I will get it back and put it to good use.
1,12,148,00:15:55:21,00:15:57:20,So please keep it safe until then.
1,12,149,00:15:59:08,00:16:00:20,And please do not ever
1,12,150,00:16:01:12,00:16:02:23,fill it with your energy again.
1,12,151,00:16:04:22,00:16:06:10,The same goes for you.
1,12,152,00:16:11:20,00:16:14:04,"Your Royal Highness, where have you been?"
1,12,153,00:16:15:14,00:16:16:19,Should I take you in?
1,12,154,00:16:18:06,00:16:19:07,I can do that.
1,12,155,00:16:19:23,00:16:22:05,There must be things you can do here too.
1,12,156,00:16:23:16,00:16:24:19,"No, thank you."
1,12,157,00:16:25:21,00:16:27:17,"-Eunuch Oh.
-Yes, Your Royal Highness."
1,12,158,00:16:27:19,00:16:30:17,Find out who will be up against Uk next.
1,12,159,00:16:31:07,00:16:32:06,"Yes, Your Royal Highness."
1,12,160,00:16:32:21,00:16:34:00,You better be right.
1,12,161,00:16:34:17,00:16:35:21,THE ART OF HYEONGONG
1,12,162,00:16:35:23,00:16:36:20,Hey.
1,12,163,00:16:36:22,00:16:38:20,How was Jang Uk?
1,12,164,00:16:38:22,00:16:42:01,Jang Uk? It was a cakewalk to beat him.
1,12,165,00:16:42:24,00:16:45:04,"-Are you ready for your match?
-Of course."
1,12,166,00:16:45:06,00:16:47:18,"At the very end, I will use Hyeongong to…"
1,12,167,00:16:51:09,00:16:54:01,"He is a mage from the Cha family
who can use Hyeongong."
1,12,168,00:16:54:18,00:16:56:19,He had been watching Uk all along.
1,12,169,00:16:56:21,00:17:00:17,"He is a coward who has only stepped up
after seeing Uk lose several times."
1,12,170,00:17:01:14,00:17:03:12,Uk might be able to beat him.
1,12,171,00:17:07:02,00:17:10:03,"Hyeongong is a spell that
may look fancy on the outside."
1,12,172,00:17:10:20,00:17:13:05,"But it will be useless
if the user lacks the skills."
1,12,173,00:17:14:02,00:17:16:03,"Beom may look intimidating
at first glance,"
1,12,174,00:17:16:06,00:17:17:16,but that could just be a front.
1,12,175,00:17:18:17,00:17:21:04,Yul sure can see through others.
1,12,176,00:17:21:16,00:17:22:18,Is that so?
1,12,177,00:17:23:07,00:17:25:16,"But he was telling others
about how easy it would be"
1,12,178,00:17:26:05,00:17:27:24,to beat Young Master Jang.
1,12,179,00:17:28:01,00:17:29:03,He is just worried.
1,12,180,00:17:30:00,00:17:32:10,"Uk has improved greatly
in the past several days."
1,12,181,00:17:33:01,00:17:35:16,He is scared that Uk will beat him.
1,12,182,00:17:36:21,00:17:41:02,"I guess my young master has improved
quite a bit for him to be worried."
1,12,183,00:17:43:21,00:17:46:02,"Are you that thrilled
that Uk has become stronger?"
1,12,184,00:17:46:04,00:17:49:02,Of course. I cannot be any prouder.
1,12,185,00:17:50:13,00:17:53:12,Naksu is training Uk.
1,12,186,00:17:53:14,00:17:54:16,Yul.
1,12,187,00:17:57:13,00:17:58:22,Did you hear?
1,12,188,00:17:58:24,00:18:00:17,There is a commotion in the capital.
1,12,189,00:18:01:14,00:18:02:18,What happened?
1,12,190,00:18:02:20,00:18:06:11,"Master Kang from Daegangtongun
succumbed to his illness."
1,12,191,00:18:07:20,00:18:08:21,But rumor has it
1,12,192,00:18:09:13,00:18:11:16,"that some assassins
attacked him last night."
1,12,193,00:18:12:24,00:18:15:20,"My uncle and Master Heo
rushed over to his funeral."
1,12,194,00:18:16:10,00:18:19:04,"What if more assassins
like Naksu have appeared?"
1,12,195,00:18:31:04,00:18:33:18,THE LATE KANG MAN-CHEON
1,12,196,00:18:35:17,00:18:38:00,Why can we not offer our condolences?
1,12,197,00:18:39:20,00:18:42:19,"Transporting precious goods
is our family business."
1,12,198,00:18:42:21,00:18:45:11,"But if people find out
that the man of the house"
1,12,199,00:18:45:13,00:18:49:06,"was killed by some assassins,
we could become jobless."
1,12,200,00:18:49:24,00:18:51:13,"We told everyone
he died of a contagious disease."
1,12,201,00:18:52:03,00:18:53:11,That is why no one can enter.
1,12,202,00:18:56:19,00:18:58:10,We understand.
1,12,203,00:18:58:12,00:19:01:07,"Have you found any evidence
that could help us find the assassins?"
1,12,204,00:19:03:06,00:19:04:23,Has an autopsy been carried out?
1,12,205,00:19:06:16,00:19:10:01,"Master Kang was stabbed to death
in front of our eyes."
1,12,206,00:19:10:16,00:19:11:24,An autopsy is unnecessary.
1,12,207,00:19:13:15,00:19:15:10,We will cremate his body tonight.
1,12,208,00:19:15:12,00:19:17:00,That soon?
1,12,209,00:19:17:15,00:19:18:18,It is unfortunate.
1,12,210,00:19:18:20,00:19:20:16,"But we must hurry
before the rumor spreads."
1,12,211,00:19:20:18,00:19:24:16,"I am certain Master Kang would have
also wanted this for his family."
1,12,212,00:19:24:18,00:19:25:19,That is unacceptable.
1,12,213,00:19:25:21,00:19:28:00,"If you cremate his body,"
1,12,214,00:19:28:16,00:19:31:06,"there will be no evidence
that will link to the assassins."
1,12,215,00:19:33:16,00:19:35:03,This is a family matter.
1,12,216,00:19:36:11,00:19:38:07,I understand that you are worried.
1,12,217,00:19:39:07,00:19:42:07,"But the leader of Songrim
does not need to concern himself with it."
1,12,218,00:19:43:14,00:19:46:00,An autopsy is needed.
1,12,219,00:19:46:02,00:19:47:20,Postpone the cremation.
1,12,220,00:19:49:04,00:19:53:00,"Has Songrim gone as far as to meddle
in other families' funerals?"
1,12,221,00:19:56:10,00:19:57:18,We are not meddling.
1,12,222,00:19:58:12,00:20:02:18,"I am simply trying to prevent
the new man of the house"
1,12,223,00:20:02:20,00:20:04:18,from making an irreversible mistake.
1,12,224,00:20:04:20,00:20:06:21,Why is Songrim's leader against this?
1,12,225,00:20:06:23,00:20:08:12,What gives you the right?
1,12,226,00:20:08:14,00:20:12:03,"Only recently did Naksu attack
the mages in the capital."
1,12,227,00:20:12:05,00:20:14:07,"Now, new assassins have emerged."
1,12,228,00:20:15:01,00:20:17:18,"There could be a link between this case
and Naksu who used sorcery."
1,12,229,00:20:18:10,00:20:19:15,That is why I am interfering.
1,12,230,00:20:20:21,00:20:22:17,There was no sorcery involved.
1,12,231,00:20:22:19,00:20:23:17,I witnessed it all.
1,12,232,00:20:23:19,00:20:25:16,How can you be so sure without an autopsy?
1,12,233,00:20:27:01,00:20:30:11,"The new man of the house
does not want an autopsy."
1,12,234,00:20:30:14,00:20:32:19,Jin Mu! You have no say in this.
1,12,235,00:20:33:08,00:20:35:09,"We have the right to interfere
if there are suspicions"
1,12,236,00:20:35:12,00:20:37:01,of sorcery being involved.
1,12,237,00:20:37:03,00:20:39:15,"Do you not agree, Lady Jin?"
1,12,238,00:20:41:14,00:20:42:23,I believe
1,12,239,00:20:44:13,00:20:47:03,the Assistant Gwanju is right this time.
1,12,240,00:20:50:23,00:20:53:12,"The family's heir witnessed
Master Kang's death."
1,12,241,00:20:53:14,00:20:57:03,"And he has no choice but to hide it
due to their family business."
1,12,242,00:20:59:00,00:21:01:24,"No evidence hinted
at sorcery being involved."
1,12,243,00:21:03:07,00:21:07:03,"So I do not think Songrim
should cause a commotion here."
1,12,244,00:21:13:24,00:21:16:04,I just want to protect his honor.
1,12,245,00:21:16:06,00:21:19:18,"Please let us proceed
with this funeral discreetly."
1,12,246,00:21:42:17,00:21:45:23,"Jin Mu does not hesitate
to look down on Songrim now."
1,12,247,00:21:48:23,00:21:51:05,Why are they so against the idea?
1,12,248,00:21:52:09,00:21:54:14,"-It is suspicious.
-By the way,"
1,12,249,00:21:54:16,00:21:58:19,"I had no idea
Lady Jin would take Jin Mu's side."
1,12,250,00:21:59:08,00:22:01:17,She used to hate her half-brother.
1,12,251,00:22:05:22,00:22:09:02,I was truly pleased when you took my side.
1,12,252,00:22:10:24,00:22:12:00,Look.
1,12,253,00:22:12:03,00:22:16:08,"Songrim had no choice but to back down
once we joined hands."
1,12,254,00:22:18:02,00:22:20:01,How close are you to finding Bu-yeon?
1,12,255,00:22:22:13,00:22:24:24,"We searched all the areas
around Lake Gyeongcheondaeho"
1,12,256,00:22:25:01,00:22:28:02,"for blind girls
who were around Bu-yeon's age."
1,12,257,00:22:29:17,00:22:33:06,I have been doing that for ten years now.
1,12,258,00:22:33:08,00:22:34:09,"To be honest,"
1,12,259,00:22:35:04,00:22:37:20,"I believe I found
the whereabouts of Bu-yeon."
1,12,260,00:22:39:06,00:22:42:13,"A young girl had washed up
near the lake ten years ago."
1,12,261,00:22:44:04,00:22:46:03,"-Is that so?
-However…"
1,12,262,00:22:48:01,00:22:49:19,she was long dead.
1,12,263,00:22:56:17,00:23:00:13,"Mother, I doubt that was her."
1,12,264,00:23:00:15,00:23:03:06,I told my men to dig up her grave.
1,12,265,00:23:04:02,00:23:06:11,"If Bu-yeon truly is dead,"
1,12,266,00:23:06:13,00:23:10:03,"I will bring her body
back to you at all costs."
1,12,267,00:23:10:24,00:23:12:13,That is unacceptable.
1,12,268,00:23:13:09,00:23:16:01,Bring my daughter back alive.
1,12,269,00:23:17:05,00:23:19:09,"I will, so please calm down."
1,12,270,00:23:20:14,00:23:22:13,We will find her alive.
1,12,271,00:23:38:10,00:23:40:00,Did you take a good look?
1,12,272,00:23:40:22,00:23:43:05,"They will be your mother
and younger sister."
1,12,273,00:23:43:23,00:23:45:01,Do you think
1,12,274,00:23:45:23,00:23:48:04,they will think that I am their daughter?
1,12,275,00:23:48:06,00:23:49:14,You are dressed
1,12,276,00:23:50:23,00:23:53:20,like Bu-yeon when she was young.
1,12,277,00:23:53:22,00:23:55:22,But I am not sure if Ho-gyeong will agree.
1,12,278,00:23:58:08,00:24:00:15,Then being well-dressed
1,12,279,00:24:02:09,00:24:04:05,will not benefit us.
1,12,280,00:24:04:20,00:24:07:08,I must look shabbier and more pathetic.
1,12,281,00:24:08:16,00:24:10:17,She is a mother who has lost her daughter.
1,12,282,00:24:10:19,00:24:14:20,"I can only win her heart
by pulling at her heartstrings."
1,12,283,00:24:17:16,00:24:18:19,Yes.
1,12,284,00:24:19:18,00:24:21:11,"You are right, So-i."
1,12,285,00:24:25:17,00:24:26:24,I will see to it…
1,12,286,00:24:29:16,00:24:32:13,"that I become a daughter
of the Jin family."
1,12,287,00:24:45:17,00:24:47:08,You look much better now.
1,12,288,00:24:47:24,00:24:50:05,I tend to recover quickly.
1,12,289,00:25:01:15,00:25:03:19,This Hyeongong technique…
1,12,290,00:25:04:18,00:25:06:03,is quite elaborate.
1,12,291,00:25:12:03,00:25:15:23,"I have my suspicions
regarding Master Kang's death."
1,12,292,00:25:28:07,00:25:32:01,"Master Kang was powerful
with a great mastery of spells."
1,12,293,00:25:32:03,00:25:34:20,"But he was already suffering
from a fatal illness."
1,12,294,00:25:35:15,00:25:38:24,"There was no need for anyone
to send the assassins."
1,12,295,00:25:39:01,00:25:41:05,Maybe someone had a grudge against him
1,12,296,00:25:41:24,00:25:44:01,and wanted to kill him themselves.
1,12,297,00:25:44:04,00:25:45:02,No.
1,12,298,00:25:45:04,00:25:46:24,There must be a reason
1,12,299,00:25:48:05,00:25:50:20,"why those assassins came,
although we do not know yet."
1,12,300,00:25:53:20,00:25:57:02,"Once the soul is shifted,
the former body becomes useless."
1,12,301,00:25:57:17,00:25:59:18,But we cannot get rid of it that easily.
1,12,302,00:25:59:20,00:26:03:06,"In other people's eyes,
that body belongs to a powerful mage,"
1,12,303,00:26:03:08,00:26:05:05,"an administrative officer, or a merchant."
1,12,304,00:26:05:22,00:26:08:13,"They will only suspect something
if that individual disappears."
1,12,305,00:26:10:07,00:26:15:00,Naksu was the one who took care of them.
1,12,306,00:26:15:02,00:26:17:03,Do you mean the Shadow Assassin?
1,12,307,00:26:19:12,00:26:22:02,"Thanks to that crazy assassin,"
1,12,308,00:26:22:16,00:26:26:24,"Songrim never suspected
that I was making soul shifters."
1,12,309,00:26:28:07,00:26:30:14,"Back when I was after Naksu,"
1,12,310,00:26:30:16,00:26:34:04,"I thought she was just a lunatic
who wanted to show off her skills."
1,12,311,00:26:34:06,00:26:38:05,"That is why I never suspected
the individuals that she killed."
1,12,312,00:26:40:21,00:26:42:19,Are you saying that she killed those
1,12,313,00:26:43:12,00:26:45:20,whose souls have been shifted by Jin Mu?
1,12,314,00:26:45:22,00:26:47:07,"To be exact,"
1,12,315,00:26:48:09,00:26:51:11,"they must have been those
who were discarded afterward."
1,12,316,00:26:51:14,00:26:54:04,"Did you not say
that Naksu was Cho Chung's daughter?"
1,12,317,00:26:54:24,00:26:59:19,"Are you saying he took that little girl
and turned her into an assassin?"
1,12,318,00:27:01:14,00:27:03:24,That is why I never revealed myself to her
1,12,319,00:27:04:18,00:27:06:23,"and made her live
in the mountains by herself."
1,12,320,00:27:08:11,00:27:10:17,"I took care of her
just enough for her to survive."
1,12,321,00:27:11:13,00:27:15:11,"But she was determined
and grew to be remarkably strong."
1,12,322,00:27:17:00,00:27:18:13,Because…
1,12,323,00:27:19:03,00:27:21:24,"She thought by doing so
she would be avenging her parents."
1,12,324,00:27:22:01,00:27:23:13,That is why she obeyed Jin Mu.
1,12,325,00:27:25:11,00:27:27:23,She was very useful.
1,12,326,00:27:28:13,00:27:31:11,Then a soul shifter ran wild before dying.
1,12,327,00:27:32:02,00:27:33:09,"Thanks to him,"
1,12,328,00:27:34:11,00:27:36:17,Songrim got wind of the alchemy of souls.
1,12,329,00:27:37:18,00:27:39:22,"Once Jin Mu heard that we were after her,"
1,12,330,00:27:40:18,00:27:43:11,he was probably afraid of getting caught.
1,12,331,00:27:44:06,00:27:49:04,"He probably sent Naksu to Songrim
despite knowing that she would die."
1,12,332,00:28:02:11,00:28:04:19,"Mu-deok, go and get some water."
1,12,333,00:28:04:21,00:28:05:22,"Yes, ma'am."
1,12,334,00:28:14:11,00:28:17:17,"Mu-deok, will you seriously
not listen to me?"
1,12,335,00:28:17:19,00:28:19:20,I told you to just get some rest.
1,12,336,00:28:22:20,00:28:24:10,Then what about you?
1,12,337,00:28:24:12,00:28:26:11,Did I not tell you to treat your wounds?
1,12,338,00:28:26:13,00:28:29:18,"I stopped by Sejukwon.
At least I listened to you."
1,12,339,00:28:33:11,00:28:34:16,Check for yourself.
1,12,340,00:28:37:24,00:28:39:04,I smell mugwort.
1,12,341,00:28:46:08,00:28:47:16,What is wrong with you?
1,12,342,00:28:47:19,00:28:51:02,"You know I am struggling these days.
I am just exhausted."
1,12,343,00:28:58:07,00:28:59:16,How warm.
1,12,344,00:29:02:08,00:29:04:11,Did you get a hot mugwort massage?
1,12,345,00:29:05:06,00:29:07:09,"Yes. I am warm, right?"
1,12,346,00:29:08:20,00:29:11:09,Yes. You are.
1,12,347,00:29:15:16,00:29:19:11,"She was used for all the wrong reasons
and met a terrible death."
1,12,348,00:29:20:12,00:29:21:12,Naksu…
1,12,349,00:29:21:14,00:29:24:10,I truly pity her.
1,12,350,00:29:33:21,00:29:35:11,You are cool now. Let me go.
1,12,351,00:29:38:08,00:29:41:09,"-Did you change your shoes?
-Yes."
1,12,352,00:29:41:12,00:29:43:03,"Did you have the food
Maidservant Kim brought?"
1,12,353,00:29:43:05,00:29:46:13,"Yes. I had already had some
before you even mentioned them."
1,12,354,00:29:47:02,00:29:49:01,Well done. Mu-deok.
1,12,355,00:29:51:03,00:29:53:18,I did not know how fascinating this was.
1,12,356,00:29:56:12,00:29:57:14,The yin-and-yang jade?
1,12,357,00:29:57:16,00:29:59:16,"I only found out because you had given it
to the Crown Prince."
1,12,358,00:30:00:10,00:30:02:00,How is it fascinating?
1,12,359,00:30:02:02,00:30:04:01,"-Show me.
-I cannot."
1,12,360,00:30:04:03,00:30:05:17,I will show you
1,12,361,00:30:05:20,00:30:07:23,once I get yours back.
1,12,362,00:30:09:10,00:30:10:18,You will give it to me again
1,12,363,00:30:11:18,00:30:13:03,after you get it back?
1,12,364,00:30:14:22,00:30:17:07,Why? Will you not accept it?
1,12,365,00:30:20:24,00:30:24:16,"I will retrieve it
and place it in your hand."
1,12,366,00:30:24:18,00:30:27:13,This thing has unbelievable powers.
1,12,367,00:30:27:15,00:30:28:23,It is a relief we did not know.
1,12,368,00:30:29:00,00:30:31:14,You are in for a shock once I get it back.
1,12,369,00:30:35:16,00:30:37:20,What kind of powers? Show me.
1,12,370,00:30:38:12,00:30:41:09,"The Crown Prince
foamed in the mouth and fainted."
1,12,371,00:30:41:24,00:30:43:09,It was terrifying.
1,12,372,00:30:43:11,00:30:45:24,That makes sense. It was from Jinyowon.
1,12,373,00:30:46:01,00:30:48:01,It could be a lethal weapon.
1,12,374,00:31:10:18,00:31:12:08,"Hello, Assistant Gwanju."
1,12,375,00:31:17:18,00:31:19:08,The leader of Songrim returned
1,12,376,00:31:19:10,00:31:22:13,to watch the cremation for himself.
1,12,377,00:31:23:05,00:31:25:08,What will you do this time around?
1,12,378,00:31:25:10,00:31:28:04,I am only here to observe.
1,12,379,00:31:29:03,00:31:32:02,"This is the last time
I will ever see Master Kang."
1,12,380,00:31:32:04,00:31:34:15,It is my duty to see him off.
1,12,381,00:32:07:10,00:32:10:11,"You have seen a soul shifter before,"
1,12,382,00:32:10:13,00:32:12:11,so you will recognize the blue mark.
1,12,383,00:32:13:09,00:32:16:19,"Check and see if Master Kang's body
had been used for soul shifting."
1,12,384,00:32:16:21,00:32:19:02,"Even if we find out
that he has shifted souls,"
1,12,385,00:32:19:04,00:32:21:08,"we will not know
whose body he has shifted into."
1,12,386,00:32:22:18,00:32:26:17,"There is something you must do
to help us find that out."
1,12,387,00:32:58:07,00:33:01:18,"I know that you have
already mastered Chisu."
1,12,388,00:33:02:21,00:33:04:21,I did not hide it on purpose.
1,12,389,00:33:04:23,00:33:06:09,I am not scolding you.
1,12,390,00:33:07:06,00:33:08:24,What I am about to ask you to do
1,12,391,00:33:09:01,00:33:11:15,"is quite dangerous
and might suck away your energy."
1,12,392,00:33:12:10,00:33:14:18,"Only those
who have mastered Chisu can do it."
1,12,393,00:33:15:20,00:33:18:23,"A soul shifter runs wild
once their energy is lost."
1,12,394,00:33:19:17,00:33:22:03,The body is still warm.
1,12,395,00:33:22:21,00:33:25:04,Pour your energy into him.
1,12,396,00:33:25:18,00:33:28:08,and make him run wild.
1,12,397,00:33:55:13,00:33:57:05,My lord…
1,12,398,00:34:00:19,00:34:02:02,What is it?
1,12,399,00:34:02:05,00:34:04:20,He is…
1,12,400,00:34:19:03,00:34:21:18,"I will collect his bones, so step aside."
1,12,401,00:34:24:20,00:34:27:18,This is a soul shifter
1,12,402,00:34:27:20,00:34:30:24,who has been petrified after running wild.
1,12,403,00:34:33:16,00:34:37:00,"Now that we have solid evidence
of sorcery being involved,"
1,12,404,00:34:38:10,00:34:40:16,can Songrim take over?
1,12,405,00:34:48:03,00:34:52:13,"Seeing how you are not disturbed
and even tried to hide it,"
1,12,406,00:34:53:03,00:34:55:14,you must have already known about this.
1,12,407,00:34:57:23,00:34:58:24,You already knew
1,12,408,00:34:59:15,00:35:04:12,"that this was a soul shifter
who had run wild."
1,12,409,00:35:28:06,00:35:30:01,"Judging by your skills,"
1,12,410,00:35:30:03,00:35:33:06,"I believe Master Kang's soul
is within that body."
1,12,411,00:35:34:23,00:35:36:20,Then that body's original soul
1,12,412,00:35:36:22,00:35:38:24,must be dead alongside your body.
1,12,413,00:35:39:01,00:35:40:19,Cut that nonsense!
1,12,414,00:36:00:06,00:36:01:11,You are running wild
1,12,415,00:36:02:00,00:36:04:00,after having lost blood and energy.
1,12,416,00:36:07:06,00:36:10:12,"The more you use your skills,
the faster you will become petrified."
1,12,417,00:36:11:03,00:36:12:10,You better stop.
1,12,418,00:36:18:22,00:36:21:02,You should stop here.
1,12,419,00:36:27:08,00:36:29:08,"-Do not kill him!
-Kill him."
1,12,420,00:38:14:21,00:38:17:05,"A soul shifter who is running wild
is dangerous."
1,12,421,00:38:17:17,00:38:19:12,"Thankfully, Cheonbugwan got rid of him."
1,12,422,00:38:20:02,00:38:21:14,"Since you have helped us,"
1,12,423,00:38:21:16,00:38:24:23,we will let Songrim take credit for this.
1,12,424,00:38:29:00,00:38:31:00,"-My lord.
-Yes?"
1,12,425,00:38:41:01,00:38:43:14,"Since you said we could take credit,"
1,12,426,00:38:43:16,00:38:45:17,we will take the body and examine it.
1,12,427,00:38:48:03,00:38:49:14,Be my guest.
1,12,428,00:39:02:23,00:39:04:14,I closed his gate of energy
1,12,429,00:39:04:16,00:39:07:09,to prevent more energy from seeping out.
1,12,430,00:39:08:03,00:39:10:05,We need to revive him and make him talk.
1,12,431,00:39:11:05,00:39:12:14,Will it be possible?
1,12,432,00:39:13:15,00:39:17:12,"He is pretty much a breathing stone.
Yet you want him to speak?"
1,12,433,00:39:17:14,00:39:19:00,This will not be easy.
1,12,434,00:39:27:09,00:39:30:11,"Are you worried
that he may still be alive?"
1,12,435,00:39:32:21,00:39:34:16,"Even so, they will not succeed."
1,12,436,00:39:35:14,00:39:38:04,"Perhaps it is possible
with the help of the ice stone."
1,12,437,00:39:38:16,00:39:40:06,But that is their only bet.
1,12,438,00:39:40:23,00:39:44:01,"Are you saying he can be revived
with the ice stone?"
1,12,439,00:39:44:03,00:39:45:03,That is correct.
1,12,440,00:39:46:03,00:39:48:17,And you are in possession of that stone?
1,12,441,00:39:49:20,00:39:51:06,You do not need to know that.
1,12,442,00:39:52:16,00:39:54:12,Get the assassins ready.
1,12,443,00:39:55:05,00:39:56:19,I will find a way
1,12,444,00:39:56:21,00:39:59:10,"even if it means shifting the soul
of a Jeongjingak mage."
1,12,445,00:40:06:12,00:40:08:17,"-Hey, Beom.
-What?"
1,12,446,00:40:08:19,00:40:09:18,Let us go.
1,12,447,00:40:18:03,00:40:19:09,THE ART OF HYEONGONG
1,12,448,00:40:19:11,00:40:21:00,PRESSING THE HEAD OF A LEOPARD STANCE
1,12,449,00:40:21:03,00:40:22:23,"DIRECT SENDING STANCE, CAULDRON STANCE"
1,12,450,00:41:56:07,00:41:57:11,Yul.
1,12,451,00:41:59:05,00:42:00:15,Uk.
1,12,452,00:42:01:15,00:42:02:24,Are you going to train?
1,12,453,00:42:04:03,00:42:05:02,Yes.
1,12,454,00:42:05:22,00:42:06:20,And you?
1,12,455,00:42:12:21,00:42:14:05,I just slashed…
1,12,456,00:42:16:03,00:42:17:12,a soul shifter.
1,12,457,00:42:21:10,00:42:24:13,"Master Kang who had passed away yesterday
was a soul shifter."
1,12,458,00:42:26:01,00:42:27:09,Really?
1,12,459,00:42:27:11,00:42:29:07,But how did you know that?
1,12,460,00:42:30:15,00:42:32:07,"If they hide their blue mark,"
1,12,461,00:42:32:09,00:42:34:13,"they can easily blend in
with other people."
1,12,462,00:42:35:11,00:42:37:05,"But once they run wild,"
1,12,463,00:42:38:10,00:42:39:23,there is no turning back.
1,12,464,00:42:46:18,00:42:49:14,"They will start to petrify
as their energy seeps out."
1,12,465,00:42:50:11,00:42:53:12,"They can prevent that
by feeding on others' energy."
1,12,466,00:42:54:24,00:42:56:12,"But once they do that,"
1,12,467,00:42:58:15,00:43:00:14,"they will no longer be humans,
but monsters."
1,12,468,00:43:03:19,00:43:04:23,Monsters?
1,12,469,00:43:20:00,00:43:22:09,And it is our duty to protect this world…
1,12,470,00:43:26:13,00:43:28:02,from such monsters.
1,12,471,00:43:36:19,00:43:39:09,"We can also protect
the monsters from this world."
1,12,472,00:43:41:07,00:43:42:22,"Once we keep them in check,"
1,12,473,00:43:43:18,00:43:45:15,the world will be at peace.
1,12,474,00:43:46:20,00:43:49:12,"Everyone had high hopes for you
ever since you were little,"
1,12,475,00:43:49:14,00:43:52:13,"so you think
you need to do something grand."
1,12,476,00:43:52:15,00:43:53:24,But I was told
1,12,477,00:43:55:05,00:43:57:06,to sit still all my life.
1,12,478,00:43:59:18,00:44:00:23,I will follow
1,12,479,00:44:02:11,00:44:04:06,my heart.
1,12,480,00:44:30:20,00:44:34:03,"Jin Mu let Songrim find out
something critical."
1,12,481,00:44:34:05,00:44:36:23,"What if Songrim suspects
the palace as well?"
1,12,482,00:44:37:16,00:44:38:24,The Royal Palace…
1,12,483,00:44:39:24,00:44:44:10,"is not a place he can just barge into
like he did at Daegangtongun."
1,12,484,00:44:44:12,00:44:47:13,"If he does, I will be in danger."
1,12,485,00:44:48:03,00:44:49:24,"Ever since Gil-ju died,"
1,12,486,00:44:50:01,00:44:51:21,I was not able to feed on energy.
1,12,487,00:44:53:16,00:44:56:06,I am afraid I will run wild.
1,12,488,00:44:59:16,00:45:02:02,Could you share some of the power
1,12,489,00:45:03:00,00:45:04:15,of the ice stone with me?
1,12,490,00:45:05:23,00:45:06:23,What did you say?
1,12,491,00:45:07:00,00:45:10:11,"The only person who can serve you
despite knowing your true face…"
1,12,492,00:45:14:16,00:45:16:08,"is only me, is it not?"
1,12,493,00:45:17:13,00:45:18:18,Shaman.
1,12,494,00:45:20:00,00:45:21:15,You little…
1,12,495,00:45:21:17,00:45:24:05,I told you never to address me like that.
1,12,496,00:45:26:06,00:45:28:12,"Would you like
to be petrified this instant?"
1,12,497,00:45:31:02,00:45:32:07,I know you cannot do that.
1,12,498,00:45:33:24,00:45:36:13,I am the only one in this palace
1,12,499,00:45:36:15,00:45:39:13,"who knows that you are Shaman Choi,"
1,12,500,00:45:39:15,00:45:42:16,despite residing in the Queen's body.
1,12,501,00:45:44:01,00:45:45:13,"If I die,"
1,12,502,00:45:45:15,00:45:49:20,"you will bring your sibling here
from Jinyowon?"
1,12,503,00:45:54:04,00:45:55:09,"Furthermore,"
1,12,504,00:45:56:03,00:46:01:02,the real Queen is residing in your body.
1,12,505,00:46:03:03,00:46:07:09,Should I not visit her from time to time?
1,12,506,00:46:07:24,00:46:09:00,Right?
1,12,507,00:46:13:14,00:46:15:17,It is getting difficult for me
1,12,508,00:46:16:18,00:46:18:16,to live in this body.
1,12,509,00:46:20:16,00:46:22:21,Tell Jin Mu
1,12,510,00:46:22:23,00:46:26:19,"to shift my soul
into someone else's body once again,"
1,12,511,00:46:28:12,00:46:29:18,Your Highness.
1,12,512,00:46:33:04,00:46:34:10,I understand.
1,12,513,00:46:35:12,00:46:36:22,You may leave.
1,12,514,00:47:02:23,00:47:04:05,Why are you here?
1,12,515,00:47:05:04,00:47:07:10,"I will let you beat me.
Then it will all be over."
1,12,516,00:47:12:08,00:47:14:03,I forfeit.
1,12,517,00:47:14:18,00:47:16:00,"Hey, Uk!"
1,12,518,00:47:23:07,00:47:24:20,You wanted to go before me.
1,12,519,00:47:24:23,00:47:26:04,And you won.
1,12,520,00:47:33:04,00:47:35:15,Dang-gu was willing to let you beat him.
1,12,521,00:47:35:17,00:47:37:01,How could you refuse?
1,12,522,00:47:37:03,00:47:39:12,"I did not know
you were this proud of yourself."
1,12,523,00:47:39:15,00:47:42:13,"You gave me this signal
and told me not to fight him."
1,12,524,00:47:42:15,00:47:43:17,When did I?
1,12,525,00:47:43:19,00:47:45:15,I only looked at you out of relief.
1,12,526,00:47:45:17,00:47:47:11,Then you should have signaled me.
1,12,527,00:47:48:02,00:47:49:00,Like this.
1,12,528,00:47:49:02,00:47:50:10,I did.
1,12,529,00:47:51:12,00:47:54:19,"How could I understand that?
Had I known, I would have just done it."
1,12,530,00:47:56:08,00:47:57:23,You only have one chance left.
1,12,531,00:47:58:15,00:47:59:21,What will you do?
1,12,532,00:47:59:24,00:48:01:11,"What, are you blaming me?"
1,12,533,00:48:02:01,00:48:04:16,"Why are you getting mad at me
when you gave that jade to him?"
1,12,534,00:48:04:18,00:48:07:07,"Are you seriously
pointing fingers right now?"
1,12,535,00:48:07:09,00:48:08:21,How childish.
1,12,536,00:48:08:23,00:48:11:10,"Childish? Do you want me
to show you what real childishness is?"
1,12,537,00:48:11:12,00:48:12:11,I quit.
1,12,538,00:48:13:14,00:48:14:14,Should I keep this up?
1,12,539,00:48:24:17,00:48:27:12,"Mages have been guarding
Sejukwon since last night."
1,12,540,00:48:28:14,00:48:31:12,The soul shifter's body must be in there.
1,12,541,00:48:31:14,00:48:34:08,"If it was a body, they would have
kept it in the secret room."
1,12,542,00:48:34:20,00:48:37:13,"Why would they take it to Sejukwon,
which is for the living?"
1,12,543,00:48:46:14,00:48:50:01,"I came by because I was curious
about what happened to the body."
1,12,544,00:48:50:03,00:48:52:09,Please wait. I will inform our leader.
1,12,545,00:49:09:01,00:49:12:12,"I heard the leader was here at Sejukwon,
so I came to see him."
1,12,546,00:49:12:14,00:49:15:02,"No one is allowed
to enter Sejukwon at the moment."
1,12,547,00:49:15:04,00:49:17:11,"Then I will meet
with Young Master Jang first."
1,12,548,00:49:17:13,00:49:19:15,Please tell the leader that I am here.
1,12,549,00:49:21:05,00:49:22:11,Jin Mu is here
1,12,550,00:49:23:20,00:49:26:20,"to check if the soul shifter
has really died or not."
1,12,551,00:49:27:24,00:49:30:08,"Tell him to leave
since we are still investigating."
1,12,552,00:49:30:10,00:49:33:12,"Yes, my lord. However,
someone else is here to see you."
1,12,553,00:49:34:08,00:49:35:11,Tell them to leave.
1,12,554,00:49:35:13,00:49:38:03,No one is allowed anywhere near Sejukwon.
1,12,555,00:49:38:05,00:49:39:04,"Yes, my lord."
1,12,556,00:49:39:06,00:49:41:18,"I will tell Maidservant Kim
to leave as well."
1,12,557,00:49:43:00,00:49:44:03,What?
1,12,558,00:49:45:05,00:49:46:10,Maidservant Kim?
1,12,559,00:49:46:12,00:49:49:09,"I will tell her
that the leader cannot meet anyone."
1,12,560,00:49:52:07,00:49:53:12,Hold on.
1,12,561,00:49:54:19,00:49:58:05,She can be an exception.
1,12,562,00:50:07:21,00:50:10:06,"It has been a long time, Maidservant Kim."
1,12,563,00:50:29:14,00:50:32:24,"I stayed at Gwanju Jang Gang's residence
when I served him,"
1,12,564,00:50:33:16,00:50:36:15,"and you made me
countless delicious dishes."
1,12,565,00:50:37:18,00:50:39:05,You ate so much
1,12,566,00:50:39:17,00:50:43:03,that your rice bowl was exceptionally big.
1,12,567,00:50:44:06,00:50:45:09,Do you remember?
1,12,568,00:50:45:11,00:50:48:15,You had a huge brass bowl.
1,12,569,00:50:48:17,00:50:51:16,"Back in the day, I was always hungry."
1,12,570,00:50:52:14,00:50:56:04,"You must have made
something scrumptious once again."
1,12,571,00:50:56:19,00:50:59:22,"Yes, I have. I made these snacks myself."
1,12,572,00:51:04:01,00:51:07:16,"Honey biscuits.
I used to love them back in the day."
1,12,573,00:51:07:18,00:51:08:23,"Yes, indeed."
1,12,574,00:51:09:00,00:51:12:00,"Every time I gave some to you
to give to the Gwanju,"
1,12,575,00:51:12:02,00:51:15:04,you would stash a few in your pockets.
1,12,576,00:51:16:09,00:51:20:01,"I did that because I was only allowed
to eat once he finished."
1,12,577,00:51:20:21,00:51:24:24,"In any case, I benefited a lot
from the Gwanju while following him."
1,12,578,00:51:25:02,00:51:27:03,"I had a chance to taste
such delicious treats"
1,12,579,00:51:28:02,00:51:30:13,and learn a special spell.
1,12,580,00:51:35:17,00:51:39:03,"Does it not taste sweeter
if you eat it in secret?"
1,12,581,00:51:45:23,00:51:47:03,That is exactly why
1,12,582,00:51:48:02,00:51:50:14,things that taste sweet are dangerous.
1,12,583,00:51:50:16,00:51:54:16,"Once you have a taste of it,
you desire it at all costs."
1,12,584,00:51:58:00,00:51:59:15,You fail to distinguish
1,12,585,00:52:01:03,00:52:02:18,what you can have
1,12,586,00:52:04:11,00:52:06:04,and what you cannot.
1,12,587,00:52:08:06,00:52:11:00,"You are hurting my feelings
by not letting me have any."
1,12,588,00:52:13:00,00:52:16:13,"Goodness, do not be so stingy with food."
1,12,589,00:52:20:19,00:52:24:01,The Gwanju loved this snack.
1,12,590,00:52:24:03,00:52:26:00,How about his son?
1,12,591,00:52:26:02,00:52:29:03,"Young Master Uk loves
honey biscuits as well."
1,12,592,00:52:29:05,00:52:31:17,Then shall we share this with him?
1,12,593,00:52:32:21,00:52:37:03,"I have many stories
to tell him about his father."
1,12,594,00:52:44:18,00:52:48:01,You and Uk have nothing to talk about.
1,12,595,00:52:48:03,00:52:49:20,You may leave.
1,12,596,00:52:49:22,00:52:52:18,"He just wants a biscuit.
Do not be so heartless."
1,12,597,00:52:53:11,00:52:56:15,"You are not letting me share
the good memories with him."
1,12,598,00:52:56:17,00:52:57:16,"But then again,"
1,12,599,00:52:59:11,00:53:01:23,"you must not want me
to touch what is yours."
1,12,600,00:53:04:19,00:53:05:22,Wait.
1,12,601,00:53:06:19,00:53:09:24,"Here. This was actually
for our young master,"
1,12,602,00:53:10:01,00:53:11:15,but you can have it instead.
1,12,603,00:53:12:03,00:53:13:05,Maidservant Kim.
1,12,604,00:53:14:03,00:53:15:08,Do not give that to him.
1,12,605,00:53:16:06,00:53:18:07,"If I truly wanted to have some,"
1,12,606,00:53:18:21,00:53:21:08,I would have easily stolen a few of them.
1,12,607,00:53:21:24,00:53:24:05,But I will let you win.
1,12,608,00:53:26:16,00:53:30:23,"It had been a while since we last met.
I am truly sad to say goodbye."
1,12,609,00:53:39:19,00:53:41:01,Jin Mu used to take revenge
1,12,610,00:53:41:03,00:53:44:00,if he was scolded for eating something.
1,12,611,00:53:44:16,00:53:46:06,They were just honey biscuits.
1,12,612,00:53:46:08,00:53:47:24,You should have let him have them.
1,12,613,00:53:48:01,00:53:50:03,I just did not want him to eat
1,12,614,00:53:51:12,00:53:55:07,what you worked so hard to make.
1,12,615,00:53:57:03,00:53:58:07,Sit down.
1,12,616,00:53:58:09,00:54:00:12,We have not seen each other in a while.
1,12,617,00:54:00:14,00:54:03:24,Let us chat over some tea.
1,12,618,00:54:07:15,00:54:09:08,Is something wrong?
1,12,619,00:54:10:04,00:54:11:17,You seem quite testy.
1,12,620,00:54:15:17,00:54:17:00,Do not worry.
1,12,621,00:54:18:04,00:54:22:11,"Once I have your honey biscuits,
I will feel better."
1,12,622,00:54:32:10,00:54:33:18,Mu-deok.
1,12,623,00:54:34:22,00:54:36:12,I need you to run an errand.
1,12,624,00:54:36:15,00:54:38:14,An errand? What is it?
1,12,625,00:54:38:16,00:54:39:21,Go to Cheonbugwan.
1,12,626,00:54:41:01,00:54:44:08,"This just does not feel right,
so I need to send this over."
1,12,627,00:54:45:17,00:54:46:23,Sure.
1,12,628,00:54:51:17,00:54:53:15,Is something going on at Sejukwon?
1,12,629,00:54:54:17,00:54:57:05,I do not know the details.
1,12,630,00:54:57:07,00:55:00:20,"But I think it is related
to last night's incident at Daegangtongun."
1,12,631,00:55:01:14,00:55:03:18,"I heard Cheonbugwan
and Songrim had a fight."
1,12,632,00:55:09:05,00:55:10:02,Where is Yul?
1,12,633,00:55:10:04,00:55:11:22,I have not seen him since last night.
1,12,634,00:55:11:24,00:55:13:22,He must be doing something for the leader.
1,12,635,00:55:15:03,00:55:16:06,Really?
1,12,636,00:55:17:21,00:55:19:03,I just slashed…
1,12,637,00:55:21:06,00:55:22:17,a soul shifter.
1,12,638,00:55:35:07,00:55:37:11,We must strengthen Songrim's boundaries.
1,12,639,00:55:37:13,00:55:40:09,"You are forbidden
from leaving Songrim for the time being."
1,12,640,00:55:42:07,00:55:44:01,Those who have mastered Ryusu and more
1,12,641,00:55:44:03,00:55:47:13,"shall go to Sejukwon
and follow Sang-ho's orders."
1,12,642,00:55:47:15,00:55:48:18,"-Yes, my lord.
-Yes, my lord."
1,12,643,00:55:49:15,00:55:50:13,Jang Uk.
1,12,644,00:55:51:22,00:55:52:22,You will stay here.
1,12,645,00:55:54:07,00:55:56:00,Everyone except for Uk
1,12,646,00:55:56:02,00:55:58:22,will follow Sang-ho and go to Sejukwon.
1,12,647,00:55:58:24,00:56:00:06,"-Yes, my lord.
-Yes, my lord."
1,12,648,00:56:05:20,00:56:06:24,My lord.
1,12,649,00:56:07:21,00:56:09:19,Why am I not going?
1,12,650,00:56:09:21,00:56:12:16,"You are exempt
since we do not need you there."
1,12,651,00:56:13:22,00:56:15:19,Is there something dangerous there?
1,12,652,00:56:16:20,00:56:18:05,Is it a soul shifter?
1,12,653,00:56:18:19,00:56:20:22,It is none of your concern.
1,12,654,00:56:21:15,00:56:23:01,Do not be curious about it.
1,12,655,00:56:23:03,00:56:25:22,"Why are you keeping me in the dark
when I am also a mage here?"
1,12,656,00:56:26:00,00:56:29:08,You are excluded from everything.
1,12,657,00:56:29:23,00:56:32:17,"If you are bored of being alone,
you may leave Songrim."
1,12,658,00:56:32:20,00:56:36:04,"Go back to your home
and do whatever makes you comfortable."
1,12,659,00:56:38:21,00:56:42:09,"Yes, my lord.
Thank you for worrying about my comfort."
1,12,660,00:57:00:11,00:57:01:15,Mu-deok.
1,12,661,00:57:02:19,00:57:05:00,"Let us go to Chwiseonru
and have something tasty."
1,12,662,00:57:06:15,00:57:10:02,"All the mages were headed to Sejukwon.
Why are you not there?"
1,12,663,00:57:11:16,00:57:13:03,I was told to stay out of it
1,12,664,00:57:13:05,00:57:16:05,"and that I did not need
to concern myself with the matter."
1,12,665,00:57:16:20,00:57:19:10,"-Let us go.
-Maidservant Kim gave me an errand to do."
1,12,666,00:57:20:03,00:57:22:15,Sure. Let us go together. Where to?
1,12,667,00:57:23:11,00:57:24:14,Cheonbugwan.
1,12,668,00:57:26:07,00:57:27:05,Let us go.
1,12,669,00:57:31:24,00:57:36:16,"I heard that you told her
to shift you into another body."
1,12,670,00:57:38:19,00:57:40:02,Will you do that?
1,12,671,00:57:40:22,00:57:45:04,"Then let me shift souls with that girl
who will enter Jinyowon as Jin Bu-yeon."
1,12,672,00:57:47:13,00:57:49:06,"I have been a eunuch for a while,"
1,12,673,00:57:50:00,00:57:51:17,so I do not mind a woman's body.
1,12,674,00:57:52:12,00:57:57:10,"I would like to shift my soul
into a powerful body like the Shaman has."
1,12,675,00:57:59:02,00:58:00:08,"""Shaman."""
1,12,676,00:58:01:15,00:58:03:23,She was offended by how you reminded her
1,12,677,00:58:04:00,00:58:07:03,"that she was a shaman dealing
with trifling affairs like divinations."
1,12,678,00:58:07:19,00:58:09:08,I was only stating a fact.
1,12,679,00:58:11:20,00:58:16:12,"I was also reminded today of how I used
to beg for food and steal snacks."
1,12,680,00:58:18:04,00:58:22:05,"They were indeed facts,
but I was still unhappy to hear them."
1,12,681,00:58:32:01,00:58:35:05,"Jin Mu wanted a honey biscuit
while visiting Songrim,"
1,12,682,00:58:35:07,00:58:37:02,but Park Jin did not let him have any.
1,12,683,00:58:37:18,00:58:39:18,"Maidservant Kim was worried
he would hold a grudge,"
1,12,684,00:58:39:20,00:58:41:19,so she wanted me to deliver this.
1,12,685,00:58:41:21,00:58:44:20,"Are you saying they were childish enough
to fight over some food?"
1,12,686,00:58:44:22,00:58:47:16,"Our leader has a cheap way
of tormenting others."
1,12,687,00:58:47:18,00:58:50:14,Why was he so picky about a honey biscuit?
1,12,688,00:58:50:16,00:58:52:23,You are right. He was cheap.
1,12,689,00:59:00:01,00:59:01:15,"Here, at Cheonbugwan,"
1,12,690,00:59:01:17,00:59:04:12,we have records of all the constellations.
1,12,691,00:59:27:18,00:59:31:04,"I will tell the Assistant Gwanju
that this was from the Jang family."
1,12,692,00:59:31:24,00:59:35:15,"Please tell him that
it was from Maidservant Kim."
1,12,693,00:59:36:22,00:59:39:05,"Tell him that we use a lot of oil
in our honey biscuits"
1,12,694,00:59:39:08,00:59:41:15,"and that he should have them
with green tea."
1,12,695,00:59:41:17,00:59:42:19,"Yes, Young Master Jang."
1,12,696,00:59:42:21,00:59:45:12,"We also use a lot of honey
for our honey biscuits."
1,12,697,00:59:45:14,00:59:47:22,"He should store them in a cool place
or they will become sticky."
1,12,698,00:59:47:23,00:59:50:09,"-Yes, Young Master Jang.
-Since we have brought that,"
1,12,699,00:59:50:11,00:59:52:10,"-can I take a look inside?
-Yes--"
1,12,700,00:59:52:12,00:59:54:22,"-Sorry?
-Thank you. It will not take long."
1,12,701,00:59:55:00,00:59:55:23,Let us go.
1,12,702,00:59:57:14,00:59:58:13,But…
1,12,703,01:00:06:09,01:00:08:07,I have always wanted to visit.
1,12,704,01:00:08:09,01:00:11:21,"Despite my father being the Gwanju,
I never got to visit."
1,12,705,01:00:16:09,01:00:18:16,"Gosh, what is that?"
1,12,706,01:00:20:11,01:00:23:01,"You have been here, right?"
1,12,707,01:00:23:02,01:00:25:06,"Your father was
a constellation recorder mage."
1,12,708,01:00:26:10,01:00:28:08,Did you come here for me?
1,12,709,01:00:30:24,01:00:34:01,"You could have asked
someone else to run the errand."
1,12,710,01:00:34:17,01:00:37:19,"Was it not
because you wanted to come here?"
1,12,711,01:00:42:10,01:00:45:12,"My father brought me here often
when I was little."
1,12,712,01:00:46:15,01:00:50:00,"He even showed me the plate
that was recorded the day I was born."
1,12,713,01:00:51:12,01:00:53:02,He was a considerate father.
1,12,714,01:00:56:15,01:00:58:03,"Come to think of it,"
1,12,715,01:00:58:05,01:01:01:07,"I believe he recorded the constellation
on the day you were born."
1,12,716,01:01:03:17,01:01:05:05,Is that so?
1,12,717,01:01:06:13,01:01:10:00,"The constellation of the day I was born
must be somewhere here."
1,12,718,01:01:23:09,01:01:25:23,You had promised to shift my soul.
1,12,719,01:01:26:11,01:01:29:02,"But rather, you are making me run wild."
1,12,720,01:01:29:19,01:01:31:04,You are no longer needed.
1,12,721,01:01:31:21,01:01:34:06,You will turn into a stone now.
1,12,722,01:01:49:24,01:01:51:07,You have gone insane.
1,12,723,01:02:10:05,01:02:12:11,"Once night draws in, the mages will come."
1,12,724,01:02:13:02,01:02:14:16,"Let us watch them
record the constellations."
1,12,725,01:02:14:18,01:02:16:20,I heard it is a magnificent view.
1,12,726,01:02:19:00,01:02:22:18,"I would love that, but it will be
troublesome if we get caught."
1,12,727,01:02:22:20,01:02:23:23,Let us just go home.
1,12,728,01:02:37:14,01:02:39:06,Eunuch Kim has run wild.
1,12,729,01:02:39:08,01:02:41:17,"No one must find out
that he is a soul shifter."
1,12,730,01:02:42:07,01:02:45:18,"He is still in Cheonbugwan.
We must find him before morning comes."
1,12,731,01:02:45:20,01:02:46:24,"Yes, my lord."
1,12,732,01:03:30:09,01:03:31:21,I know you are here.
1,12,733,01:03:32:09,01:03:34:17,"Do not cause any more problems
and just come out."
1,12,734,01:03:34:19,01:03:36:07,I will give you what you want.
1,12,735,01:03:44:10,01:03:45:16,Come on out.
1,12,736,01:03:47:23,01:03:49:21,"-Come on out!
-I will."
1,12,737,01:03:54:22,01:03:56:21,"-Jang Uk.
-Yes."
1,12,738,01:04:02:10,01:04:04:01,Why are you here?
1,12,739,01:04:04:13,01:04:06:05,I am sorry. I was running an errand
1,12,740,01:04:06:07,01:04:07:21,and decided to take a look around.
1,12,741,01:04:12:03,01:04:13:07,An errand?
1,12,742,01:04:13:23,01:04:17:13,"I heard you really wanted
our honey biscuits."
1,12,743,01:04:18:17,01:04:20:01,Honey biscuits?
1,12,744,01:04:20:03,01:04:22:04,"She saw you were sad that
you did not have any honey biscuits,"
1,12,745,01:04:22:06,01:04:24:00,"so Maidservant Kim told me
to send you some."
1,12,746,01:04:26:16,01:04:29:01,Thank you. Tell her I said thank you.
1,12,747,01:04:29:20,01:04:30:23,What?
1,12,748,01:04:32:09,01:04:35:07,"I thought you would be upset
that I came in here without asking."
1,12,749,01:04:36:00,01:04:36:22,Are you not mad?
1,12,750,01:04:36:24,01:04:40:07,"You only came here to give me
the honey biscuits. You may go."
1,12,751,01:04:41:14,01:04:43:14,What a relief. To be honest…
1,12,752,01:04:45:03,01:04:46:03,I have company.
1,12,753,01:04:47:13,01:04:49:10,"Mu-deok, come out. He is not mad."
1,12,754,01:04:50:13,01:04:52:11,She is my maid.
1,12,755,01:04:54:00,01:04:55:20,"I am Mu-deok,"
1,12,756,01:04:55:22,01:04:57:11,his maid.
1,12,757,01:04:59:24,01:05:01:12,You were here as well.
1,12,758,01:05:02:05,01:05:04:05,I thought you would be furious.
1,12,759,01:05:04:07,01:05:07:11,I am truly grateful for your hospitality.
1,12,760,01:05:07:13,01:05:08:20,Please enjoy the snacks.
1,12,761,01:05:08:22,01:05:11:05,Let us know if you want more.
1,12,762,01:05:13:24,01:05:15:06,Thank you.
1,12,763,01:05:15:08,01:05:16:11,Let us go.
1,12,764,01:05:31:15,01:05:34:21,He is a royal eunuch.
1,12,765,01:05:35:22,01:05:37:07,What is wrong with him?
1,12,766,01:05:38:13,01:05:39:24,He is a soul shifter.
1,12,767,01:05:40:21,01:05:43:11,Look. He is running wild.
1,12,768,01:05:51:10,01:05:53:20,"I cannot believe a soul shifter
was inside the palace."
1,12,769,01:05:53:22,01:05:54:23,It was probably
1,12,770,01:05:55:20,01:05:57:02,his doing.
1,12,771,01:06:00:11,01:06:01:20,I know you are here.
1,12,772,01:06:02:08,01:06:04:17,"Do not cause
any more problems and just come out."
1,12,773,01:06:04:19,01:06:06:13,I will give you what you want.
1,12,774,01:06:13:08,01:06:14:19,Come on out!
1,12,775,01:06:23:08,01:06:24:15,I will.
1,12,776,01:06:50:12,01:06:51:17,Run.
1,12,777,01:06:54:21,01:06:56:02,There is a door behind us.
1,12,778,01:07:09:02,01:07:10:18,Why will you not let us leave?
1,12,779,01:07:11:18,01:07:15:20,"I do not think it is right to let a mage
who has barged in here leave so easily."
1,12,780,01:07:15:22,01:07:18:01,You will be in a tight spot
1,12,781,01:07:19:01,01:07:20:13,if I disappeared from Cheonbugwan.
1,12,782,01:07:20:15,01:07:22:01,I never said I would harm you.
1,12,783,01:07:23:06,01:07:25:11,Your body will still be around.
1,12,784,01:07:34:24,01:07:35:24,Uk.
1,12,785,01:08:38:15,01:08:40:22,You are within a barrier that I have made.
1,12,786,01:08:45:12,01:08:46:15,Do not worry.
1,12,787,01:08:47:12,01:08:49:15,"You will be unscathed
as long as you sit still."
1,12,788,01:08:51:06,01:08:53:04,Wait there for now.
1,12,789,01:09:06:18,01:09:08:05,"Mu-deok, was it?"
1,12,790,01:09:09:22,01:09:11:21,So you were the maid
1,12,791,01:09:11:23,01:09:16:03,"who always stuck by his side
and caused a nuisance."
1,12,792,01:09:19:10,01:09:21:10,There is a human here.
1,12,793,01:09:21:23,01:09:24:01,Come and replenish your energy.
1,12,794,01:09:35:18,01:09:37:05,"After that,"
1,12,795,01:09:37:19,01:09:41:17,"I will let you shift souls
with a young master as you wished."
1,12,796,01:09:55:17,01:09:57:05,Did that wench Shaman Choi
1,12,797,01:09:58:17,01:10:00:20,tell you to kill me?
1,12,798,01:10:01:21,01:10:03:20,I need your help.
1,12,799,01:10:04:14,01:10:07:11,"If you do not trust me,
I will stay outside."
1,12,800,01:10:09:09,01:10:11:14,Feed on her as you please.
1,12,801,01:11:03:06,01:11:04:20,I need to get out of here.
1,12,802,01:11:59:19,01:12:02:17,"Master, help me once again."
1,12,803,01:12:03:11,01:12:05:20,Give your hesitant pupil confidence.
1,12,804,01:12:17:08,01:12:18:12,Jang Uk.
1,12,805,01:12:58:15,01:12:59:16,Mu-deok.
1,12,806,01:13:02:05,01:13:03:09,Mu-deok!
1,12,807,01:13:36:06,01:13:37:09,Mu-deok.
1,12,808,01:14:05:19,01:14:06:24,Mu-deok.
1,12,809,01:14:10:06,01:14:11:11,I…
1,12,810,01:14:13:18,01:14:15:17,I just fed on his energy.
1,12,811,01:14:22:22,01:14:24:03,Am I…
1,12,812,01:14:25:18,01:14:27:07,running wild?
1,12,813,01:14:41:16,01:14:43:14,"-Mu-deok.
-Do not come near me."
1,12,814,01:14:56:23,01:14:58:12,"No, you are fine."
1,12,815,01:14:59:06,01:15:00:15,You are all right.
1,12,816,01:15:02:09,01:15:04:05,"-You will be fine.
-No."
1,12,817,01:15:05:05,01:15:06:06,Do not touch me.
1,12,818,01:15:08:08,01:15:09:23,"If I am truly running wild,"
1,12,819,01:15:12:04,01:15:14:00,then you must not touch me.
1,12,820,01:15:17:12,01:15:19:05,"Otherwise, your energy will be stolen"
1,12,821,01:15:20:02,01:15:21:05,and you will die.
