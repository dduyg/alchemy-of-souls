1
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:11,106
I heard you have been going fishing
with Uk these days.

2
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:15,405
That is true.
It is so boring to fish alone.

3
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,949
You once said that

4
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:21,456
Uk shares the same fate
as Master Seo Gyeong.

5
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:24,999
Is that why you are encouraging
and guiding him?

6
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:28,422
I am not the one guiding him.

7
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:32,965
Then is there someone else?

8
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,427
Who is it?

9
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,849
Do you know who that person is?

10
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:48,151
No one is teaching Uk
how to do spells right now.

11
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,650
I can be sure of it.

12
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:52,945
It was confirmed by his maid
who is always by his side.

13
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:57,826
Are you saying he progressed
that much single-handedly?

14
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,869
He may have become a mage of Jeongjingak

15
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,333
thanks to his schemes and good luck.

16
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:03,923
But he has no skills.

17
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:06,788
I am sure you have heard
of our ongoing bet.

18
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,499
He has yet to win once.

19
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,264
You are right.

20
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,890
If he had a master, his master would have
prevented him from being humiliated.

21
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:19,103
Reading Words of the Heart
had won him respect.

22
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,180
But our bet has humiliated him.

23
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:24,766
Seeing how he has not given up,

24
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,443
that object

25
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,324
must mean a lot to him.

26
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,445
Are you all right? Can you see?

27
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,410
Yes. And you, Young Master?

28
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,580
Did you get hurt anywhere?

29
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:42,292
You are right.

30
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:47,205
I did not know
how important this was to him.

31
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,054
Once Uk returns,

32
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,965
Beom would want to have
their duel right away.

33
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,430
But he is busy fishing right now?

34
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,513
And Mu-deok is letting him do that?

35
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:01,557
Gosh.

36
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,139
I doubt she would have let him.

37
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:06,734
So you can also see
that Uk listens to Mu-deok.

38
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:10,771
He is stubborn about things
no matter what others tell him.

39
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,817
But he always listens to Mu-deok.

40
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,622
We can also protect
the monsters from this world.

41
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,410
The monster
he was talking about was Naksu.

42
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:29,384
If he is looking for
the ice stone to protect her…

43
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,380
-They must not be together.
-What?

44
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:36,723
Why not?

45
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,469
Do you not like that they are close?

46
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:42,846
I do not.

47
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:46,728
If they end up going down the wrong path,

48
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:51,397
there will be nothing I can do.

49
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:06,445
Uk is someone who can potentially
bring chaos to the world.

50
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,460
What if we support and raise him
into an uncontrollable individual

51
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:14,002
and he becomes the center
of the world's attention?

52
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,417
Are you afraid that he will desire
to become king according to his fate

53
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,587
and bring chaos to Daeho?

54
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:25,345
It may be possible
if he learns of the King's Star.

55
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,892
It will forever broaden his horizons

56
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:32,516
and desire to achieve greatness.

57
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,324
Jin.

58
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:38,897
How long did it take you to reach Chisu?

59
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:40,697
Chisu?

60
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:44,327
It did not take me long to reach Ryusu,

61
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:48,579
but it did take some time to reach Chisu.

62
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:56,708
It took me three years
to look into the sky's energy,

63
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,469
three years to read the land's energy,

64
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:06,314
and four years to feel
the energy around me.

65
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:12,443
The energy from the sky and land,
and water that bridges between them.

66
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,323
It took me ten years to master them all

67
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,364
and reach Chisu.

68
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,525
That is incredible.

69
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:24,323
It took me 13 years.

70
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,697
And it took Yeom twice as long.

71
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:31,247
I was the second fastest after Jang Gang.

72
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:32,918
But you see…

73
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:44,220
We say this energy flows
between heaven and earth.

74
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:47,722
But in fact, this is just water.

75
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:54,559
It took us over ten years
to finally grasp this energy.

76
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,937
But there are those
who can do that from birth.

77
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,627
Simply put, they are geniuses.

78
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,714
But to the world,

79
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:25,508
they seem reckless, unreliable,

80
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:28,223
and even dangerous at times.

81
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:32,596
Did I just

82
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,306
reach Chisu?

83
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:41,109
That is because
they are different from the rest of us.

84
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,075
Some could be jealous of them.

85
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,338
While others could be worried about them.

86
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,416
I will definitely win tomorrow.

87
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,467
I caught it.

88
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,018
Really?

89
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:14,773
Uk.

90
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,062
You have reached Chisu.

91
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:26,896
We react that way because we do not know
how they will use their terrifying powers.

92
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:31,530
Will he save this world
like Master Seo Gyeong did?

93
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:34,997
Or will he do the very opposite?
We do not know.

94
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,615
So are you saying

95
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,998
that you will continue to watch him?

96
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:47,128
Do not worry. I am debating as well.

97
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:51,345
If we need to get rid of that power,

98
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:55,095
I will do so with my own hands.

99
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,984
Uk, is your probation period over?

100
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:05,316
That is why I am back.

101
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:06,821
So you destroyed Cheonbugwan?

102
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,153
Do not exaggerate.

103
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,030
-Hey.
-You are finally back.

104
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:15,662
I am your final opponent.

105
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,659
-I see.
-I feel bad that

106
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:23,917
you will not be able to win
since I happen to be your last opponent.

107
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:30,803
You are right.

108
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,889
I hope the finale will not be boring.

109
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:35,812
I am counting on you.

110
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,235
What was that?

111
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:49,068
Did he undergo a new kind of training?

112
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,073
I heard he only went fishing.

113
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:53,565
Do not worry. He is just talking big.

114
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:58,787
I will humiliate him
in front of the Crown Prince today.

115
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:01,961
Your Royal Highness.

116
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,550
My foolish young master
lost nine duels so far

117
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:09,418
and thus made you lose
nine precious gold toads.

118
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,389
I do not deserve to look you in the eye.

119
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:16,222
Is there one duel left?

120
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,095
He trained hard,

121
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:20,522
so he will not disappoint you
this time around.

122
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,231
If I am not to be disappointed,

123
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:23,902
he should lose again.

124
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:31,074
You took me for a fool.

125
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:34,203
You were using my gold
to train your young master.

126
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,331
Thanks to the duels,

127
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:41,250
you had the satisfaction of watching
my young master get humiliated.

128
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,920
I believe that alone was worth the gold.

129
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,420
Yes, they were entertaining.

130
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,672
I hope he will lose this time again

131
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:52,013
so I can see you cry
after losing this to me.

132
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,885
Uk has the other half, does he not?

133
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:58,138
Since he had given this to you,

134
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:00,392
was this a symbol of love?

135
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,558
Did you give this up so you could use me?

136
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:11,319
If Uk loses and this becomes mine,

137
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:12,992
I will destroy it.

138
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,907
You must lose something as well.

139
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:17,867
What a pity.

140
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,240
Your heartwrenching love
will be thrown away.

141
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,961
Do as you please.

142
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,338
That jade did its job

143
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,590
by allowing my young master
to have ten duels.

144
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:34,722
Did you not say that
this was precious enough to bet your life?

145
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,468
If he and I shared feelings
worth betting my life on,

146
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:43,229
losing that would not affect
the feelings we have toward each other.

147
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,989
So you really do not care
if you lose this?

148
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,275
Fine.

149
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,700
Then I will throw this away.

150
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,747
So it really meant nothing to you.

151
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,875
Then you have deceived me.

152
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:15,263
You had said
it was your most precious belonging.

153
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:18,181
But if you do not care about it,
that means you have lied.

154
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,597
How will you pay for what you have done?

155
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,430
You said you have bet your life?

156
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,230
Fine.

157
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,730
This time, place yourself for the bet.

158
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,686
I already lost nine gold toads.

159
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:34,777
I do not wish to lose another.

160
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,610
The reward for this next duel

161
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:39,195
will be you.

162
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:43,195
Do as you please.

163
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:44,445
If Jang Uk loses,

164
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:48,373
you will be serving whoever beats him.

165
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,915
Yes, Your Royal Highness.
I will keep that in mind.

166
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:11,609
So you are Uk's last opponent?

167
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,612
I am Cha Beom.

168
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,402
I will defeat him no matter what.

169
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,195
You must win this duel.

170
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,820
If you fail,

171
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,576
I will see to it
that you never succeed in life as a mage.

172
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,331
Can you give me your word?

173
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,631
There are always variables in every duel…

174
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:32,839
Forget it!

175
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,261
I only need those
who will definitely win the duel.

176
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:37,718
Give me your word.

177
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:40,338
I am afraid I cannot do that,
Your Royal Highness.

178
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,086
No one expected him…

179
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,469
to defeat you either.

180
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:50,519
There is only one person who can beat him

181
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,194
at all costs.

182
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,272
It is Seo Yul.

183
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:01,487
Seo Yul.

184
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,246
The bet started as nothing serious.

185
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,087
But I am beyond annoyed at this point.

186
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:23,683
I spent nine gold toads
just to put that arrogant Uk in his place.

187
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:27,641
Imagine how ridiculous I will look

188
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:31,603
if he happens to win the final match
due to some bizarre reason.

189
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,725
So I need someone
who can beat him for certain.

190
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:38,484
As the best mage of Jeongjingak
and my cousin,

191
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,027
I believe you are the only one.

192
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:44,985
I know you two are very close.

193
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:50,162
But as the Crown Prince and your cousin,

194
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,503
could you help me out this once?

195
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,625
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

196
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:00,762
Really?

197
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,884
You will fight Uk for me?

198
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:05,678
I will win.

199
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:07,847
I give you my word.

200
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:12,484
That is right.
You of all people can do that.

201
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,940
Did Mu-deok really promise to serve

202
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,860
whoever beat Uk?

203
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,569
Yes. Instead of the gold toad…

204
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,663
She decided to put herself as the bet.

205
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,700
Then I will beat Uk

206
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:31,827
and take her in as my maid.

207
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,495
All right, then.

208
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,547
The person fighting Jang Uk
for his last duel. Step forward.

209
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:09,834
Uk.

210
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,790
The person you will be fighting against

211
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:14,745
is me.

212
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:37,016
Yul could not have volunteered
just so he could let Uk win, right?

213
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,102
No way.

214
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:41,267
When Dang-gu volunteered,
Uk refused to fight him.

215
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,777
He will not let Uk win.

216
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:46,398
He gave the Crown Prince his word
and said he would beat Uk.

217
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:51,908
You may begin.

218
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,224
Yul was right.

219
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:11,096
Uk has greatly improved.

220
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,530
That is my shield spell.

221
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:28,741
When did he master that?

222
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:33,332
He just picked them up
through his previous duels.

223
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:37,329
Did he master all of his opponents' spells
from his previous nine duels?

224
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:41,173
He has learned and is mimicking
some spells from his previous duels.

225
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,346
He did it.

226
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,847
The duel has ended.

227
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,432
Seo Yul has won.

228
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:27,693
I knew it.

229
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,898
Uk lost all ten duels.

230
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:35,664
How did he use Tansu at the end?

231
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:38,779
He collected the energy in the air
and turned it into water.

232
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:39,787
That is absurd.

233
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:43,412
Only those
who have reached Chisu can do that.

234
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,223
When did you reach Chisu?

235
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:01,523
I told you yesterday that
I had something surprising to tell you.

236
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:03,058
That is incredible.

237
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,231
Congratulations.

238
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,190
Uk!

239
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:09,647
You have reached Chisu.
Congratulations, my friend!

240
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:11,609
Did you see that?

241
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,954
Our fellow mage, Jang Uk,
has reached Chisu!

242
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,030
-Really?
-Hey.

243
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:20,075
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

244
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,619
-You are amazing.
-Congratulations!

245
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:23,793
Hey!

246
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,455
Let us head to Sejukwon.

247
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:38,217
Mu-deok just left with the Crown Prince.

248
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:41,472
They are probably
putting an end to their bet.

249
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:44,215
I am just worried they may be
up to something ridiculous again.

250
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:45,978
I will go and check.

251
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:49,559
Yes. You should take care of her.
After all, you are now her owner.

252
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,112
That is what we want
the Crown Prince to think.

253
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,775
So Yul can go to see Mu-deok.

254
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,616
Uk, come with me to Sejukwon.

255
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,327
Let us go. Hurry.

256
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,540
-Be careful. Come on.
-That hurts.

257
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,134
Watch out.

258
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:19,425
Like you said, my young master
was defeated ten times.

259
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,852
You have won, Your Royal Highness.

260
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:26,391
You already knew
that he had reached Chisu.

261
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:30,766
That is why you did not hesitate
to place yourself as the bet.

262
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:33,074
Had Master Cha Beom competed
like he was supposed to,

263
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,402
my young master would have won.

264
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,488
He is no longer your young master.

265
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:42,374
You will be serving Yul from now on.

266
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:48,044
You said you two shared
quite intimate feelings.

267
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,463
All right.

268
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,961
I hope you continue doing that
while serving a new owner.

269
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,780
That is ridiculous.

270
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:20,149
How could he have reached Chisu already?

271
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:22,857
It is true. We all witnessed it.

272
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,370
Is this true?

273
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,271
My goodness!

274
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,774
He is truly incredible!

275
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,398
Uk, look at you!

276
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,654
-That hurts!
-Sorry!

277
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,356
Master Heo, I am in pain.

278
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:07,198
You stepped up because you were worried

279
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,414
that I might have to serve
Master Cha Beom, right?

280
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,834
Thank you so much for your kindness.

281
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:13,713
You will be serving me from now on.

282
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,380
That was a promise
I had made for the duel.

283
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,665
I need to pretend
to keep up with my promise.

284
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:20,835
Of course.

285
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:24,432
Feel free to let me know
if you need me to run any errands.

286
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:25,679
I will not need anything from you.

287
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:28,349
You can visit Uk whenever you want.

288
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:31,393
However,

289
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:34,596
there is one thing I ask of you.

290
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:39,611
Once I complete my training here
and return to Seoho Fortress,

291
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,607
there is someone
I would like to take with me.

292
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,488
Please help me

293
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:47,947
do that.

294
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:52,245
I did not know you had someone like that.

295
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:55,619
Give me your word.
Promise that you will help me.

296
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:02,418
You are asking me this favor as my owner.

297
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:05,046
I will do so at all costs.

298
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:19,314
There is a soul shifter
in Sejukwon right now.

299
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:21,147
So how could you bring Uk here?

300
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,573
What could I have done? He was hurt.

301
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:27,322
I told him to rest up for a few days.

302
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:30,655
-Is he badly hurt?
-No.

303
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,162
It is nothing serious.

304
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:36,915
How reckless of him to fight against Yul.

305
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:39,538
We should have just let him
keep fishing with Master Lee.

306
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:41,286
We should not have summoned him.

307
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:45,882
They must have done
more than just fishing.

308
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:51,053
Uk reached Chisu.

309
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:52,888
What?

310
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:55,767
Is that not incredible?

311
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,271
How unbelievable.

312
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:59,232
He is indeed extraordinary.

313
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,532
What have you been learning

314
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:14,235
while fishing

315
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:15,947
with Master Lee?

316
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,502
I learned how to catch a Golden Fish.

317
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:22,923
So he was determined
to help you reach Chisu.

318
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:26,593
-Has he taken you in as his pupil?
-No, Master Heo.

319
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:28,633
There is a reason
why he is taking care of me.

320
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,973
And what could that be?

321
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,970
Was there something

322
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:37,885
that…

323
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:40,726
he told you about?

324
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:44,477
It was regarding a family matter.

325
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,986
I caught onto it and asked him first.

326
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:54,451
It seems like you are already aware of it.

327
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,205
I had hoped…

328
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:01,788
you would not find out.

329
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:03,959
No.

330
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:07,264
It was not something I could turn
a blind eye to upon finding out.

331
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,183
What will you do?

332
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:15,971
About Maidservant Kim.

333
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:25,821
What about her?

334
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:28,569
Master Lee is trying to win
Maidservant Kim over

335
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,612
by treating me well.

336
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,487
So what will you do?

337
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:39,249
I mean, Master Lee is a wonderful man
who has helped me greatly.

338
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:41,712
But still…

339
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:46,127
I thought I should give you
the opportunity first,

340
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,801
given our history together.

341
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:53,009
What opportunity?

342
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:57,215
Did you know that Master Lee
has recently been staying at our house?

343
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:00,928
I was wondering where he was staying.

344
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:03,227
So he has been staying at your house.

345
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:04,311
Yes.

346
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:07,566
Since I am away, they must be enjoying
a lovely meal together.

347
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,729
Since she has a soft heart,

348
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:12,318
she loves providing for
and feeding others.

349
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,824
It is only a matter of time
until she falls for him.

350
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,618
I truly hope

351
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:21,542
she can marry a loving man.

352
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,536
If it is fine with you,

353
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:30,207
I would like to root for them.

354
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:46,732
Master Lee is unbelievably older than her.

355
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:50,574
But on the outside,
he looks younger than you.

356
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,190
It is still absurd.

357
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:55,487
He practices chastity while training.

358
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:58,124
How could they get married?

359
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:02,250
I had cut off my libido to train,
but I have since recovered.

360
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:03,869
It is not impossible.

361
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,995
Marriage should be consensual.

362
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,210
She needs to want it as well.

363
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,964
She has been in love

364
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:15,763
with a certain individual
for all these years.

365
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:18,388
Jin.

366
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:24,430
Do you really think
she is still in love with Jang Gang?

367
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,733
I know her the best.

368
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:32,284
So please do not assume things.

369
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,739
Goodness.

370
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,871
You call others slow-witted

371
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:41,408
when you are the slow one.

372
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,873
You know nothing!

373
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:46,293
It has been ages
since she stopped loving Jang Gang.

374
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,230
He was here

375
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,148
last time as well.

376
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:22,079
It is freshly-made quince tea.

377
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:23,238
It is fragrant.

378
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:27,749
Is it not good to keep
withered flowers at home.

379
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:30,081
It is not easy to find flowers
since it is colder now.

380
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,712
But I should listen to you
and throw them out.

381
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,705
I liked how the flowers

382
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:37,667
kept me company.

383
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:55,020
I completely forgot about the cups
and only brought the kettle.

384
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:03,624
How did they come back to life?

385
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:06,584
Was it Master Lee?

386
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:09,368
How beautiful.

387
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,015
He must have been

388
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:31,225
the one who gave her

389
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,444
those wildflowers too.

390
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:45,582
You are truly kind and warmhearted.

391
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,621
Am I?

392
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,786
Feel free to stay here
as long as you want.

393
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:52,622
I will cater to you as best as I can.

394
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:55,424
Thank you.

395
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:01,130
Was she Jang Gang's wife?

396
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:06,638
Yes. She is very beautiful, is she not?

397
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:10,391
She must be the woman Jin
was head over heels with as Yeom said.

398
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:19,028
She has not withered away
and is still just as beautiful.

399
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,529
Perhaps that is why
he still cannot forget her.

400
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:26,278
Or perhaps,

401
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:28,656
he just does not like me.

402
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,704
I do not know.

403
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,915
I understand it was
the Crown Prince's command.

404
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:41,263
But how could he forbid me
from visiting Mu-deok?

405
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,169
She must be worried sick about me.

406
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:45,838
I am sure she is just busy.

407
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:47,717
I told her you were doing fine.

408
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:48,724
No.

409
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:51,215
Do you think
she would be relieved after hearing that?

410
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:52,930
She needs to see me in person.

411
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:55,022
Come here.

412
00:30:58,064 --> 00:30:59,984
Seeing her will only hurt you.

413
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:05,993
I use this homing bird
to send letters to Seoho Fortress.

414
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:12,910
It would take three to four days
for a horse to arrive there.

415
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,656
Does this bird really fly that far?

416
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:16,368
How incredible.

417
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:30,965
Do you have the whistle I gave you?

418
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:34,676
I am sorry. I do not carry it with me.

419
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,356
It was given to you
by the person you are in love with.

420
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,270
I am hurt.

421
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,830
The homing bird will return
after two long blows on this whistle.

422
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:57,542
You seemed to be good at this.

423
00:31:58,124 --> 00:31:59,334
Give it a try.

424
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,200
There.

425
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:34,826
The bird has returned.

426
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:38,753
Now, do two short ones.

427
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:04,436
I only said that to put him at ease.

428
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:07,244
He was worried that his pet bird
might have suffered during the winter,

429
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,782
so I told him that.

430
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:15,033
See? Mu-deok is doing well.

431
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:21,078
Wait. Uk.

432
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:24,375
What exactly did the Crown Prince
and Mu-deok bet on?

433
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,840
The thing you wanted to get.

434
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:31,178
It does not matter.
I cannot get it now since I lost.

435
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:41,642
But how could she look
so nonchalant after losing it?

436
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:52,164
-So what was it?
-Do not ask.

437
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:56,369
Why have you not once visited Uk
in Sejukwon?

438
00:33:57,785 --> 00:34:00,535
There is no need to mind me
just because I am your new owner.

439
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,172
That is not why.

440
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:05,666
I am just trying not to be shameless.

441
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:19,716
So you really do not care
if you lose this?

442
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:26,811
I must find it.
I need to find it by tonight.

443
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:30,937
Only then can I see him without shame.

444
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:44,285
I knew it.

445
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,002
Uk has cut off his libido.

446
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:52,923
He dishonored the mages and ran away.

447
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:56,797
It was odd how he improved so quickly
and beat the Crown Prince.

448
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:59,256
He chose to become Master Lee's pupil

449
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,097
and has practiced chastity.

450
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:02,602
Did you all see Master Lee?

451
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,604
He was Master Seo Gyeong's pupil,

452
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:06,475
and Master Heo was his pupil.

453
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:08,692
But he looks younger than our leader.

454
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:11,193
That is because he practiced chastity.

455
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:15,105
I heard he does not age because he reached
a high degree at such a young age.

456
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:18,236
Really? I heard he became young again
thanks to a spell.

457
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:19,204
A spell?

458
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:22,203
Whatever the case may be,
Uk sure is determined.

459
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:23,746
So what if he has reached Chisu?

460
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,670
If it were me,

461
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,542
I would have never practiced chastity.

462
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:31,843
Of course not. Me neither.

463
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,761
-He is so persistent.
-Tell me about it.

464
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:38,681
They are just jealous.

465
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:43,811
Young Master Jang is subjected
to all sorts of horrible rumors.

466
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:52,941
I was able

467
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:57,164
to get some much-needed sleep lately
thanks to her medicine.

468
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:02,954
I am glad
that your herbal medicine is effective.

469
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:07,495
I used the valerian that I got
from the wetlands of Wol Fortress.

470
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,382
It is known for its calming effect.

471
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:13,248
It must have helped you relax
and fall asleep better.

472
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:16,256
I can see why Master Heo recommended you.

473
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:20,177
Thankfully, I am now able
to get some sleep.

474
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:23,561
But the ringing in my ears
and the splitting headache still remain.

475
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:26,019
They have worsened
after the news of the soul shifter

476
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,890
surprised you last month.

477
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:30,517
A soul shifter tried to enter the palace.

478
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:33,435
There could easily be one in here already.

479
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,435
Assistant Gwanju Jin Mu

480
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,526
strengthened the security,
so do not worry.

481
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:40,242
The soul shifter who tried to enter
the palace was one of his men.

482
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,120
There were also rumors

483
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,160
about a soul shifter
being spotted in Cheonbugwan.

484
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:48,746
I cannot trust anyone.

485
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:54,996
It seems like your anxiety
stems from your heart, Your Majesty.

486
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:58,587
What do you think about finding
an alternative way to calm yourself?

487
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:03,135
Do you know Hemp Master Lee?

488
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,261
The last pupil of Master Seo Gyeong.

489
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:07,928
I have heard of him

490
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:09,977
but only saw him once in Songrim.

491
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:14,980
My grandfather was his pupil,
so I have heard stories about him.

492
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:19,026
He may be able to relieve your anxiety.

493
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:21,817
Are you saying he can tell

494
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,986
if there is a soul shifter around me?

495
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,615
I do not know him that well
since I have not met him.

496
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:30,332
Perhaps you could invite him
to your palace and ask for his help.

497
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,594
I told you to clean her room every day!

498
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:41,223
How could you let the water
in this vase rot?

499
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,470
I am sorry, my lady!

500
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:46,007
Imagine if Bu-yeon returned

501
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,137
and saw this vase full of stagnant water.

502
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:49,894
She would be disappointed in me.

503
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,555
Change the bedsheets,

504
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:54,015
and get rid of that!

505
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,065
She cannot see,
so why would you place that there

506
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:57,818
and run the risk of her tripping?

507
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,955
Dozens of girls have come,

508
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,625
but none of them were Bu-yeon.

509
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:20,378
Being disappointed over and over again
must have made Mother easily distressed.

510
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:21,804
I agree.

511
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:25,547
But it will be your birthday soon.

512
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:31,556
-Here.
-What is this?

513
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:37,152
Father, they are so pretty.

514
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:40,781
But it is not my birthday yet.

515
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,490
I will get you
something prettier on your birthday.

516
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:47,452
I will try it on right now.
Please put it on for me.

517
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:50,041
Sure.

518
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:58,253
Let me see how pretty you are.

519
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:02,629
You always used to braid my hair
back when I was little.

520
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:11,061
Mother never did that.

521
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,437
I am sorry. Did that hurt a lot?

522
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,650
I am fine.

523
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:35,751
I must have lost my touch
since it had been a while.

524
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:36,831
I am sorry.

525
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:39,996
That is all right. Do I look pretty?

526
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:42,248
You are always beautiful.

527
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,828
Park Jin shot me with this bow.

528
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:22,094
I was defeated that day.

529
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:25,549
I cannot give any excuses
or take back the outcome of a fight.

530
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,052
But once I regain my strength,

531
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:34,011
I would like to have
a proper fight with him.

532
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,065
What are you doing?

533
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:50,534
I am cleaning, my lord.

534
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:54,115
Be careful what you touch.

535
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:57,872
Touch a weapon filled with the energy
of a high-degree mage,

536
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:00,745
and a girl like you could get hurt.

537
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:04,586
Even I am aware of that, my lord.

538
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:08,381
But I did wonder
why you would place this here

539
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:11,046
when I have to clean the desk.

540
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,885
I usually hang it up well.

541
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:16,142
I simply forgot.

542
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:17,933
But you are still young.

543
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:21,597
I cannot believe
you are already forgetful.

544
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:25,573
I am just worried as a member of Songrim.

545
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:28,649
What if you forget to pay me?

546
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:30,525
My lord.

547
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:34,123
Please be healthy. You are still young.

548
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:40,411
I will come back later to clean, my lord.

549
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,590
What a clever

550
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:51,011
and daring girl she is.

551
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:53,257
How did Mu-deok

552
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:56,354
and Uk first meet?

553
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:57,930
I do not know the details,

554
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:01,845
but I heard he paid her debt
and took her out of Chwiseonru.

555
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:04,056
Then go to Chwiseonru

556
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:06,766
and ask around about her.

557
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:11,033
Find out her background
and what kind of girl she is.

558
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:13,952
I am just curious that is all.

559
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:19,373
I do not know well either.

560
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:22,503
But the broker who brought her here
is in the capital at the moment.

561
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:25,211
I will tell him to go to Songrim.

562
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:30,046
Hey, you there.

563
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:34,218
We met in Sari Village, right?

564
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:36,512
What is it this time?

565
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:37,755
So-i.

566
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:39,806
Have you not seen her in the capital?

567
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:42,597
Do you know where she could be?

568
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:45,765
I do not know.
She is not a native of Sari Village.

569
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:49,605
She only stayed for a few months
and then stole the villagers' belongings.

570
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:51,072
Let me know if you catch her.

571
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:58,493
Where can I find her?

572
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:03,463
Darn it.

573
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:06,576
You have made some bad friends, So-i.

574
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:11,125
Could she have gone to find Mu-deok?

575
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:17,223
I will take you to Jinyowon soon.

576
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:19,893
But there is something
we need to take care of first.

577
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:32,275
Here. Eat this.

578
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:34,529
You took my purse, right?

579
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:35,862
Give me back my ring.

580
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:44,367
Are they the ones you met in the capital?

581
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:47,495
That is correct,
but why did you bring them here?

582
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,383
I love that you are persistent and smart.

583
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:52,839
But that is also what makes you dangerous.

584
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:55,922
There is something I want you to see.

585
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:13,943
Assistant Gwanju.

586
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:17,275
Thank you for feeding me.

587
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:20,467
Be afraid.

588
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:24,471
Betray me or get your cover blown,
and you will meet the same fate.

589
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:31,404
All right.

590
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:34,984
Tell me if there is anyone else
who will recognize you.

591
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:36,822
I must get rid of them.

592
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:39,698
Is there anyone else?

593
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:44,827
Yes, my lord.

594
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:51,793
Search thoroughly.
I definitely threw it in there.

595
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,254
I cannot find it.

596
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:56,134
Search over there.

597
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:58,961
I had searched that area thoroughly,
but there was nothing.

598
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:00,757
Look again.

599
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:02,221
I can barely see--

600
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:04,595
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

601
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:07,097
I am pretty sure it is in here somewhere.

602
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:08,851
Yes, look over there.

603
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:14,767
What are you doing?

604
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:18,282
It is none of your business. Go on.

605
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:22,993
I am afraid Eunuch Oh
will needlessly suffer.

606
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:26,661
So I must say something. May I?

607
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:28,292
What is it?

608
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:30,663
Could you possibly

609
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:32,785
be looking

610
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:35,132
for this?

611
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:37,710
You found it?

612
00:46:37,794 --> 00:46:41,224
I searched day and night
and found it not too long ago.

613
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:47,264
You threw it away.

614
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:50,520
Since I picked it up,
it is mine once again.

615
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:52,023
Goodness.

616
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:57,265
Eunuch Oh, you can stop and come out.

617
00:46:58,607 --> 00:46:59,897
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

618
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:02,531
Darn it.

619
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:06,320
Thanks to you,
I retrieved something precious.

620
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:10,077
I owe this all to you,
Your Royal Highness.

621
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:12,702
That is right.

622
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:16,748
I did not destroy it
or throw it too far away.

623
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:19,343
You only found it
because I threw it nearby.

624
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:24,929
If I may dare to try to understand you,

625
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:28,138
could you be giving yourself credit
and being grumpy

626
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:30,260
because you feel bad?

627
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:33,849
As Filthy Mu-deok,
you ought to just listen to what I say.

628
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:35,734
How dare you try to understand me?

629
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:37,771
I apologize, Your Royal Highness.

630
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:42,146
Your Royal Highness.

631
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:47,066
Your Royal Highness.

632
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:50,825
Master Heo told me to tell you
that Master Lee is here.

633
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:53,079
All right. Is he at Sejukwon?

634
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:56,621
Yes, Your Royal Highness.
His pupil, Jang Uk, is with him.

635
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:00,837
It is said that Uk
made such sudden progress

636
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:02,839
thanks to Master Lee's bizarre training.

637
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:04,671
If that were not the case,

638
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:06,876
he would not have been able
to hold a candle to you.

639
00:48:09,886 --> 00:48:10,846
Let us go.

640
00:48:22,941 --> 00:48:25,441
You are now serving Seo Yul
instead of Jang Uk.

641
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:28,489
Had I competed and beat Uk,

642
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:30,282
you would have served me instead.

643
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:32,155
Had you competed instead,

644
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:35,868
there would have been no chance
of you becoming my owner.

645
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:38,674
I would have let him win out of pity.

646
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:40,669
Do you not pity him?

647
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,421
Everyone in Songrim knows

648
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:44,762
that Uk is practicing chastity.

649
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:47,169
-Right?
-Do not feign ignorance.

650
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:48,547
You must know best.

651
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:51,184
Are you not the one who serves him

652
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:53,182
the chaste herb tea every day?

653
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:54,433
I have never done that.

654
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:57,604
How else did he reach Chisu so quickly?

655
00:48:58,977 --> 00:49:00,977
He is not even Jang Gang's real son.

656
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:06,034
His mother married into the Jang family
and gave birth to an illegitimate son.

657
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:09,355
Now, her son will end
his family's line for good.

658
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:14,487
His father blocked his gate of energy
so Uk would not carry on the family line.

659
00:49:14,576 --> 00:49:17,536
But he managed to open it again,
so he should at least be chaste.

660
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:19,535
That is true.

661
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:24,042
You are obnoxious and despicable.

662
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:25,458
What?

663
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:28,255
What did you just say?

664
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:32,178
-You heard me.
-How dare you?

665
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:35,218
-Say it again.
-Then you will hit me.

666
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:36,555
Tell me this instant!

667
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:40,194
Tell them.

668
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:51,697
If they must hear it,

669
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:55,580
make sure you tell them loud and clear.

670
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:04,463
You are obnoxious and despicable!

671
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:09,053
That is what she said. Did you get that?

672
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:10,513
-Yes, Your Royal Highness.
-Yes, Your Royal Highness.

673
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:14,341
Mu-deok, I had given you something.

674
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:15,598
Show them.

675
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:24,227
I had bestowed that sachet to you.

676
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:28,442
If someone hits, swears,
or mistreats you while I am not around,

677
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:30,315
you must tell me.

678
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:32,530
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

679
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:35,874
You may go.

680
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:47,633
It is foolish of you to make an enemy

681
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:51,301
of someone so powerful out of jealousy.

682
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:02,394
You have ink on your shoulder.

683
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:05,769
You can erase that black ink
with white rice.

684
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:09,112
The two colors may contrast one another.

685
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:12,571
But mix them together,
and they will get rid of that stain.

686
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:14,695
Those were some wise words.

687
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:17,867
Where did you read that,
Your Royal Highness?

688
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:20,736
Somewhere.

689
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:23,077
It is something you may see
on a highly competitive exam.

690
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:39,432
Is my young master not here?

691
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:45,729
I heard you were injured.
Are you better now?

692
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:49,271
Yes, thanks to you.
Thank you for sending me the medicine.

693
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:55,364
Maidservant Kim invited me over
for dinner recently.

694
00:51:56,696 --> 00:51:59,776
Can you join us?

695
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:01,662
Sure.

696
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:06,707
Then I will set a date and tell Mu-deok.

697
00:52:07,582 --> 00:52:09,082
Do you know my maid?

698
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:12,207
There was a time
when I visited you but left

699
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:13,915
without being able to see you.

700
00:52:14,714 --> 00:52:17,264
That day, she was in your room.

701
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:24,143
Do not go.

702
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:27,140
Do not go to your room and just stay here.

703
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:29,903
I will bring you your clothes.

704
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:33,022
What was that?

705
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,240
Was she making a move on me?

706
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:37,317
What do you mean?

707
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:40,369
It is nothing.

708
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:48,497
Wait.

709
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:51,789
Stay still.

710
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:53,922
It left.

711
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:56,093
-Did it?
-Yes.

712
00:52:58,216 --> 00:53:00,136
-It has left.
-I was so startled.

713
00:53:13,189 --> 00:53:14,319
Mu-deok.

714
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:32,964
Mu-deok, we meet again.

715
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:38,259
Take care of yourself.

716
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,670
I will see you at the palace.

717
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:41,088
Right.

718
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:56,268
What is it? Did you run here?

719
00:53:57,192 --> 00:53:58,112
I did.

720
00:53:58,193 --> 00:54:00,863
It took you long enough to visit me
after learning that I was hurt.

721
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:01,776
What is it?

722
00:54:01,863 --> 00:54:04,163
What could be more shocking
than serving someone else?

723
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,200
It is not that.

724
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:07,243
The other mages were gossiping about you.

725
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:08,497
I wanted to know the truth.

726
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:10,908
I see. So you heard about it as well.

727
00:54:10,997 --> 00:54:12,747
Why rush over
when you know it is not true?

728
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:16,132
Who knows? You even caught
a Golden Fish while I was away.

729
00:54:16,878 --> 00:54:19,048
You could have become
Master Lee's pupil for all I know.

730
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:21,260
What? That is definitely not true.

731
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:22,381
Forget it.

732
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:24,467
I even suggested it to you.

733
00:54:25,261 --> 00:54:26,891
I guess it cannot be helped.

734
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:28,852
How can I prove it to you?

735
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:31,346
You said it could not be helped.

736
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:42,152
See?

737
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:46,066
I am not a woman to you.

738
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:49,197
If you want to prove it,
go embrace that pretty lady.

739
00:54:50,578 --> 00:54:52,618
Then should I really do it?

740
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:55,882
Yes. Do it.

741
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:57,629
You better not say otherwise.

742
00:54:57,711 --> 00:54:59,091
Fine, do it!

743
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:36,000
You told me to attack

744
00:55:36,082 --> 00:55:38,462
when my opponent least expects it.

745
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:43,007
I have followed your teachings, my master.

746
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,600
Fine. Well done. I am proud of you.

747
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:52,017
By the way,

748
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:56,310
I heard you ran into her
in my room last time.

749
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,560
What about it?

750
00:55:59,647 --> 00:56:01,357
Is that why you stopped me from going?

751
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:06,703
Did that happen?

752
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:09,030
I do not remember.

753
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:11,831
Understanding you is much harder
than controlling

754
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:13,290
Lake Gyeongcheondaeho's energy.

755
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:16,496
You were pulling me in, were you not?

756
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,500
Master, I am going to the palace today.

757
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:23,456
The King invited Master Lee,

758
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:26,169
and I will be accompanying him.

759
00:56:26,257 --> 00:56:28,887
I had wanted to see the Queen
once again and it worked out.

760
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:31,176
Be safe.

761
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:35,312
I will. I will tell you everything
once I return.

762
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:44,324
Uk.

763
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:49,913
I found this.

764
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:55,658
I just so happened to find it.
I thought I should tell you.

765
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:58,924
Go.

766
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:20,598
Why would the leader of Songrim
look for me?

767
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:23,726
-Do you remember Mu-deok?
-Yes.

768
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:26,815
He wants to know
about her time in Sari Village.

769
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:30,161
He could just ask her directly. Why me?

770
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:31,198
She is here.

771
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:33,741
She is not. She is in Songrim.

772
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:34,945
She is?

773
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:38,583
What could a blind girl be doing there?

774
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:43,424
Master Lee wanted you two and Jang Uk

775
00:57:43,501 --> 00:57:45,341
to accompany him to the palace.

776
00:57:46,504 --> 00:57:47,844
Uk too?

777
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:50,470
Is he all better now?

778
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:52,430
We need to leave right away. Get ready.

779
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:03,397
Please be careful at the palace.

780
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,860
The ice stone is there.

781
00:58:07,525 --> 00:58:09,105
I am aware of that.

782
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:12,364
Since they are shamelessly hiding it,

783
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:15,407
I have decided to be brazen
as well and make my move.

784
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:23,577
The last time I was invited to the palace,

785
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:26,587
you were this little.

786
00:58:27,128 --> 00:58:30,128
I remember enjoying the candies

787
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:32,505
you had brought from there.

788
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:33,762
By the way,

789
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:37,974
should you not prepare
a gift for His Majesty?

790
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:40,016
I have prepared one already.

791
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:40,979
Yeom.

792
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:43,899
Send the gift over to the palace on time.

793
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:45,518
Yes, master.

794
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:47,185
Was it between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m.?

795
00:58:47,273 --> 00:58:48,693
Between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m., you fool.

796
00:58:49,275 --> 00:58:51,025
Right. I am sorry.

797
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:53,736
Write it down so you will not forget.

798
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:56,156
You used to be easily distracted.

799
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:59,161
Now that you have aged,
you have become forgetful as well.

800
00:59:01,454 --> 00:59:02,584
Let us go.

801
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:04,751
-Goodbye, master.
-Goodbye, master.

802
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:08,629
I just cannot get used to seeing that.

803
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,370
Mu-deok.

804
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:41,873
The leader would like to see you.

805
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:44,539
The leader?

806
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:54,423
Mu-deok.

807
01:00:07,645 --> 01:00:12,145
Everything about you
has been exposed by this man over here.

808
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:16,699
I told him about your eyes.

809
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:22,834
Will my cover get blown?

810
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:27,124
My lord, you see…

811
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:31,128
She was not the only one who lied.

812
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:36,132
Her grandmother begged me,
so I played along with it.

813
01:00:36,924 --> 01:00:40,304
Her family has always been poor.

814
01:00:40,386 --> 01:00:42,306
She lied about being blind

815
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:45,349
to avoid getting sold off to pay the debt.

816
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:47,643
It is something like
those who pretend to limp

817
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:49,687
to avoid fighting at war.

818
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:53,571
Why did you lie about being blind
when you were sold off to Chwiseonru?

819
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:58,610
She was planning to run away.

820
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,120
Sure, she was sold off due to the debt.

821
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:04,659
But it would have been easier
to run away if she pretended to be blind.

822
01:01:05,286 --> 01:01:07,616
-Right?
-That is correct.

823
01:01:07,705 --> 01:01:10,665
I was on the run
when I first met Young Master Jang.

824
01:01:11,376 --> 01:01:14,046
He took pity and took me in.

825
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:19,093
I am sorry for lying, my lord.

826
01:01:20,301 --> 01:01:21,551
What I did was wrong.

827
01:01:22,887 --> 01:01:24,347
Other than lying about that,

828
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:26,270
she has never done anything wrong.

829
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:30,059
She has always been
a great granddaughter and a kind girl.

830
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:43,993
Why did you lie for me?

831
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:48,036
I just did my money's worth.

832
01:01:48,621 --> 01:01:49,911
Your money's worth?

833
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:54,997
But are you really not blind?

834
01:01:58,214 --> 01:01:59,094
But then again,

835
01:01:59,173 --> 01:02:02,643
I did find it odd from the beginning.

836
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:05,756
-What?
-Despite being blind,

837
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:08,097
you always recognized
whoever was in front of you.

838
01:02:08,182 --> 01:02:10,232
You even knew
whether it would snow or rain.

839
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:15,310
Many villagers thought
you were lying about being blind.

840
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:18,318
They were creeped out and avoided you.

841
01:02:19,485 --> 01:02:21,145
-I see.
-Anyway,

842
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:23,697
come to the ferry inn
if you ever need my help again.

843
01:02:23,781 --> 01:02:24,821
All right?

844
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:26,485
Right.

845
01:02:27,034 --> 01:02:29,334
Did you meet with So-i?

846
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:31,583
So-i?

847
01:02:31,664 --> 01:02:33,674
She is in the capital right now.

848
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,540
Some thugs were looking for her.

849
01:02:35,626 --> 01:02:38,046
I wonder what she did this time.

850
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:41,419
She was the one who robbed your house
after your grandmother passed away.

851
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:44,388
Do not get involved with her.

852
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:47,049
It seems you are also hiding things
Songrim does not know.

853
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:51,641
You said you did your money's worth.
Who paid you?

854
01:02:51,726 --> 01:02:52,806
Ju-wol.

855
01:02:57,732 --> 01:02:59,232
You do not need to thank me.

856
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:01,784
It was Young Master Jang's money.

857
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:11,120
If anyone asks or seeks Mu-deok,

858
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:12,334
use this money.

859
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:16,078
And of course, half of it is yours.

860
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:19,671
I was not hiding something heinous either.

861
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:21,674
I got my share as well.

862
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:24,547
And I like you.

863
01:03:25,551 --> 01:03:27,221
I am truly grateful.

864
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:30,013
So what really happened to your eyes?

865
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:36,191
Forget it.

866
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:37,980
You must have your reasons.

867
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:46,857
Had Uk not taken any measures beforehand,
Park Jin would have found out.

868
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:50,120
If I get caught,
I will be putting Uk in danger as well.

869
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:07,261
Welcome, Master Lee Cheol.

870
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:10,467
I am grateful
for your invitation, Your Majesty.

871
01:04:12,723 --> 01:04:14,643
Did that wench Shaman Choi

872
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:17,186
tell you to kill me?

873
01:04:20,439 --> 01:04:22,649
Shaman Choi.

874
01:04:22,733 --> 01:04:24,493
Could that be who the Queen really is?

875
01:04:30,783 --> 01:04:31,833
Mu-deok.

876
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:37,078
That So-i you were talking about.

877
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:40,327
It could have been her who came by
looking for you a few days ago.

878
01:04:41,586 --> 01:04:43,706
I heard she was dangerous, so be careful.

879
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:50,053
I will not be able to recognize her
since I do not know her face.

880
01:04:50,595 --> 01:04:52,845
Should I have asked that man for details?

881
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:56,099
Come to the ferry inn
if you ever need my help again.

882
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:58,766
Ferry inn.

883
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:09,159
Everything about you
has been exposed by this man over here.

884
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:30,554
Is Broker Kim from Sari Village here?

885
01:05:30,635 --> 01:05:32,465
Yes, he just arrived.

886
01:05:32,970 --> 01:05:34,560
He is in the last room
on the second floor.

887
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:43,653
Mister, it is me, Mu-deok.

888
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:11,383
Mister.

889
01:06:24,271 --> 01:06:25,731
Master Lee.

890
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:28,605
If you were Master Seo Gyeong's pupil,

891
01:06:28,693 --> 01:06:30,743
you must be well over a century old.

892
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:33,450
So how do you maintain
such a youthful appearance?

893
01:06:34,031 --> 01:06:37,161
How old do I look, Your Majesty?

894
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:40,869
You look like
you are in your mid-thirties.

895
01:06:40,955 --> 01:06:43,575
At most, forty years old.

896
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:48,087
You are right. That is my biological age.

897
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:49,955
What?

898
01:06:50,047 --> 01:06:52,837
My soul is over a century old.

899
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:56,426
My body from birth
had turned into ashes long ago.

900
01:06:56,512 --> 01:06:59,182
This body did not originally belong to me.

901
01:07:01,392 --> 01:07:02,272
Wait.

902
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:05,769
Does that mean you have switched bodies?

903
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:06,855
That is correct.

904
01:07:07,898 --> 01:07:10,278
I am a soul shifter.

905
01:07:18,951 --> 01:07:20,241
Your Majesty.

906
01:07:20,327 --> 01:07:24,457
Did you not summon me today
to find the soul shifter?

907
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:26,211
I will do just that.

908
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:30,166
I can recognize soul shifters.

909
01:07:41,515 --> 01:07:45,555
He knew from the beginning
that Mu-deok was a soul shifter.

910
01:08:10,711 --> 01:08:11,591
You must be the one

911
01:08:12,797 --> 01:08:14,377
who killed him.

912
01:08:56,924 --> 01:08:58,554
What were all those bodies?

913
01:08:58,634 --> 01:09:01,054
What kind of life has Mu-deok led?

914
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:03,927
Mu-deok is hiding something

915
01:09:04,014 --> 01:09:06,814
-that must not be revealed.
-My goodness!

916
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:09,645
Instead, it will let you know by barking.

917
01:09:10,396 --> 01:09:14,106
As expected, there are
more soul shifters within the palace.

918
01:09:14,191 --> 01:09:16,691
If it is revealed that King's Star
was created by sorcery,

919
01:09:16,777 --> 01:09:19,197
it will spell the end of Songrim.

920
01:09:19,738 --> 01:09:20,568
It is dangerous.

921
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:23,236
You may not know her,
but she knows who Mu-deok is.

922
01:09:23,325 --> 01:09:24,485
We need Jang Gang.

923
01:09:24,577 --> 01:09:27,077
We will have to wait
until he returns of his own accord.

924
01:09:28,372 --> 01:09:29,962
Mu-deok, what are you doing here?

925
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:32,250
I cannot leave Young Master Jang.

926
01:09:32,334 --> 01:09:35,504
Keep loving me to death.

927
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:42,850
