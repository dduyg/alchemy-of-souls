1
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:37,954
Who are you and why are you following me?

2
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:39,747
I said…

3
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,126
who are you?

4
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:05,023
Seeing that you recognize this sword,

5
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:06,816
you must be a mage.

6
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,196
Put down your sword.

7
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:16,910
It is dangerous to unsheathe
a sword of Cheonbugwan here.

8
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,956
This is Gaema Village.

9
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:26,127
Cheonbugwan mages who patrol for sorcery
are considered enemies.

10
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,047
If you get into a fight

11
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,591
and people find out that you are here,

12
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,677
you will not be safe.

13
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,686
It looks as though

14
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:46,439
you know who I am.

15
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:50,610
You carry the sword
of Cheonbugwan's Gwanju,

16
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,863
so you must be his son.

17
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:04,207
Does Uk not know
what his father looks like?

18
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:10,421
Are there no portraits of his father
like the one here of his mother?

19
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,882
We do not have any portraits
of the Gwanju.

20
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,802
Young Master never seemed
curious about him.

21
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:19,973
He only saw his father as a baby,
so there is no way he would remember.

22
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,351
He would not recognize his father

23
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:25,103
even if he were to run into him.

24
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:31,568
I only followed you
because I recognized the sword.

25
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,907
Do you know the owner of this sword?

26
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:43,246
The man who abandoned that sword
was a madman.

27
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,916
His wife had an affair and died.

28
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:51,129
Then he abandoned his own son
and public post and just ran away.

29
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:54,883
Jang Gang, the man who went mad.

30
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,805
Everyone secretly talks about him,

31
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,766
but no one has ever said that to my face.

32
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,895
Do you hold a grudge against him?

33
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:10,857
What if I do?

34
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:14,903
Will you take vengeance on me
on behalf of your father?

35
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:20,366
No.

36
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,410
Even if I am his son, it is not my place.

37
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:24,954
He would not want that.

38
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:30,043
Then why do you carry your father's sword?

39
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,128
If I go around
denying that he is my father,

40
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:34,213
it would make my mother

41
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:36,674
seem too pitiful.

42
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:41,888
Do-hwa…

43
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,061
Do-hwa was the biggest victim of it all.

44
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,572
Do you also know my mother?

45
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:05,078
Do-hwa was the most beautiful woman
in all of Daeho.

46
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:09,999
Everyone in Daeho knew who she was.

47
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,670
It seems like everyone in my family
is famous for something.

48
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:16,673
I must say,

49
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:20,301
I did not expect to run into anyone
who recognized me at a place like this.

50
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,790
This is where people
secretly practice sorcery

51
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,750
despite it being banned by Songrim.

52
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:57,213
What is the son of Cheonbugwan's Gwanju
doing at a place like this?

53
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,840
Well, I was told I would be able

54
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:02,010
to witness sorcery
such as curses and soul magic.

55
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,803
You are a mage of Jeongjingak,

56
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:06,347
yet you go around
in search of such sorcery?

57
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,725
Not exactly.

58
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,437
I am here to find a shaman
who performs such sorcery.

59
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,523
A shaman?

60
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,985
She was a shaman
who was very good at soul magic,

61
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,571
which bewitches souls
and drives people mad.

62
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,116
She was caught 20 years ago

63
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,453
by the mages of Cheonbugwan
and ran away after her house burned down.

64
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,874
What business do you have
with Shaman Choi?

65
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,460
How did you know that was Shaman Choi?

66
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,507
By any chance, were you
one of the Cheonbugwan mages

67
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:43,885
who worked with my father?

68
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:48,097
The Choi family was a family of mages

69
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:52,435
that was destroyed by Master Seo Gyeong
a long time ago.

70
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,606
Your curiosity will put you in danger.

71
00:05:57,356 --> 00:06:00,068
If you become consumed
by your curiosity for sorcery,

72
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:04,155
its darkness will take over your soul,

73
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:06,115
and you could end up losing everything.

74
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,744
Once that happens,

75
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,622
it will be too late to go back.

76
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:22,256
Stop looking for those
who perform sorcery.

77
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,426
The world does not approve of such things,

78
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:27,929
and you will never be forgiven.

79
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:35,812
Wait.

80
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,401
Here.

81
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:49,367
Are you hurt?

82
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,161
Yes, I am hurt.

83
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:56,541
I am damaged
to the very depths of my soul.

84
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,806
Did he end up that way because of sorcery?

85
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,130
Bu-yeon!

86
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:46,716
My goodness, Bu-yeon!

87
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:10,990
Did she just look at me?

88
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,952
I am sorry.

89
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:17,163
Could you pick up the cane for me?

90
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,500
She is the girl I ran into
in front of the house.

91
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,311
Mother!

92
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:46,983
Mother.

93
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,695
Is she really Bu-yeon?

94
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:53,032
Yes, she is your sister.

95
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,660
Bu-yeon.

96
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,918
Bu-yeon, let me take you to your room.

97
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:39,120
You are Jang Uk's maid.

98
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,872
What are you doing here?

99
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:47,128
I came to help Young Lady Jin run away
from home due to her relationship.

100
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,714
But it looks like I just should leave.

101
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,424
I will be off now.

102
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,769
Why was Mu-deok here?

103
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:06,188
I was sure she did not recognize me.

104
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,108
Should I have just killed her?

105
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,779
Bu-yeon, I left your room untouched.

106
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,783
After all, I knew that
this day would come.

107
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,338
Let us go inside.

108
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,857
All your belongings

109
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,443
are still here.

110
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:56,072
After I almost died
when I was washed up in the lake,

111
00:10:57,531 --> 00:11:01,369
I always had to wander,
unable to find a proper place to stay.

112
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,829
But now, I have my own room.

113
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,211
I had no idea I had a mother
waiting for me to return.

114
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:17,176
Every day was full of misery and distress.

115
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,808
My poor daughter.

116
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,603
I will make sure
you are always happy from now on.

117
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,439
Do not worry.

118
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,486
Mother.

119
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:56,173
Did Jin Mu really bring home
Lady Jin's daughter?

120
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:01,512
Yes, the girl he brought
opened the doors of Jinyowon.

121
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,473
- What?
- She opened the doors?

122
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,935
It takes more than a mere trick
to open those doors.

123
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:11,439
They can only be opened
by the members of the Jin family.

124
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:19,113
Does this really mean
Jin Bu-yeon has returned?

125
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:32,334
Why do my eyes hurt like crazy
every time I go to Jinyowon?

126
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,510
Is it because of
the power of their relics?

127
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,740
Mu-deok, what are you doing here?

128
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,659
Why were you looking in the mirror?

129
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,165
Did you want to look nice for me?

130
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,792
Do not be ridiculous.

131
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,586
Wait.

132
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,463
I want to make myself look nice.

133
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:21,050
How about you pick something suitable
for your young master?

134
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,304
I will pick one myself.

135
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:31,810
What do you think? Does it suit me?

136
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,855
Yes, sure. You look fabulous.

137
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:37,525
Of course it would look nice on me.

138
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,777
Let me see.

139
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,531
This looks nice on me too.

140
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,491
This is just too hard.
Everything suits me.

141
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,373
What is this?

142
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:55,918
Give me that. I will doll you up.

143
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:05,094
Look at you. You look stunning.

144
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:07,972
It looks like I am all dolled up now.

145
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,557
Now, it is your turn.

146
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,064
Look at how pretty you look, Mu-deok.

147
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:22,194
How childish of you.
I thought you only liked my eyes.

148
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,947
I know, right?
I only thought your eyes were pretty.

149
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:28,909
But your poison must have done
a number on me.

150
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,828
Now, you look pretty no matter what.

151
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:44,466
I see you are trying hard not to love me.

152
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,551
You seem distressed.

153
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,349
Not at all. You could not be more wrong.

154
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:59,440
If you are going to lie to my face,
at least try not to show it.

155
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:02,109
You are blushing right now.

156
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,823
That is because
you put all this blush on my face.

157
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,033
Let me see.

158
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:14,163
I must have applied too much.
It will not come off.

159
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,751
You kind of

160
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:22,129
look like a drunk dog right now.

161
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:28,802
You should not glare like that.
You look like a dog about to bite.

162
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:31,221
I might as well just bite you.

163
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,643
I will not bite. Come here.

164
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:41,690
All right. Stop.

165
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,279
I had to buy this because of you.

166
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:51,659
Do not use it if you do not need it.
I will use it for myself.

167
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,995
This is pretty too.

168
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,099
Mu-deok…

169
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,702
You were almost hit by the wagon.

170
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,546
Mu-deok.

171
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:30,674
Are you really drunk or something?
Did you drink without me?

172
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:36,263
I had a drink too.
How about we have some more together?

173
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,599
I am not drunk.

174
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:40,976
Were you out drinking?

175
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,854
I went to Gaema Village
and someone let me have a drink.

176
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,815
Did you meet Shaman Choi there?

177
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,778
I found a connection
between her and Jin Mu.

178
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:53,697
But I also ran into
the Crown Prince there.

179
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:55,532
The Crown Prince?

180
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:59,036
His Royal Highness is also suspicious
of Jin Mu and the Queen.

181
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:07,878
Your Royal Highness.

182
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,090
Are you coming back from Gaema Village?

183
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,174
Yes.

184
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:16,512
The place was like a maze.
It was hard to find my way out.

185
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,222
What is it?

186
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,683
- Is there something the matter?
- The Assistant Gwanju is here.

187
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:46,542
Where did you go all by yourself
without a single person to escort you?

188
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:50,420
It is embarrassing enough to be caught
after sneaking out. Please let it slide.

189
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,842
I just met His Majesty.

190
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,511
He brought up the King's Star again.

191
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:00,848
He seems to want it so much.

192
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:04,560
You should just give him a fake
constellation plate with the King's Star.

193
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,979
Then he must find everyone
who was born that day

194
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:08,564
and kill them.

195
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,483
Why?

196
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,902
It could be a hero like Master Seo Gyeong

197
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,905
instead of being a traitor
wishing to conspire against the king.

198
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,491
They say Seo Gyeong saved the world
with the ice stone.

199
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:20,575
But that is not true.

200
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,830
In truth, he controlled the world
by forbidding everyone

201
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:26,456
from using that immense power.

202
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:30,252
The ice stone enables sorcery,
which is why it is dangerous.

203
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,504
That is the logic set by Songrim.

204
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,884
The ice stone has the power
to bring eternity to finite things.

205
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,595
Instead of aging and dying,

206
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:43,348
its power could enable us
to stay young and beautiful.

207
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,142
Are you talking about
the alchemy of souls?

208
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:47,144
The sorcery that was banned by Songrim.

209
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:48,770
But what if the ban gets lifted

210
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,774
and the use of the ice stone
becomes permissible?

211
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:51,940
Your Royal Highness.

212
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,443
What do you think would happen then?

213
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:01,325
Those who possess the ice stone
will be able to live forever.

214
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,662
But it would be dangerous if that kind
of power can be used by anyone.

215
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,623
Not everyone will be able to use it.

216
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:10,459
We will create a new order
where only those specially chosen,

217
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:13,062
like you, Your Royal Highness,
will be allowed to use its power.

218
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,467
We need to find the ice stone

219
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,178
in order for that to become possible.

220
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:24,640
Jin Bu-yeon, the long-lost daughter
of Jinyowon, has returned.

221
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,725
- Jinyowon?
- The woman who helped

222
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:31,021
Master Seo Gyeong find the ice stone
was the first leader of Jinyowon.

223
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:33,315
And Jin Bu-yeon has divine powers

224
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,192
that parallel that of the first leader.

225
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,950
If the ice stone appears
just like it did 200 years ago,

226
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,868
the priestess of Jinyowon

227
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,121
will surely find it once again.

228
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,378
The eldest daughter of Jinyowon
has returned alive.

229
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:57,756
She seemed like an ordinary blind girl.

230
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,259
I thought she was a powerful priestess.

231
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,511
I wonder if she lost her power.

232
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:03,971
I guess it is possible

233
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:07,057
seeing that she failed
to find her way home for ten years.

234
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:13,563
She was brought here by Jin Mu.
There is no way she is ordinary.

235
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,232
Did you notice anything peculiar?

236
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:21,363
I ran into her once
in front of your house.

237
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:26,118
I remember because I picked up
the cane she had dropped.

238
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:29,746
She was in front of my house?

239
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,082
But nothing about her
seemed peculiar that day.

240
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:33,792
The same goes for today.

241
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:38,587
The umbrella…

242
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:44,261
She was carrying an umbrella.

243
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:46,263
I have seen that umbrella somewhere.

244
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:49,725
An umbrella?
What is so special about an umbrella?

245
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:50,851
No.

246
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:53,729
That umbrella was made
with high-quality sheepskin and bamboo.

247
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,023
It was very expensive.

248
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:59,484
- How did it end up with her?
- Why?

249
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,153
Who did it originally belong to?

250
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:04,448
The umbrella?

251
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,825
I do not have that umbrella anymore.

252
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,869
I gave it to someone.

253
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:10,287
Who did you give it to and where?

254
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,789
It was not intentional.

255
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,708
I am sorry. I know you bought it for me.

256
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,918
You do not need to apologize.

257
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,338
Did you give it to a woman?

258
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:21,965
Yes, I did give it to a woman.

259
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,050
Please do not be angry.

260
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,054
Why would I be angry?

261
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,555
Who was that woman?

262
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:30,140
Tell me.

263
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:32,684
Will you answer me already?
This is so frustrating.

264
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,603
Who was the woman you gave it to?

265
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:39,649
Mu-deok.

266
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:42,152
That is not the way to ask. Yul is…

267
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,739
He is pale with fear.

268
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:48,116
You sound like a wife
interrogating a cheating husband.

269
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,869
It is inappropriate to ask him
with such a demanding tone.

270
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,538
Watch and learn. Yul.

271
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:56,500
Did you give that umbrella
to a blind girl?

272
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,251
How did you know that?

273
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:02,506
By any chance, is she So-i,
the girl you mentioned last time?

274
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,967
Yes, I gave it to her.

275
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,177
Why do you ask?

276
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,471
Today, I went to Jinyowon

277
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:12,474
and saw their long-lost daughter,
Jin Bu-yeon.

278
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,142
She was blind,

279
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,478
but she was holding an umbrella
instead of a cane.

280
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:18,563
Was it the same umbrella?

281
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,109
Hey.

282
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,862
Hey, did you hear?

283
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:29,241
They found Young Lady Jin's older sister.
They found Jin Bu-yeon.

284
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:32,077
Do you hear me?

285
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,538
What is with this atmosphere?

286
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,581
What were you talking about?

287
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,209
We were talking about So-i,
the girl we were looking for.

288
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:40,835
So-i?

289
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:42,921
Oh, the swindler?

290
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:44,505
Did you find her?

291
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,842
The Jin Bu-yeon that Jin Mu has brought in

292
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:48,927
is So-i, the swindler.

293
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,596
She must have killed all those people

294
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,598
to keep her identity a secret.

295
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:10,532
Jin Bu-yeon.

296
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:16,955
I will make sure to become
indistinguishable from you.

297
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,933
This is exactly the same
as the one that Mu-deok had.

298
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:41,771
Why is this here?

299
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:44,816
Bu-yeon.

300
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,159
Do you remember

301
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:56,328
this eye mask?

302
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:05,587
The eye masks you wore

303
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,924
were all embroidered by me.

304
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,843
I was always worried that

305
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,888
something might happen to you
since you could not see.

306
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:19,309
So I always made you wear an eye mask
that had the crest of Jinyowon on it.

307
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,104
I see.

308
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,694
This may be old,
but it is made out of silk.

309
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:33,073
Your biological parents might be rich.

310
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:37,577
Are you sure you are blind?

311
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:40,497
I cannot find spring water
even though I can see,

312
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,707
but you have no trouble at all.

313
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:50,006
Bu-yeon, you always had
the ability to sense energy.

314
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:54,803
You could find things a lot better
than those who could see,

315
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:58,223
and you easily found your way
around places.

316
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,935
That is exactly how Mu-deok was
in Sari Village.

317
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:04,980
She found things easily
and always knew where she was going.

318
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,898
You were wearing the same eye mask

319
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:11,361
the very day you disappeared.

320
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:15,991
So I hoped that you might use the eye mask

321
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:18,702
to find your way back home.

322
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:22,163
She always cherished it

323
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,708
saying it was the only way
to find her parents.

324
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:28,253
If you had kept that with you,

325
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:32,716
I would have recognized you at once.

326
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,262
The eye mask that I stole from Mu-deok
was made by this woman.

327
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:39,973
In any case,

328
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:43,852
thank you so much
for coming back alive, Bu-yeon.

329
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:53,320
The real Jin Bu-yeon,
the daughter of this woman,

330
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:56,156
is Mu-deok.

331
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,430
My goodness, Bu-yeon!

332
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:26,853
I wonder if Mu-deok was the reason
why these doors opened that day.

333
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,482
Mu-deok is the real daughter.

334
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:34,486
What will become of me
if she finds that out?

335
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:38,782
Will I die?

336
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:45,997
Bu-yeon.

337
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:48,708
What are you doing here?

338
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,853
Are you trying to open the doors again?

339
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,045
No.

340
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:58,385
I just cannot believe that
I am the daughter of this family.

341
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:01,137
Do not worry.

342
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:02,972
You can believe it.

343
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:05,975
We all saw you open those doors.

344
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:13,650
By the way, about the girl
who was here with you last night…

345
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:14,859
Mu-deok?

346
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,070
She is not a person of Jinyowon.

347
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:20,407
Does she come here often?
Mother seemed to know her too.

348
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,200
Mother does not like her.

349
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:24,369
She once caused trouble, you see.

350
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:25,745
Is that so?

351
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,374
So that is why.

352
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:31,459
I sensed bad energy from her.

353
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:34,963
Bad energy?

354
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:38,967
The energy I sensed from that girl
was dark and unpleasant.

355
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:42,846
You should not stay close to someone
with that kind of energy.

356
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:46,558
She is not that bad of a person.

357
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:48,977
There you girls are.

358
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,147
Father.

359
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,230
Father.

360
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,692
Cho-yeon, your mother is looking for you.

361
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:57,360
Mother?

362
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:00,864
I thought she was no longer angry.

363
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,743
- I should go then.
- Go on.

364
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,292
I warned you to keep a distance
from my daughter.

365
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:14,169
I apologize.

366
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:17,589
We must go to Cheonbugwan
on the last day of this month.

367
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:19,674
- So be prepared.
- Yes.

368
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:22,343
Father, wait.

369
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,139
My lord.

370
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:31,227
Are you sure Jin Bu-yeon is dead?

371
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:35,106
What will happen to me
if she were to return?

372
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:38,318
You do not need to worry
about such a thing.

373
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:41,905
She is dead.

374
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,458
Even if Mu-deok is their real daughter,

375
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:55,210
no one in their family knows that.

376
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:58,296
I just need to make sure no one finds out.

377
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:03,134
I am Jin Bu-yeon.

378
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,898
I thought about it all night.

379
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:19,818
Although this may put my love at risk,

380
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:23,404
I will do what I must
as the heir of Songrim.

381
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,032
- I should tell my uncle.
- No.

382
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:29,410
You all remember seeing him
arguing with Lady Jin, right?

383
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,287
If we accuse her daughter

384
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,998
of being a fake and a murderer
without any concrete evidence,

385
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,751
things could get ugly
between Songrim and Jinyowon.

386
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:39,087
You have a point.

387
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:43,091
If the truth gets revealed, there will be
a fight between Jin Mu and Jinyowon.

388
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:46,261
Songrim should not get involved
if we are not sure.

389
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:50,807
But why did they bring a swindler

390
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,600
to act as such a powerful priestess?

391
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,769
Because they need someone
in that position.

392
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:56,813
What if she gets caught?

393
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:58,898
A mother would know her daughter.

394
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:02,402
In the end, she will get caught.
Why do something so reckless?

395
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:04,946
Because it does not matter.

396
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,783
Jin Mu must have something big

397
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,661
so that even if Jin Ho-gyeong finds out
her daughter is a fake,

398
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,914
she will not be able
to do anything about it.

399
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:24,257
Something about her is different.

400
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:29,804
She has the same scar and mole
that Bu-yeon had as a child.

401
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,765
But her ears are different.

402
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:36,978
The shape of our ears never changes.

403
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,482
Am I not remembering things correctly?

404
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,819
Ho-gyeong.

405
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,589
I am surprised you only wish to see

406
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:08,259
the inside of Jinyowon
in return for helping me find Bu-yeon.

407
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,721
This place was forbidden to me

408
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:13,973
although I was a member of the Jin family.

409
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:16,309
I do remember severely punishing you

410
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:18,895
every time you came close to Jinyowon.

411
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:22,523
I admit I have been too harsh on you.

412
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,944
I hated you for you were the result
of my father's affair,

413
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:28,404
and I despised you
for always trying so hard

414
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,406
to please and butter everyone up.

415
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:32,492
I am sorry.

416
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,039
It is all in the past.

417
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,892
Now that Bu-yeon is back,

418
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,982
you should quickly choose your successor.

419
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:09,529
Are you telling me to appoint her
as the next leader of Jinyowon?

420
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:14,534
Appointing a new owner
will bring back life to Jinyowon.

421
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:15,743
Once that is done,

422
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:19,831
I will lay the groundwork for Cho-yeon
to become the Crown Princess.

423
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:25,420
There is no need to rush.

424
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,714
Bu-yeon has not
fully recovered her memory,

425
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,883
and I am still capable
to stay as the leader.

426
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:35,513
Your power is not enough for us
to retrieve the ice stone.

427
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:39,892
When you were pregnant with Bu-yeon,

428
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:42,895
you unsealed the ice stone from Jinyowon
and gave it to Jang Gang

429
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:44,856
in order to save her.

430
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:49,652
How do you know that?

431
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:50,945
Do not be startled.

432
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,281
I am not trying to accuse you
of your wrongdoings.

433
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:57,702
I bet Jang Gang insisted on
sealing the ice stone somewhere else

434
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:59,328
and did not return it to you.

435
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:02,874
Do you know
where Jang Gang hid the ice stone

436
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:04,625
that he took from Jinyowon?

437
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,419
Now that the successor
of Jinyowon is back,

438
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:10,631
I will return the ice stone
back to where it belongs.

439
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:14,177
Jin Mu, are you saying…

440
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,178
Ho-gyeong.

441
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:17,096
I just told you that I would return it.

442
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:19,807
Do not be suspicious
or stand on your guard.

443
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,602
Think of it as a gift that came
with your daughter's return.

444
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:26,314
All you need to do is
just accept it with joy.

445
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:48,211
It sounds like you are telling me

446
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:52,799
to blindly acknowledge Bu-yeon
if I wish to receive that gift.

447
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:56,344
Get rid of your suspicions and doubts,
and you will be able to have it all.

448
00:34:57,428 --> 00:35:00,848
Both the ice stone
and your long-lost daughter.

449
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:04,185
What do you want?

450
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:10,733
You must fight Songrim

451
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,486
in order to protect the ice stone.

452
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,573
You want me to fight with Songrim?

453
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,283
The collapse of Songrim

454
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:23,871
will allow us to possess
absolute power over the ice stone.

455
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,557
Are you talking about
the alchemy of souls?

456
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,725
The sorcery that was banned by Songrim.

457
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:47,436
But what if the ban gets lifted

458
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,522
and the use of the ice stone
becomes permissible?

459
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:50,731
Your Royal Highness.

460
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,317
What do you think would happen then?

461
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:58,030
An eternal life?

462
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:07,165
Has the petrification stopped?

463
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:09,709
He is able to breathe now.

464
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,712
He can also move his fingers and toes.

465
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:16,048
Master Kang was a mage
with many years of training.

466
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,051
How did he become tempted to use sorcery?

467
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:22,305
If Jin Mu were to approach me
and tell me I could shift my soul

468
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:25,224
into a younger and more beautiful body,
I would be tempted too.

469
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:31,314
I am joking. But I am sure
many people will fall for that.

470
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:32,899
They are merely keeping quiet

471
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:34,525
because of Songrim.

472
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:39,405
First, it was Cheonbugwan
and the royal palace.

473
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:43,784
Now it looks like Jin Mu
even has influence over Jinyowon.

474
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:44,994
But we have evidence

475
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:48,414
to prove that he has been
performing the alchemy of souls.

476
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:50,791
Once Master Kang spills everything,

477
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,127
we can finally put a stop to Jin Mu.

478
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,713
He is not scared that he got caught.

479
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:58,389
Instead, he is already
plotting something new.

480
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:01,928
I have no way of telling

481
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:05,056
how far Jin Mu is willing to go from here.

482
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:07,975
And that scares me.

483
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:19,195
What is the purpose of my visit
to Cheonbugwan this time?

484
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:22,323
Will I have to endure the pain
of another worm entering my body?

485
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,408
Just do as you are told.

486
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:29,622
There will be many others there,
so be careful of how you behave.

487
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:59,110
Today, I shall finally reveal

488
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:02,530
the Danju of our secret organization.

489
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:10,997
Stand before everyone here
and show your face.

490
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:32,310
The Danju is not only
the most powerful priestess of Daeho,

491
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:35,479
but also the future leader of Jinyowon.
Her name is Jin Bu-yeon.

492
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:40,401
Show your respect to the Danju.

493
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:58,753
I will use her to bring the ice stone
out into the world.

494
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:01,922
Then I shall shift my soul into her body.

495
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:05,718
That will allow me to serve you
from a closer distance,

496
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:08,054
my sister.

497
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:26,572
The leader of Jinyowon gathered
a Unanimous Assembly

498
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:28,657
- without discussing it with Songrim?
- Yes.

499
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:31,952
She sent letters to all the families.
They are now heading to Songrim.

500
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:36,665
What in the world

501
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:40,544
is Jinyowon trying to do this time?

502
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:50,179
She is the mother of the young man
who is currently lying in Sejukwon.

503
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,226
Why is everyone gathering here?

504
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:59,480
Jinyowon gathered the Unanimous Assembly.

505
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:04,527
Young Lady Cho-yeon is here.

506
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:07,905
Is that blind girl Jin Bu-yeon?

507
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:10,031
So-i?

508
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:12,283
Yes.

509
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,259
Things are proceeding
faster than expected.

510
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:19,834
They are going to use the fake daughter

511
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,794
to get something done today.

512
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,346
She must be Jin Bu-yeon.

513
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,960
The leader of Jinyowon has invited

514
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:06,338
the royal family and Cheonbugwan
to the Unanimous Assembly.

515
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:08,048
The Unanimous Assembly?

516
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,010
What for?

517
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:13,012
To announce a grave matter

518
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:16,056
that will determine the fate of Daeho.

519
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:28,861
The capital has been suffering from chaos
due to many incidents

520
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:30,988
regarding soul shifters

521
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:32,698
ever since the appearance of Naksu.

522
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:37,328
Thus, Jinyowon has
generously tried to help Songrim

523
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:39,246
find the source of sorcery.

524
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:41,372
However,

525
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:45,669
Songrim took our cooperation for granted

526
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:51,634
and arrogantly began to make
unreasonable demands and requests.

527
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:57,097
They barged into Jinyowon
as well as Cheonbugwan

528
00:41:57,181 --> 00:42:00,392
with the excuse of patrolling for sorcery.

529
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:03,896
They also tried to use
the relics of Jinyowon

530
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:05,814
to investigate all the families of mages

531
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:08,692
as if they thought everyone
outside of Songrim performed sorcery.

532
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:11,737
- Unbelievable.
- Worse than that,

533
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:15,741
they even took one of our relics
into the royal palace.

534
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:18,244
Did Songrim really cast doubt on us?

535
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:19,662
That is crossing the line.

536
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:25,376
Lady Jin, did you gather

537
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:28,587
the Unanimous Assembly to vent
and complain about Songrim?

538
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:29,671
Look at him.

539
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:32,007
I have only just started speaking,

540
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:33,968
and he is already trying to shut me up.

541
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,595
I, Jin Ho-gyeong, the leader of Jinyowon,

542
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:41,433
wish to stop Songrim's arbitrary actions
they justify as patrolling for sorcery.

543
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:44,144
That requires me to break
the 200-year-old rule

544
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:49,191
that has been kept until now,
which is why I have gathered you all.

545
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:53,945
Bu-yeon.

546
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:08,627
She is Jin Bu-yeon,
the long-lost successor of Jinyowon

547
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,087
who has returned after ten years.

548
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:14,925
I heard she found her daughter.

549
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:16,509
That must be her.

550
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:23,183
I have something to show you
with the help of my daughter,

551
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:25,853
who is also the successor of Jinyowon.

552
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:42,536
Songrim has been going around
in search of the ice stone,

553
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,538
the source of the alchemy of souls.

554
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:47,333
However, that ice stone
has been inside Jinyowon all along.

555
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:37,132
So that was Jin Mu's plan.

556
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:40,969
He wanted to use Jinyowon
to bring the ice stone into this world.

557
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:42,554
That cannot be all.

558
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:46,934
The person who got caught
will try to shift souls.

559
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:51,021
What do you mean?

560
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:52,648
Do you not get it?

561
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:55,943
The Queen had the ice stone,
but now it is with Jinyowon.

562
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,903
That means the shaman's soul will shift

563
00:44:58,987 --> 00:45:01,156
from the Queen's body
to someone at Jinyowon.

564
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:05,828
She will abandon the Queen's body

565
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:11,375
and shift her soul into the body
of the future leader of Jinyowon…

566
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:14,128
using the alchemy of souls.

567
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:28,851
That one in the front looks nice.

568
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,978
I heard the Unanimous Assembly

569
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:33,522
has gathered at Songrim
to talk about soul shifters.

570
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:35,315
Yes, apparently.

571
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:39,278
Do not buy unnecessary accessories.
Buy gold instead.

572
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:41,864
Gold is the only thing you can trust
in times of chaos.

573
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:44,783
Things will get busy
once the gathering is over.

574
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:45,701
Yes.

575
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:48,203
Once it is over,
they will all come to drink

576
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:50,956
- and talk dirt about Songrim.
- Hey.

577
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:53,584
Will you stop touching that
and just buy it already?

578
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:56,170
Goodness, give her some time.

579
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:57,713
I want to buy everything.

580
00:45:57,796 --> 00:45:59,798
- Let me try that.
- This one?

581
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:07,055
Everyone in the capital is
talking about the Unanimous Assembly

582
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:08,932
and the attendance of the royal family.

583
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:13,145
He will have to show himself
with all the fuss going around.

584
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,356
Are you talking about Master Jang?

585
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:21,862
I found it strange that
Young Master Park kept asking me

586
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:23,655
about Master Jang.

587
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:27,284
The leader of Songrim also seemed
to be waiting for him to show up.

588
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,543
Keep this with you

589
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,420
and give it to him once he comes.

590
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:40,464
What is it?

591
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:42,424
Can I see what it is?

592
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,770
It is an empty piece of paper.

593
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:58,649
Did you use a spell to write a letter
just like Words of the Heart?

594
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:04,238
Once Jang Gang reads that,
he will do what is written.

595
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:15,040
By the way, do you not need
to attend the Unanimous Assembly?

596
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:17,709
I am a pupil of Master Seo Gyeong.

597
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:20,796
If I go there,

598
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:25,842
I will neither be able to admit nor deny
the actions of my master.

599
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:36,144
Does this mean Master Seo Gyeong
left an ice stone unharmed?

600
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:38,605
I thought he destroyed all of them.

601
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:40,399
Was Songrim aware of this?

602
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:42,734
If so, everything that
Songrim has done until now

603
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:45,779
under the pretext of Master Seo Gyeong
would be considered fraud.

604
00:47:45,862 --> 00:47:48,365
- Do not speak nonsense.
- Fraud is what it is.

605
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:50,409
Songrim has enforced countless regulations

606
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:53,054
on all the families of mages
under the guise of patrolling for sorcery.

607
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:54,288
Do you not agree?

608
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:56,623
- I agree.
- You are right.

609
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:58,625
Did Songrim deceive us?

610
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,043
Have we been fooled?

611
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:02,504
- Is that what it is?
- Everyone, calm down.

612
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:05,257
The mages of Songrim

613
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:09,219
were not aware that
the ice stone was still inside Jinyowon.

614
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:11,972
We do not wish to hear your excuses.

615
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:13,390
We must discuss

616
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:17,311
what is to be done about the ice stone
that Master Seo Gyeong left behind.

617
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:20,439
We must destroy the ice stone
as it is the source of sorcery.

618
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:22,859
That is what Master Seo Gyeong
would have wanted.

619
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:25,068
We must destroy the ice stone

620
00:48:25,902 --> 00:48:28,071
in front of everyone here as witnesses.

621
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:31,408
He was the one
who left the ice stone inside Jinyowon.

622
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:34,328
Following his command
would be to leave it inside Jinyowon.

623
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:37,706
Then you never should have
brought it outside in the first place.

624
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:41,293
How could you expect Songrim to stay still
after having revealed its existence?

625
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:44,171
Are you trying to make a fool of Songrim?

626
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:47,049
The leader of Jinyowon has a point.

627
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:48,592
She merely wishes to respect

628
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:50,778
Master Seo Gyeong's intentions
by leaving it inside Jinyowon.

629
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:55,515
Songrim no longer has a say
in what to do with the ice stone.

630
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:59,353
Unbelievable. Do you not even care
what Songrim thinks anymore?

631
00:48:59,936 --> 00:49:01,581
The purpose of this gathering
is to discuss

632
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:04,441
how to use the ice stone
based on Master Seo Gyeong's wishes.

633
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:06,902
If Songrim has a problem with that,
you may leave.

634
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:08,528
- Here, here.
- Agreed.

635
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:10,947
Songrim has deceived us,
so stay out of this.

636
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:13,700
- Yes, you have no say.
- Stay out of it.

637
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:14,993
Leave if you have a problem.

638
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:17,454
- Just leave!
- Get out!

639
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:18,914
So this is why Jin Mu

640
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:22,250
revealed the ice stone to the world.

641
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:25,253
Now that Songrim's logic
no longer seems valid,

642
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:27,714
no one is willing to listen to them.

643
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:36,098
What are you doing there?

644
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:37,933
If Songrim is against

645
00:49:38,016 --> 00:49:40,644
keeping the ice stone inside Jinyowon,

646
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:44,231
then how about
letting a third party keep it?

647
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:46,566
So here is my proposal.

648
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,568
How about keeping it at Gisan?

649
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,987
- Where did that idea come from?
- Gisan?

650
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:52,948
Why should it be kept at Gisan?

651
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:54,700
You and your family are low-level mages.

652
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:55,783
What did you say?

653
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:58,620
Your family has no right
to keep the ice stone.

654
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:00,622
- We will not allow it.
- We have no right?

655
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:04,418
My family has been around the longest
in the history of Daeho.

656
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:06,753
So we have every right
to protect the ice stone.

657
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:08,922
How dare you try to touch it!

658
00:50:09,005 --> 00:50:11,633
- Are you trying to start a fight?
- Speak for yourself!

659
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:14,177
- What do you think you are doing?
- Watch your tongue.

660
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:16,763
Who do you think you are?

661
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,890
You little shrimp!

662
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:20,434
Did you call me a shrimp?

663
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:21,935
Hey, that is enough.

664
00:50:22,018 --> 00:50:23,018
Get out of the way!

665
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:29,109
Did you just hit me?

666
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:31,236
Damn you, old man!

667
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:34,406
You little…

668
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:36,950
Get off me, you punk!

669
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:42,080
Did you just gather energy?

670
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:44,416
Fine. Go ahead and attack me.

671
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:46,084
- Damn you.
- Go ahead.

672
00:50:46,668 --> 00:50:47,586
Do you…

673
00:50:47,669 --> 00:50:49,796
Do you think I will not be able to?

674
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,256
You are as impudent as you look.

675
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:53,341
Look who is talking.

676
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:56,428
My grandfather is
at the Unanimous Assembly?

677
00:50:56,511 --> 00:50:57,511
Yes.

678
00:50:57,929 --> 00:51:01,016
I could not find the medical manual
you requested at Jeongjingak.

679
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:03,935
I will go to Jeongjingak
and look for it myself.

680
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:07,314
The Unanimous Assembly must be a big deal.

681
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:10,275
All the mages at Sejukwon
must have gone there.

682
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:17,699
I was told that my son
is still alive here.

683
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:43,975
Ji-ho…

684
00:52:02,994 --> 00:52:04,329
You are alive.

685
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:14,089
Ji-ho.

686
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:43,159
Everyone, please settle down!

687
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:47,956
I think it is time

688
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:50,792
for Jin Ho-gyeong to get involved
and settle the issue.

689
00:53:00,176 --> 00:53:03,263
Everyone! That is enough!

690
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,184
- I will get back to you later!
- Fine by me!

691
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:09,811
Consider yourself lucky.

692
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:11,604
Allow me to speak.

693
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,608
Judging by everyone's opinions,

694
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:16,735
it seems best that we use the ice stone

695
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:20,780
left by Master Seo Gyeong
for the benefit of everyone here.

696
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:23,074
Therefore,

697
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:27,704
I, Jin Ho-gyeong, the leader of Jinyowon,
would like to make a suggestion.

698
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:31,166
How about giving the rights
to gather the Unanimous Assembly

699
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:35,754
to Jinyowon instead of Songrim
from now on?

700
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,511
If no one here is against the idea,

701
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:45,430
I shall end the gathering here.

702
00:53:45,513 --> 00:53:49,100
And as of this moment on,
Jinyowon will take Songrim's place

703
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:52,616
and take charge of holding the discussions
regarding the ice stone.

704
00:53:58,234 --> 00:53:59,736
I will take that as a yes

705
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:01,571
and end today's Unanimous Assembly.

706
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:06,826
As for the ice stone,
it will remain inside Jinyowon.

707
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:09,579
The right thing to do

708
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:14,542
is to destroy the ice stone
to prevent further quarrels.

709
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:17,087
What gives Songrim the right
to make that decision?

710
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:18,505
No one here agrees with it.

711
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:21,633
The alchemy of souls has been performed,
and that was possible

712
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:24,094
because of the Soul Ejector
created from that ice stone.

713
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:26,364
First, you cast doubt
on Cheonbugwan and the royal family.

714
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:28,723
And now, you are
doing the same to Jinyowon.

715
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:33,603
I will not allow
the Unanimous Assembly to end like this.

716
00:54:35,146 --> 00:54:36,314
Lady Jin.

717
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:42,404
I forbid you to take the ice stone
outside of Songrim.

718
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:45,615
Are you trying to go up against
everyone here?

719
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:47,075
No one is allowed

720
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:50,620
to take the ice stone outside of Songrim.

721
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:01,214
I order you to fight

722
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:04,843
and stop anyone who attempts to do so.

723
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:10,849
A war will break out at this rate.

724
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:20,859
The situation has turned unstable.

725
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:22,777
You should get involved, Your Majesty.

726
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:25,822
Master Lee was right.

727
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:28,616
Everyone coveted it,
which led to endless fights.

728
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:30,285
And that is why it was banned.

729
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:34,164
Everyone is fighting over the ice stone,

730
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:36,041
which means Master Lee

731
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:38,460
must also be right about the King's Star.

732
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:25,965
I can see that
all of my former masters are here.

733
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:29,594
Allow your former pupil, Jang Uk,
to greet all of you.

734
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:32,305
Who is that young man?

735
00:56:32,388 --> 00:56:33,640
He is Jang Uk.

736
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:36,518
The reckless son of the Jang family
who used to be my pupil.

737
00:56:37,393 --> 00:56:39,813
As I recall,
your family also tried to train him.

738
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:42,857
Yes, I remember he ran away
in just three days.

739
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:46,069
I apologize for interrupting
this passionate discussion

740
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:49,405
with the sound of the drum.

741
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:54,911
- What should I stop him?
- Let him talk.

742
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:58,540
Whatever the case,
he managed to stop the fight.

743
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:00,875
Jang Uk, son of Jang Gang.

744
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:06,047
You had better have a good reason
for interfering like this

745
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:08,383
in front of His Majesty the King.

746
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:15,014
I am here to tell you
what Master Seo Gyeong wanted.

747
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:28,653
I told him the true intentions
of Master Seo Gyeong.

748
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:30,488
I hope he uses it wisely.

749
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:40,206
I tell you this on behalf of Master Lee,
a pupil of Master Seo Gyeong.

750
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:42,584
So I expect everyone here
to show their respect

751
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:44,544
and listen to Master Seo Gyeong's will.

752
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:55,305
According to Master Lee,

753
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:57,849
Master Seo Gyeong's will
regarding the ice stone

754
00:57:57,932 --> 00:57:59,642
is written in Words of the Heart.

755
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:04,522
He wrote down the reason
he left behind the ice stone

756
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:07,192
and left it for all the mages
of Jeongjingak to read,

757
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:10,487
meaning Songrim did not hide anything.

758
00:58:13,615 --> 00:58:17,118
I believe most of you here
have also read Words of the Heart.

759
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:21,331
Our job is to find his intentions
in Words of the Heart.

760
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:25,835
Do you remember what it was about?

761
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:28,588
No, I read it too long ago.

762
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:30,340
Are you saying he wrote down

763
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:32,467
why he left the ice stone in that book?

764
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:35,345
Yes.

765
00:58:35,428 --> 00:58:39,015
I was told that everyone will follow
Master Seo Gyeong's wishes.

766
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:41,559
So what you should really be fighting over

767
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:43,895
is Words of the Heart, not the ice stone.

768
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:47,106
Where is the so-called Words of the Heart
that he is talking about?

769
00:58:47,815 --> 00:58:49,609
Songrim had been keeping it,

770
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:53,571
but we recently sent it to Jinyowon
on Master Lee's orders.

771
00:58:55,281 --> 00:58:57,867
It is being kept inside Jinyowon.

772
00:58:57,951 --> 00:59:00,078
Then bring the book here.

773
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:03,373
Yes, Your Majesty.

774
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:13,466
I am Jin Cho-yeon of Jinyowon.

775
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:16,135
I will bring Words of the Heart.

776
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:18,555
As it used to belong to Songrim,

777
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:20,807
I will send someone from Songrim as well.

778
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:24,102
Dang-gu, I want you to go with her.

779
00:59:30,024 --> 00:59:31,192
Let us go.

780
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:48,209
It has been decades

781
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:52,880
since I last read Words of the Heart.

782
00:59:52,964 --> 00:59:55,091
Can you remind me what it was about?

783
00:59:55,174 --> 00:59:57,385
It is just a short piece of poetry.

784
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:01,014
Then is Uk lying?

785
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:03,182
It does not say anything
about the ice stone.

786
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:08,021
I have no idea why he suddenly brought up
Words of the Heart.

787
01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:13,568
What is inside Words of the Heart?

788
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:15,028
I do not know.

789
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:19,907
He is probably just bluffing
to stall the situation.

790
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,744
But that book was written by Seo Gyeong.

791
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:26,164
We barely managed
to break everyone's trust in Songrim.

792
01:00:26,247 --> 01:00:28,583
What if that causes everyone
to trust Songrim again?

793
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:34,464
Young Master Jang,
they seem extremely angry.

794
01:00:34,547 --> 01:00:36,716
Soon, they will also be startled.

795
01:00:37,592 --> 01:00:38,801
But to do that,

796
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:41,054
I need his help.

797
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:56,027
This is nothing more than just poetry.

798
01:00:57,111 --> 01:00:58,988
Is there a meaning behind this?

799
01:01:00,406 --> 01:01:01,574
I am not sure.

800
01:01:02,617 --> 01:01:05,286
He must have used the book
to stop the fighting.

801
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:07,872
If he did it to stall for time,

802
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:10,166
I should take as much time as I can.

803
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:11,833
Let us hurry back.

804
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:13,628
No, wait.

805
01:01:13,711 --> 01:01:16,547
I am extremely starving.
Do you have anything to eat?

806
01:01:17,632 --> 01:01:19,342
I did not even have breakfast.

807
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:23,262
Are you purposely trying
to buy time for Songrim?

808
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:29,268
Do you want to return
and see everyone get into a dispute again?

809
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:31,396
We have no time to argue.

810
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:32,980
My mother and sister are waiting.

811
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:35,274
Young Lady Jin.

812
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:38,319
Do you really think

813
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:41,197
she is your real sister?

814
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:43,908
Why do you ask?

815
01:01:43,991 --> 01:01:49,288
You know that the real culprit behind
the murder that Mu-deok was accused of

816
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:51,082
was a girl named So-i, right?

817
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:55,461
The girl you believe to be your sister

818
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:58,131
is actually So-i.

819
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:01,592
What?

820
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:24,699
I heard you told Cho-yeon that
you feel uneasy about that girl.

821
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:28,536
Yes.

822
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:32,498
I feel uneasy because I sense bad energy.

823
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:35,376
I do not wish for her
to come near me ever again.

824
01:02:41,382 --> 01:02:43,801
I should always make sure
to keep you safe,

825
01:02:44,635 --> 01:02:45,928
so I will get rid of her.

826
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:53,770
Thank you, Mother.

827
01:03:21,547 --> 01:03:22,840
Her attitude has changed.

828
01:03:23,716 --> 01:03:25,384
Does she know that she is fake?

829
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:28,805
Is she using her, knowing she is fake?

830
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:33,810
Why did you use Words of the Heart
to stall for time?

831
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:40,817
DAILY LOG OF CHEONBUGWAN

832
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:45,196
"The fifth of May."

833
01:03:45,279 --> 01:03:47,448
"While Cheonbugwan's Gwanju, Jang Gang,

834
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:50,201
attempted to capture Shaman Choi
for cursing someone with sorcery,

835
01:03:50,284 --> 01:03:52,787
she ran away into a fire."

836
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:54,622
"She is presumed dead."

837
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:58,122
The story we heard
from Shaman Bong at Gaema Village

838
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:00,169
actually exists as a record.

839
01:04:00,753 --> 01:04:04,590
This is probably when Shaman Choi
and Jin Mu met.

840
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:07,802
Why are you so persistent
about finding this Shaman Choi?

841
01:04:07,885 --> 01:04:11,305
Did you find the house that
Eunuch Kim frequented at Gaema Village?

842
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:14,016
Yes, I did.

843
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:17,186
The place he frequented was an apothecary.

844
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:18,646
An apothecary?

845
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:21,858
I have told you one thing,
so it is your turn to tell me.

846
01:04:23,442 --> 01:04:24,610
Eunuch Kim

847
01:04:25,444 --> 01:04:27,864
referred to the person he served
as "Shaman Choi."

848
01:04:31,742 --> 01:04:33,661
The person that Eunuch Kim served was…

849
01:04:33,744 --> 01:04:35,496
It was Her Highness, the Queen.

850
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,167
I know you have also been
suspicious of her.

851
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:43,129
The soul of the actual Queen
is still alive.

852
01:04:43,963 --> 01:04:46,799
She is most likely at the place
that Eunuch Kim kept going to.

853
01:04:47,758 --> 01:04:49,594
How can you be sure that she is alive?

854
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:57,101
The Queen's Lantern of Life
is still glowing.

855
01:04:57,184 --> 01:04:59,020
She is a member of the Seo family.

856
01:04:59,687 --> 01:05:01,022
I will find the real Queen

857
01:05:01,105 --> 01:05:04,150
and reveal the true identity of the one
at the Unanimous Assembly.

858
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:11,532
So you want me to get involved in this?

859
01:05:11,616 --> 01:05:13,784
This is regarding your mother.

860
01:05:19,498 --> 01:05:20,791
What do you plan to do

861
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:23,002
with the ice stone
after you reveal everything?

862
01:05:23,085 --> 01:05:24,962
I will follow Master Seo Gyeong's wishes

863
01:05:25,046 --> 01:05:26,964
and do what is written
in Words of the Heart.

864
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:28,048
Uk.

865
01:05:28,883 --> 01:05:31,093
Words of the Heart
is not about the ice stone.

866
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:34,805
I thought you lied
to buy yourself some time.

867
01:05:34,889 --> 01:05:36,223
I did not lie.

868
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:38,601
The reason Master Seo Gyeong

869
01:05:38,684 --> 01:05:41,604
left the ice stone
is clearly written in Words of the Heart.

870
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:49,612
The ice stone holds the power of Hwansu.
Am I correct?

871
01:05:49,695 --> 01:05:52,323
It has the power
to control water, fire, and wind,

872
01:05:52,406 --> 01:05:55,326
as well as the power
to freely control the souls of humans.

873
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:57,370
That is why

874
01:05:57,453 --> 01:05:59,664
its power should be forbidden to mankind.

875
01:05:59,747 --> 01:06:03,042
It is hard to believe that
such a small piece of ice

876
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:04,293
holds such great power.

877
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:05,878
I must see it for myself.

878
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:12,760
Has anyone here witnessed its power
with their own two eyes?

879
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:19,433
Were you fighting over the ice stone
without even having witnessed its power?

880
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:24,146
Then how about we check

881
01:06:25,272 --> 01:06:27,566
how powerful it is
with everyone here as a witness?

882
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:30,403
How exactly do you suggest we do that?

883
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:31,696
If it controls souls,

884
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:35,074
then it should be able to bring back
a dead person to life.

885
01:06:36,575 --> 01:06:39,286
The power of Hwansu is not sorcery,
so it is not forbidden.

886
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:41,290
And bringing someone back to life
is a good deed.

887
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:44,472
Lady Jin, you brought the ice stone here,

888
01:06:45,626 --> 01:06:47,086
so you should show its power to us.

889
01:06:48,546 --> 01:06:49,880
Your Majesty.

890
01:06:49,964 --> 01:06:53,009
No one here is dead.
Who are we supposed to bring back to life?

891
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:56,095
Then kill someone.

892
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:03,018
Hey, you.

893
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:08,524
Come over here.

894
01:07:10,818 --> 01:07:11,818
Yes, Your Majesty.

895
01:07:17,074 --> 01:07:18,714
Kill her and then bring her back to life.

896
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:20,828
She is a maid who knows no spells.

897
01:07:21,412 --> 01:07:24,623
So you will not have to worry about her
getting close to the ice stone.

898
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:25,541
Your Majesty.

899
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:28,002
We cannot kill someone
for a mere experiment.

900
01:07:28,085 --> 01:07:29,962
What I want is
to see her come back to life

901
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:31,422
with this.

902
01:07:31,505 --> 01:07:33,549
How could you ask someone
so young and weak

903
01:07:33,632 --> 01:07:35,926
to do something so fearful?

904
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:40,639
Tell me.

905
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:43,017
Are you too scared?

906
01:07:46,562 --> 01:07:48,122
I will pay you 100 yangs worth of gold.

907
01:07:48,773 --> 01:07:50,107
What do you say?

908
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:54,570
Yes.

909
01:07:55,362 --> 01:07:56,530
I will try it.

910
01:07:57,948 --> 01:07:59,075
I will sacrifice myself

911
01:07:59,825 --> 01:08:03,370
to show the very power
that you and everyone here

912
01:08:04,455 --> 01:08:06,332
wish to witness.

913
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:37,154
This is finally my chance
to acquire the ice stone.

914
01:08:38,906 --> 01:08:43,410
In order to succeed in doing that,
I must die first.

915
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:49,125
No one here cares about
whether I live or die.

916
01:08:50,376 --> 01:08:52,962
They only desire to witness

917
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:55,422
the power of the ice stone.

918
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:17,987
I have no way of knowing
if I will just die

919
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:22,283
or retrieve my power
through the ice stone.

920
01:09:23,534 --> 01:09:25,619
I have pushed myself
to the edge of a cliff

921
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:29,623
with the ice stone in front of me.

922
01:09:29,707 --> 01:09:31,208
I also missed you.

923
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:35,504
That is my reply.

924
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:40,092
I am relieved that you did not
have to stand here beside me.

925
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:44,013
It was a desire to save the person
he cared about.

926
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:46,640
Master Seo Gyeong's Words of the Heart

927
01:09:46,724 --> 01:09:49,143
was a letter written to a dying lover.

928
01:09:49,226 --> 01:09:52,066
He wrote that he left something behind
in hopes to keep her by his side.

929
01:09:52,146 --> 01:09:53,898
Are you saying the great hero

930
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:57,234
who destroyed the ice stone
to save the world

931
01:09:57,318 --> 01:10:00,529
was tempted to use it
just to save someone's life?

932
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:02,698
It shows the foolishness
and heartache of a man

933
01:10:03,365 --> 01:10:06,085
who was willing to go against
the laws of nature to save a loved one.

934
01:10:06,827 --> 01:10:11,832
That is Master Seo Gyeong's confession
in Words of the Heart.

935
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:19,465
I am not happy
about this situation either.

936
01:10:21,258 --> 01:10:23,636
I will make sure you die a painless death.

937
01:10:25,346 --> 01:10:27,681
This is not to see me die.

938
01:10:28,974 --> 01:10:31,018
It is to see me come back to life.

939
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:36,065
Bring me back to life

940
01:10:37,107 --> 01:10:38,692
so no one here is disappointed.

941
01:10:40,736 --> 01:10:42,446
Then let us not disappoint anyone.

942
01:10:46,116 --> 01:10:48,244
A mother will be killing her own daughter.

943
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:45,551
You look beautiful.

944
01:11:47,052 --> 01:11:48,846
My Bu-yeon.

945
01:11:57,688 --> 01:11:58,814
Mother.

946
01:12:58,332 --> 01:12:59,792
Something has gone awry.

947
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:01,436
Could something have
happened to the ice stone?

948
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:04,838
The moment we reached the gate,
a strong gust of wind hit us.

949
01:13:04,922 --> 01:13:06,722
It definitely all happened
because of Mu-deok.

950
01:13:07,508 --> 01:13:09,134
The kids are in there!

951
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:10,260
Yun-ok!

952
01:13:10,344 --> 01:13:12,513
My energy just drained from the sword.

953
01:13:12,596 --> 01:13:14,723
I think the barrier
is causing the problem.

954
01:13:14,807 --> 01:13:16,683
The soul shifter, Master Kang,
has disappeared?

955
01:13:17,851 --> 01:13:21,522
None of us could use spells in here.
So why can he?

956
01:13:21,605 --> 01:13:23,357
We cannot all die.

957
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:25,442
I will lure and trap him
