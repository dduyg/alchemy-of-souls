00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:44,961
ALCHEMY OF SOULS
PART 2

2
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:13,239
If something happens to Yul,

3
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:15,784
Uk will see red.

4
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:18,745
He has been suppressing his anger
for a very long time.

5
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:20,412
But…

6
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:22,707
if the men from Cheonbugwan harm Yul,

7
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,542
Uk will explode.

8
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:26,002
I hope nothing happens...

9
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,147
I know where the gambling den is.
Let me take you there.

10
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,316
I also know where the gambling den
in Gaema Village is.

11
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,884
Something might have happened there,
so please stay here.

12
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,820
Yul.

13
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:55,532
Yul.

14
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,493
Uk.

15
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:02,580
I am sorry.

16
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:31,276
Not a single person…

17
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:34,003
will be able to walk out of here alive.

18
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,339
What is this blood parasite?

19
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:56,174
It is a creature

20
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:59,012
that you put in someone's bloodstream.

21
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,431
We put it in So-i's bloodstream,

22
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:05,602
but I do not know why Seo Yul has it.

23
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,562
Who put that thing in So-i's body?

24
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,649
- Was it Jin Mu's doing?
- Yes.

25
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:42,804
Yul.

26
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,683
Yul.

27
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:55,860
Seo Yul was attacked
by mages of Cheonbugwan?

28
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:56,861
What do you mean?

29
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,363
I just heard from Songrim.

30
00:03:58,446 --> 00:03:59,572
Everyone is panicking.

31
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,032
They must be mistaken.

32
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:03,493
Why would Cheonbugwan mages
ever attack him?

33
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:04,786
My lord!

34
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,413
We have a problem.

35
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:10,142
Yeom-su and our mages were attacked
at the gambling den in Gaema Village.

36
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,166
What?

37
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,503
Why? Who attacked them?

38
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,464
It was Jang Uk.
He single-handedly subdued them all.

39
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,303
More than ten Cheonbugwan mages
attacked Seo Yul.

40
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,680
Had it not been for Jang Uk,

41
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,723
Yul would have died.

42
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,352
Did you say Yul was taken to Sejukwon?

43
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,980
How is he?

44
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:34,732
Seo Yul's health is in grave danger,
Your Majesty.

45
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,694
If Seo Yul dies,

46
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:41,197
it will start a great clash
between Songrim and Cheonbugwan.

47
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:50,540
The blood parasite
is inside his core of energy.

48
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,875
Then you should remove it.

49
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:57,380
There is no way to remove a blood parasite
that is inside a mage's core of energy.

50
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,508
It will only come out after he dies.

51
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:02,260
Using his energy

52
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:04,971
would have surged
the blood parasite's energy,

53
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:07,015
thus making it painful for him.

54
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,558
He fought in this state.

55
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:12,186
One can only imagine how much pain
he was in until the last moment.

56
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,731
What do you mean, last moment?

57
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:17,984
Are you telling me he will die?

58
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:19,609
Yul.

59
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,779
Please find a way.

60
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,408
We cannot let him die like this.

61
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:28,036
He must have suffered unbearable pain.

62
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,040
Yul.

63
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,722
Yul's Lantern of Life
is in Seoho Fortress.

64
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:49,098
SEO YUL

65
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:52,852
The light will die out if Yul passes away.

66
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:56,856
Then his father, General Seo,

67
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:59,192
will immediately come to the capital

68
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,528
to find out the cause of his abrupt death.

69
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,282
The Seo family obeyed
Master Seo Gyeong's commands

70
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:08,302
and has been protecting Seoho Fortress
along the borders.

71
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:11,454
If they come to the capital
and clash with Cheonbugwan,

72
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,998
a war could break out.

73
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,124
Seo Il

74
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,627
is your elder brother, is he not?

75
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,004
Please try to dissuade him.

76
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,216
He would never listen to his sister

77
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:26,469
who has the appearance of Shaman Choi
as a result of the alchemy of souls.

78
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,221
Instead,

79
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:32,092
you should worry
about how Songrim will react to this.

80
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,485
I have not seen Uk for a while now.

81
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:43,568
I believe

82
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:45,530
he has gone to Cheonbugwan.

83
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:49,283
I have no intentions of dissuading him.

84
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:52,245
They pushed the heir of the Seo family
to the brink of death.

85
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:55,123
Cheonbugwan should pay
for what they have done.

86
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:59,335
I will support Uk.

87
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:00,837
What will Songrim do?

88
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,464
Uncle.

89
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,633
I am not yet confident
to represent Songrim.

90
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,552
But given what happened to my friend,

91
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:09,595
I will support Uk as well.

92
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:11,973
Park Dang-gu.

93
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,936
As the leader of Songrim,
you should protect it.

94
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,855
Master Heo, please take care of Yul.

95
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:22,233
Gather the mages.

96
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:26,821
I will go to Cheonbugwan myself.

97
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:33,077
Seo Yul's death must never
be attributed to Cheonbugwan.

98
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:36,289
Summon the Unanimous Assembly right now.
We must plead our innocence.

99
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:37,290
- Yes.
- My lord.

100
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:39,208
- He is on his way.
- Who is?

101
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,711
Jang Uk is coming to Cheonbugwan
as we speak.

102
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:05,693
Jang Uk

103
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,654
is coming for me.

104
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,782
Gather all the mages of Cheonbugwan.

105
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,327
Stop Jang Uk from entering Cheonbugwan!

106
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,410
Yes, my lord.

107
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:25,338
Jang Uk is headed to Cheonbugwan.

108
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:27,465
Songrim is taking action as well.

109
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:29,967
Your Royal Highness, what shall we do?

110
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,203
Fire!

111
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,727
Stop! His Royal Highness is here.

112
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,827
- Stop it here, Jang Uk.
- Please move.

113
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,704
Will you keep fighting them?

114
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,289
I do not care.

115
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,372
I will

116
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,001
kill Jin Mu.

117
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,168
To do that,

118
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,338
you will have to kill
all of Cheonbugwan's mages

119
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,422
as well as

120
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,301
all of the royal soldiers.

121
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:56,387
If they get in my way to protect him,

122
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:58,848
then I have no other choice.

123
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,185
You are not an exception.

124
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,269
So…

125
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:07,523
keep hiding behind him,
like you always do.

126
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:13,237
I am not trying
to protect Jin Mu from you!

127
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:21,078
I do not want
all your hard work to come to no avail.

128
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,956
I know that the sword in your hands

129
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:27,168
reflects your grief, hatred, and rage.

130
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,218
Then you must also know

131
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,930
to whom these emotions are directed.

132
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,435
I know it is because of me.

133
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,597
That is the reason
I was uncomfortable with facing you.

134
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:53,611
To stop yourself
from wielding that sword at the world,

135
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:57,031
you painstakingly suppressed
and buried all those feelings inside.

136
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,663
I do not want your hard work
to go down the drain.

137
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,713
That is why I am standing before you

138
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:16,676
even though I know you can slay me.

139
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,889
He is about to attack
His Royal Highness! Fire!

140
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,099
Stop!

141
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,447
From now on, Songrim will support Jang Uk.

142
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,741
We will stand with his decisions

143
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:42,868
and fight alongside him.

144
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:44,912
So, Jang Uk,

145
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,039
deliberate carefully

146
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,168
where you point that sword.

147
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,522
If you point your sword towards me

148
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,775
and wield it against me,

149
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,904
then I will have to fight them as well.

150
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:22,408
I know that you neither like nor trust me.

151
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:23,534
However,

152
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,746
please do not fall short
of my expectations.

153
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,082
Then I will wait here.

154
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,253
Bring Jin Mu to me.

155
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,975
Cheonbugwan officials may have
harmed Seo Yul,

156
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:50,603
but they all died at Jang Uk's hand.

157
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:54,356
We could follow the mages' customs
and drop this issue.

158
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,608
So why

159
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,569
must I take responsibility for Seo Yul?

160
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:00,821
You must take responsibility
for the blood parasite.

161
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,867
The blood parasite?

162
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,119
His life is at risk

163
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,371
due to the blood parasite
in his core of energy.

164
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,208
Before he died,

165
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,251
Yeom-su confessed that it was your doing.

166
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,840
I only put that blood parasite
in an individual

167
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,134
to keep them under my control.

168
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,470
So I do not know how it ended up

169
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:26,514
in Seo Yul's body.

170
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:27,431
Nevertheless,

171
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,809
if Cheonbugwan officials tried to kill him
to keep it a secret,

172
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,741
you must take responsibility
as the Gwanju.

173
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,193
But why did the blood parasite…

174
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,654
Thankfully, Seo Yul is still alive.

175
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,281
If you find a way to save him,

176
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:47,368
they will not try to kill you.

177
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:48,536
I do not know.

178
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:52,039
Jin U-tak was the one who took
that blood parasite from Jinyowon.

179
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,583
I do not know how to control it,

180
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,127
let alone remove it
from his core of energy.

181
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,255
You must find a way.

182
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,381
If not,

183
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:05,010
Jang Uk will never back down.

184
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:27,116
Will you be staying here
until Jin Mu comes?

185
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,285
I am waiting
so as to act with deliberation.

186
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:33,539
Then my target will appear before me.

187
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:37,167
Is Jin Mu not your target?

188
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,131
Please stay by Yul's side.

189
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:46,635
I will find a way to save him and return.

190
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:00,065
You endangered the heir of the Seo family?

191
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:04,153
Jin Mu, you must take
full responsibility for this incident.

192
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,447
If this causes Seoho Fortress
to take action,

193
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,616
a war will be inevitable.

194
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:09,742
What will you do?

195
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:12,286
Look what you have done!

196
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:17,416
I summoned you all here

197
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,128
so that we could find
a way to prevent that outcome.

198
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:23,589
How would we know
how to remove a blood parasite

199
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:25,299
when we have never seen one before?

200
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:29,845
If Seo Yul dies,
you will also die at the hands of Jang Uk.

201
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:33,307
You must beg for his forgiveness at once
and sacrifice yourself!

202
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,643
Then at least we can prevent
a war from occurring!

203
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:36,936
You must do that!

204
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,229
- We cannot have a war!
- Take full responsibility!

205
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,481
Please calm down.

206
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,316
I desperately plead

207
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:44,860
for your help.

208
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:52,368
If the blood parasite is from Jinyowon,

209
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,870
then Lady Jin may know how to take it out.

210
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,998
But she has a heavy grudge
against Gwanju Jin Mu.

211
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,291
I doubt she will help.

212
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,501
He will have to beg.

213
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:02,753
Jinyowon is our only hope.

214
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,094
Ho-gyeong.

215
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,555
Please save your brother.

216
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:17,017
I have come here
to beg before you on my knees.

217
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,979
What a humiliating sight
for the Gwanju of Cheonbugwan.

218
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:23,607
I guess you must fear Jang Uk after all.

219
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,779
Jinyowon is not completely innocent either

220
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,572
since the blood parasite came from here.

221
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,617
That was done by Jin U-tak and you.
It had nothing to do with me.

222
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:35,577
Lady Jin.

223
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,205
If Seo Yul dies like this,

224
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:40,958
the Seo family will have resentment
toward you as well.

225
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,084
I am not afraid.

226
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,506
Let us say Seo Yul dies,
and my life is at stake.

227
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,967
Do you think I will die alone?

228
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:53,053
You and I are both from the Jin family.

229
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,513
We must share the responsibility

230
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,349
and Jinyowon must share my demise.

231
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:04,606
I command Lady Jin
to find a way to save Seo Yul

232
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,358
and make Jang Uk leave.

233
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:09,778
It is nerve-racking to know
that he is out there.

234
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,407
It suffocates me.

235
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,077
Find a way to settle this matter,

236
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:20,080
whether it is by sacrificing yourselves
or offering a solution.

237
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:33,676
As I said I would,

238
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,013
I have brought Jin Mu.

239
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,527
I believe there has been
a deep misunderstanding.

240
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:55,824
But as the Gwanju of Cheonbugwan,
I take full responsibility and apologize

241
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,535
for putting the heir
of the Seo family at risk.

242
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,163
No.

243
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,832
You should apologize to Yul, not me.

244
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:05,792
After curing him.

245
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,421
Of course.

246
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:12,549
That is exactly
why I have found a way to save him.

247
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:14,634
Ho-gyeong.

248
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:27,815
I have persuaded her and found a way.

249
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:35,988
Here we are

250
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,492
once again.

251
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,911
You have managed to drag me out at last

252
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,080
after causing all this mess.

253
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:45,706
That is why

254
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:50,087
you should have told me earlier
when I was asking politely.

255
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,968
So-i was not captured and brought here.

256
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,887
She came on her own
to save Yul, did she not?

257
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:04,351
So he was the one
she was desperately trying to save.

258
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:08,188
You know a way to remove
that blood parasite, right?

259
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:10,941
Yul is dying.

260
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,571
Please help him. I beg of you.

261
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:21,577
I am not interested
in whether he lives or dies.

262
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,416
I am sorry.

263
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,763
You said you were not interested,

264
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,099
so I tried to grab your attention.

265
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:45,683
And in the end,

266
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:47,436
here you are.

267
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,147
I did not have to move from this place.

268
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,821
You were not here to slay me after all.

269
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:01,533
You were using me to persuade her.

270
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:04,786
With my friend's life at stake,
my top priority is to save him.

271
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,706
Not to kill someone with the likes of you.

272
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,208
The likes of me?

273
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,843
You should have let me in on this
if you knew in advance.

274
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:25,307
Then I would not have had
to humiliate myself by apologizing to him.

275
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:30,812
I would have never suffered
the humiliation of coming here by myself.

276
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,066
You may go now.

277
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:37,903
Come to Jinyowon,
and I will tell you what the solution is.

278
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,338
You had been obedient
for the past three years.

279
00:20:56,421 --> 00:21:00,092
But you put everyone
in a state of panic simply by coming here.

280
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,678
Cheonbugwan, Songrim, Jinyowon,

281
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:06,306
the royal family, the Unanimous Assembly,
and even Seoho Fortress.

282
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,351
You sure are incredible.

283
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:12,937
Nevertheless,

284
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,234
I stopped like you asked me to.

285
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,117
Gwanju.

286
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:29,579
You should go to the constellation basin
and pray to the stars

287
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,999
that Yul will survive this ordeal
by whatever means.

288
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,043
If Yul does not survive,

289
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,255
you will surely die.

290
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:07,783
I am sorry.

291
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:10,203
I should have
immediately let the others know

292
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:12,998
when I detected that in you.

293
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,468
But all I can do is see.

294
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:29,973
There is nothing I can do.

295
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:34,978
Only three breaths.

296
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:38,857
I cherish all the memories
I had in Danhyanggok.

297
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,740
Do not touch him without permission.

298
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,205
Do you not understand
that he is in a dire situation?

299
00:22:57,292 --> 00:23:00,796
I heard you kept quiet all along
despite being aware of his condition.

300
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:06,843
Stop interfering and leave.

301
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,352
What was that just now?

302
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:28,824
Young Lady Heo.

303
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:32,285
I do not know which medicine
Young Master Seo has been taking.

304
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:34,704
He had packed up his belongings,
so I brought them all.

305
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,666
Are you looking for his medicine?

306
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:38,749
Yes.

307
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:51,804
What is that?

308
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:55,267
It seems to be
a letter sealed with energy.

309
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:58,520
I told you not to touch anything
without permission.

310
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,942
I thought maybe he wrote down
the name of his medicine.

311
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:05,527
I can look at it myself.

312
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:07,236
You should go.

313
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,831
Was Young Master Seo
the one who sealed it?

314
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:20,041
I believe so.

315
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:27,048
I asked him to come to Danhyanggok with me
when he was in pain.

316
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:33,388
But what was that memory about?

317
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:36,683
There is no way I went
to Danhyanggok with Seo Yul before.

318
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,476
Young Lady Bu-yeon.

319
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,813
There is a way. We can save Yul!

320
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:42,731
Is that so?

321
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:45,650
Lady Jin said there is a way
to remove the blood parasite.

322
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:49,029
My uncle and Uk have gone
to Jinyowon to speak with her.

323
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:53,700
My mother agreed to tell Uk
how to remove the blood parasite?

324
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:57,370
Yes, if Lady Jin helps us,
Yul will be able to live.

325
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:59,372
Uk will do anything she asks him to do.

326
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:01,499
He will save Yul at all costs.

327
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,043
I am sure he will.

328
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:08,590
He should.

329
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:10,758
At all costs.

330
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,345
The blood parasite is like an insect.

331
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:17,098
And birds are
the greatest predators of insects.

332
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:20,352
Jinyowon has the most powerful bird.

333
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:23,145
The fire bird.

334
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:27,859
The fire bird is the solution?

335
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:30,070
It is too dangerous.

336
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:33,114
It is dangerous, but it is not impossible.

337
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,701
Because we have Jang Uk.

338
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:42,999
I will do anything you want.
So please tell me how to save him.

339
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,168
In that case, let me ask you something.

340
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:47,963
You need my help to save him.

341
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:51,258
If I agree to help,
will you truly do anything I ask of you?

342
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,887
Send Bu-yeon back home.

343
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:58,723
Then I will help you.

344
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:00,934
If you refuse,

345
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:05,188
I will not help you.

346
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:08,984
In that case,
you will not be able to save him

347
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,528
even if you know how to.

348
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:13,153
All right.

349
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,323
I will do as you say.

350
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:17,950
So please help us.

351
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:22,204
As for Bu-yeon,

352
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:26,917
I will send her back.

353
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:30,212
Thank you.

354
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:35,802
Since you are a witness,
I will trust that Uk will keep his word.

355
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:39,931
I will help you save Seo Yul.

356
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:44,394
Thank you for agreeing to help.

357
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,109
The fire bird?

358
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:55,405
It may be dangerous,
but it is worth a shot.

359
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:58,867
Dang-gu, go fetch Cho-yeon.

360
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,702
We will need the Jin family's blood.

361
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,704
All right, I will fetch her right away.

362
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,790
You should go to Seoho Fortress.

363
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,668
If Yul's father hears strange rumors,

364
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,170
it will be a headache.

365
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:13,298
Let him know the details of the situation
and reassure him.

366
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:15,967
I will tell him
that Yul will live at all costs,

367
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,260
so please save him.

368
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:20,722
Uk, you have the biggest role.

369
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,682
You must enter Jinyowon.

370
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:26,311
You will meet someone
who will help you there.

371
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,855
- Do not fight with him.
- Him?

372
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:31,149
Who is he?

373
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:40,700
I will enter Jinyowon alongside Jang Uk.

374
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,953
If you argue in there
and awaken the fire bird,

375
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:47,832
this world will go down in flames.

376
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,628
This will be dangerous.

377
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:53,046
That is why, Lady Jin,

378
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:57,050
you must tell Jang Uk beforehand
that he must listen to me.

379
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:00,512
Come on. Do you think
the Crown Prince will listen to me?

380
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:04,224
If he does not swallow his pride
and listen to me, everything will fail.

381
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:06,267
He went to Master Heo himself

382
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,686
and offered to help save Yul.

383
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:11,314
Could it be because of the turtle?

384
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:13,608
What turtle?

385
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:18,863
He is acting like a turtle
and slowly crawling toward me.

386
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:22,242
Or you could be slowly letting him in.

387
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,245
But Uk…

388
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,541
Will you really be all right without her?

389
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:36,423
I did expect Lady Jin

390
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:39,926
to ask for her daughter back
in return for helping us.

391
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:42,303
If she goes back,

392
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:46,057
you will not be able to kill yourself
by removing that ice stone.

393
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,518
Just like how you made
those dreadful noodles for me,

394
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,812
I was comforted by someone else too.

395
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:53,064
That is when her words,

396
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:55,859
"It is better to die than to do nothing,"
came to mind.

397
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,568
In fact,

398
00:28:57,944 --> 00:29:00,655
it was her way of encouraging me
to do anything I could.

399
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:03,992
Uk,

400
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:07,412
who would you save
if Maidservant Kim and I were drowning?

401
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:08,413
Maidservant Kim.

402
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:10,081
You should save both of us, you fool.

403
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:14,627
Yul and Bu-yeon are drowning right now.

404
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:18,256
And you are planning to give up on her
because Yul is in grave danger.

405
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:20,717
Since he is in grave danger,

406
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,386
I cannot afford to think about saving her.

407
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,222
That is wrong.

408
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:31,227
If it is someone dear to you,

409
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:35,523
you should not think of letting them go
as if you are abandoning them.

410
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:46,075
I felt bad for keeping her by my side.

411
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:49,495
It is all…

412
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:52,874
for the best.

413
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:14,229
- I heard you went to Jinyowon.
- I did.

414
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:17,273
Did my mother tell you how to save Yul?

415
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,193
Yes.

416
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:21,528
That is a relief.

417
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:24,989
Let me help.

418
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,116
Maybe I could be of use as well.

419
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,954
You have already done
everything you could to help.

420
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:34,873
Still.

421
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,004
I should do everything I can
until the very end.

422
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:48,972
You do not need to do that.

423
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:52,057
Just stay here.

424
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:53,935
I will explain everything

425
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,479
once it is over.

426
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,072
I am not doing this for you.

427
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,283
He is my friend as well.

428
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:09,993
I feel indebted to him.

429
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:13,245
I want to help.

430
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:20,752
Fine.

431
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:22,796
You can help.

432
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:25,257
Let us go.

433
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:38,938
He chose to let me go.

434
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:48,656
Let me brief you
on this parasite-removal operation

435
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:52,201
that Master Heo has planned out for Yul.

436
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:55,413
A blood parasite
is in the core of his energy,

437
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:58,625
and it has sucked
all of his torrent of energy.

438
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:01,961
He can only live if we remove it
and leave his torrent of energy behind.

439
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:05,965
The fire bird can remove
the blood parasite from his body.

440
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:08,760
We must remove the blood parasite

441
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:12,680
with the energy of the fire bird
that is inside Jinyowon

442
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:15,558
and make it expel
the torrent of energy it has consumed.

443
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:18,561
But there are two critical issues.

444
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:21,856
First,

445
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,360
we cannot take him to Jinyowon,
given his state.

446
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,488
And the fire bird cannot
be taken out of Jinyowon either.

447
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:33,076
Second, it is too dangerous
to break the fire bird's barrier.

448
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:35,870
So we must use its energy
without breaking down the barrier.

449
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,539
The first issue is
already impossible to resolve.

450
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:41,501
We can neither move him nor the fire bird.

451
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,878
So how will it get rid of the parasite?

452
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,798
That is exactly why we called you here.

453
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:51,594
You must enter Jinyowon instead of him.

454
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:53,304
Me?

455
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,849
This is a water wick
that the Seo family uses

456
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:59,644
for their Lanterns of Life.

457
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:04,941
The Seo family fills
their wicks with their energy.

458
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:09,487
Then they connect their Lanterns of Life

459
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:10,989
with the core of their energy.

460
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:15,076
I am going to fill this
with the remainder of his energy.

461
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:17,662
Then the blood parasite will mistake this

462
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:21,082
for his core of energy
and enter it as well.

463
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,293
Then we can remove
the blood parasite with this.

464
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:26,045
Did I not tell you

465
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:27,797
that it must expel his torrent of energy?

466
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,881
But why

467
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:32,010
must I be the one to take it to Jinyowon?

468
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:36,931
That is because the blood parasite
was made with your family's blood.

469
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:38,975
Pardon?

470
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:41,644
Why do you think Jin Mu
put the parasite in So-i's body?

471
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:44,272
He put your family's energy
in the parasite

472
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,983
and put it inside her
so she could open the door to Jinyowon.

473
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:52,572
So the blood parasite was made
with Cho-yeon's blood.

474
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:57,452
Once the blood parasite mistakes this
for Yul's core of energy and enters it,

475
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,245
I will put this in Cho-yeon's body

476
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:03,166
since her blood's energy is identical
to that of the blood parasite.

477
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:07,045
- Would that not be dangerous?
- All you need to do

478
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:09,756
is put this in your mouth
and do not open it.

479
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:12,758
Then…

480
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:14,302
I will do it.

481
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:17,805
All right, this is something
you can do even without skills.

482
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,308
You will be fine as long as
you have no blood parasite

483
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:22,602
- and are not with child.
- Sorry?

484
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:24,812
Wait.

485
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,148
Young Lady Jin.

486
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,861
Remember that night?

487
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:36,574
The day we revisited
the house we were supposed to move into.

488
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:38,283
Maybe…

489
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:48,002
She cannot do it.

490
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,713
It will be too dangerous
if there is any chance she is pregnant.

491
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:51,797
You little…

492
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:58,763
Then do we need to ask Lady Jin to do it?

493
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:01,974
She must stay outside Jinyowon's door
and make sure the other relics

494
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:03,184
do not become agitated.

495
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:04,267
In that case,

496
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:06,437
I can do it.

497
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:09,649
But you two are already married.

498
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:12,110
Will you be all right with it?

499
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:13,693
We are fine.

500
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:16,280
There is no possibility of it.

501
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,659
- Not at all?
- No.

502
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:21,494
Not even the slightest chance.

503
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:26,039
She is right.

504
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:31,045
- I am telling you.
- I see.

505
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:36,843
Then you can be the one
to move his energy, Bu-yeon.

506
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:41,556
Goodness, we still need to tackle
the second problem.

507
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,184
How can we extract the fire bird's energy
without breaking its barrier?

508
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:48,646
The barrier of the fire bird is made
with an energy similar to that

509
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:52,191
of the volcano
where the fire bird was born.

510
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:56,028
It is made with the energy
of gold weighing 30,000 nyang.

511
00:35:56,696 --> 00:36:00,908
We must create the same energy
with the gold, expand the barrier,

512
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,493
and go inside.

513
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,872
The energy of 30,000 nyang of gold?

514
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:09,083
Where could we possibly get
that much gold right now?

515
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,389
Sang-ho is gathering the gold as we speak.

516
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:13,588
We are in a rush,

517
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:17,091
but I am afraid it will take some time
to gather such an amount.

518
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,593
I have 30,000 nyang of gold.

519
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:21,137
I also have that much fortune.

520
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,055
I just do not have it with me right now.

521
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,390
No, I have it right now.

522
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:28,144
It is at Jeongjingak.

523
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:29,312
What?

524
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:31,939
Here?

525
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,023
Yes.

526
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:48,932
I stashed the Crown Prince's rewards

527
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:50,666
for slaying the soul shifters here.

528
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:55,087
You just left all of this here?

529
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:56,631
I had nothing to spend them on

530
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,434
and could not be bothered
to take them home.

531
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,092
I get 1,000 nyang per kill,

532
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:02,345
so this is definitely
more than 30,000 nyang.

533
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:03,512
Great.

534
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:06,390
We are fully ready
to remove that blood parasite.

535
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:07,474
Let us begin.

536
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:10,561
Dang-gu and Cho-yeon,
move the gold to Jinyowon.

537
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:14,607
I will escort Bu-yeon
after she receives Yul's energy.

538
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:42,927
Yul will no longer have
any energy within him.

539
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:46,389
I will send all the energy in his core

540
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:50,476
to the Lantern of Life's water wick.

541
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:02,113
I can see the blood parasite's energy
moving upward from the core of his energy.

542
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:04,782
Now.

543
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,382
Open your mouth.

544
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:31,975
You are carrying

545
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:35,646
his remaining life in your mouth.

546
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,480
You must never

547
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:40,693
swallow it or open your mouth.

548
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:49,035
He only has that much time.

549
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:50,411
You must return

550
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,831
with his torrent of energy
before time is up.

551
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,959
Uk, I trust you on this.

552
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,336
We will come back

553
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:00,671
in time.

554
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:03,465
Let us go.

555
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:16,562
This is everything
I have rewarded Jang Uk with?

556
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,774
He did not use a single one of them.

557
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:22,151
Yul will live thanks to him.

558
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:26,322
We must protect Jinyowon's door
alongside my mother.

559
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:29,367
Please wait here, Your Royal Highness.

560
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:32,953
Jang Uk and my sister
will be arriving soon.

561
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:35,206
Bu-yeon will be here too?

562
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:38,334
Yes. Please do not argue with Uk.

563
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:39,417
Do not worry.

564
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:42,838
He and I share a turtle.

565
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:47,301
And it is a bright one.

566
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:54,767
Bu-yeon, why are you here?

567
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,477
Why are you also getting involved?

568
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:58,354
Have you not told her yet?

569
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:03,526
She is carrying
Seo Yul's energy in her mouth,

570
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:04,609
so she cannot speak.

571
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:10,699
The Crown Prince will be waiting
for you inside Jinyowon.

572
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:11,783
Go first.

573
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:24,463
If you do not keep your promise,

574
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:26,966
I will refuse to help.

575
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:29,802
I will keep my end of the bargain
and send her home, so…

576
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,263
you can rest assured.

577
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:55,744
Turtle Shaman?

578
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:56,912
Why are you here?

579
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,956
Did you find work at Jinyowon?

580
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:09,425
I am currently working
alongside the Crown Prince...

581
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:11,218
I mean, with His Royal Highness.

582
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:15,431
Thank you for waiting,
Your Royal Highness.

583
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:22,521
That is right.

584
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:24,815
I am the Crown Prince.

585
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:27,735
I have been him all along.

586
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:33,406
Hold on.

587
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:35,951
Then are you Jin Bu-yeon?

588
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:39,747
Yes, this is her.

589
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:43,459
Then she is a Jinyowon priestess,
not a shaman?

590
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:45,085
Do you know her?

591
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:46,795
Do you know him?

592
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:48,923
Then your husband is…

593
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:56,472
What is going on?

594
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:04,688
The turtle?

595
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:06,106
Right, the eunuch.

596
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:09,944
Him?

597
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:11,987
So the eunuch you mentioned

598
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:13,697
was His Royal Highness?

599
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:22,122
I finally understand

600
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:26,669
why you took care of my turtle.

601
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:29,462
Darn it.

602
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:43,811
His Royal Highness
offered to help save Seo Yul

603
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:45,688
so that he could save you as well.

604
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:52,570
I hope that was not
just an excuse he made.

605
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:56,448
Did you say
His Royal Highness brought this turtle?

606
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:59,076
He saved it from getting killed.

607
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:02,788
He is raising something
that is uselessly weak.

608
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:09,044
I will summon the gold's energy

609
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:11,714
and expand the barrier
that is surrounding the fire bird's egg.

610
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:13,007
Then you can catch

611
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:16,093
the blood parasite
as it escapes the water wick.

612
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:17,970
And it will come out of her body?

613
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:19,554
All right.

614
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:21,515
Shaman, come in.

615
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,612
So Uk was the one who was troubling you?

616
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:37,323
You must have suffered
more than I thought.

617
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:40,284
Right, did you find your own room?

618
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:43,805
I said you can live with me
if you failed to find your own room.

619
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,330
I live in a palace.

620
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:47,958
I did not lie
about having many rooms, right?

621
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:54,506
What are you doing? Make the energy surge.

622
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:30,542
The blood parasite
is moving through her bloodstream.

623
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:34,546
You need to wait until it expels
all of Yul's torrent of energy.

624
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:35,630
Hang in there.

625
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:51,563
It has expelled everything.

626
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:53,857
We just need to remove it.

627
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:54,941
Where is it?

628
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:25,764
Hang on.

629
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:32,938
Are you all right?

630
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:34,939
It must hurt a lot.

631
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:41,863
Let us now go to Yul.

632
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:43,698
Let us go.

633
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:00,174
Me too.

634
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:01,842
You must not break the barrier of gold.

635
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:03,594
Be careful on your way out.

636
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:06,054
Let us hurry. We have no time.

637
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:10,100
Help me out too.

638
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:19,318
Hey!

639
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:33,040
We are almost out of time.
Hurry, put it inside his mouth!

640
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:35,584
Put it inside! Right now!

641
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:37,168
Hurry!

642
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:10,702
We did it!

643
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:15,791
We did it!

644
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:17,376
We saved Yul!

645
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:21,797
Goodness, I can feel his pulse again.

646
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,549
Oh, my goodness.

647
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,259
We did it.

648
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:26,760
- We saved him.
- Yul is alive.

649
00:47:26,843 --> 00:47:29,304
- Yes, we did.
- Good work, Jang Uk.

650
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:32,683
You did well too,

651
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:34,851
Your Royal Highness.

652
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:42,316
By the way,

653
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:45,779
I cannot believe
you were the husband who troubled her.

654
00:47:45,862 --> 00:47:46,697
Gosh.

655
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:50,117
How did she mistake you for a eunuch?

656
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:53,662
We saved a turtle together.

657
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:59,501
I should invite her to the palace
and let her see the turtle next time.

658
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:03,338
If you are curious,

659
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:06,758
feel free to come with her.

660
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:13,265
The turtle?

661
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:31,032
Well done.

662
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:34,036
Thank you.

663
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:42,878
This letter was one of his belongings.

664
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:46,506
I should have given this to Lord Park
before he left for Seoho Fortress.

665
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,592
He already left.

666
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:49,675
I see.

667
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:51,261
I guess I am late.

668
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:53,221
Then I should put it back.

669
00:48:58,393 --> 00:49:00,771
The wound from where the parasite exited
could rot.

670
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:04,232
Apply the ointment
and take your medicine on time.

671
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:06,359
All right.

672
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:08,177
I will be fine even after I return.

673
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:12,324
I am not that dense.

674
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:14,618
I knew what my mother would ask for

675
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:17,204
in return for helping you.

676
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:20,957
She wants you to come back home.

677
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:24,878
- I agreed to send you back.
- Do not say that.

678
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:28,423
I am going back out of my own will.

679
00:49:30,967 --> 00:49:32,386
She gave me her word.

680
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:36,181
She promised not to lock me up anymore.

681
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:39,351
I have nothing to lose even if I leave.

682
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:43,522
- But I feel bad leaving you.
- What do you mean?

683
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:46,441
I promised to help you rest comfortably.

684
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:48,294
That is why you took me with you.

685
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:49,945
But I could not do that.

686
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:51,780
You are still mistaken.

687
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:54,449
That is not why I took you.

688
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:56,492
Then…

689
00:49:57,744 --> 00:49:58,745
what was the reason?

690
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:02,499
You do not need to know.

691
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:04,918
I have no use for you anymore.

692
00:50:05,001 --> 00:50:06,837
I am fine with you leaving as well.

693
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:09,256
So do not feel sorry for me.

694
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:11,758
They say you can miss the brazier
even during the summer.

695
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,094
Can you not just say
that you will miss me?

696
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:17,389
A brazier during the summer

697
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:20,225
is just useless.

698
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:22,601
Who knows?

699
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:24,228
Maybe I will miss you

700
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:27,649
when it gets chilly.

701
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:32,695
Fine.

702
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:36,575
Your useless brazier has burnt itself
to leave nothing but ashes.

703
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:39,244
I will disperse in the wind, and you can…

704
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,125
just freeze to death alone.

705
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:10,609
His torrent of energy is surging
in his core of energy again.

706
00:51:10,692 --> 00:51:14,446
The fire bird's energy
completely banished the blood parasite.

707
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:17,657
Did you say Jang Uk and the Crown Prince
saw the fire bird themselves?

708
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:18,617
Yes, Master.

709
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:22,662
Thankfully, they did not bicker
and kept the fire bird under control.

710
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:24,372
Yul survived thanks to them.

711
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:25,957
I had told the Crown Prince

712
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:29,127
to check on Uk
on the pretext of rewarding him.

713
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:31,880
And it paid off.

714
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:40,555
You saved my life once again.

715
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:42,848
This is different.

716
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:45,268
I saved you last time to kill Jang Uk.

717
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:46,352
But this time,

718
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:50,982
he and I joined hands to save Seo Yul.

719
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:53,235
In any case,

720
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:57,697
let me once again give you something
as a token of my gratitude.

721
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:13,797
This is Jang Uk's constellation plate.

722
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,215
Is that the King's Star?

723
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:18,134
Correct, Your Royal Highness.

724
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:20,428
Like Jang Gang prophesized,

725
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:22,681
it is the star of the late king's son.

726
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:27,393
The late king's son?

727
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:30,187
Jang Uk

728
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:33,441
is the son of the late king
who shifted souls with Jang Gang.

729
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:36,152
That is why he has the King's Star.

730
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:39,739
He has the Gold Plaque and the letter

731
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,992
that the late king
had left behind for him.

732
00:52:42,075 --> 00:52:46,329
He is a dangerous star
who can take your place whenever he wants.

733
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,340
Is that why you told me
to keep my distance from him?

734
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:02,137
Please allow me to send him far away,

735
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:05,181
Your Royal Highness.

736
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:21,740
You must have used up a lot of your energy
while protecting Jinyowon.

737
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:24,868
Your hair

738
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:27,829
has become grayer in the past few days.

739
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:32,625
Cho-yeon.

740
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:35,420
Prepare Bu-yeon's room for her.

741
00:53:35,503 --> 00:53:37,756
Is she coming back?

742
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:40,759
Jang Uk gave me his word.

743
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:43,011
So she will return soon.

744
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:51,144
Young Master,

745
00:53:51,227 --> 00:53:53,563
is Young Master Seo all right now?

746
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:56,858
Yes, I wanted to be there when he woke up.

747
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:59,486
But I left in case my energy
would be harmful to him.

748
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:01,071
That is a relief.

749
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:05,367
You did a terrific job
of saving your friend.

750
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:07,785
What about Bu-yeon?

751
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:10,121
- Did she go safely?
- Young Lady Bu-yeon?

752
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:13,166
She did not come home.

753
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:15,669
I thought you two were in Songrim.

754
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:17,462
She did not come home?

755
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:22,092
What is this? Did she leave right away
without saying goodbye to you?

756
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:23,009
Leave?

757
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:25,929
Did she return to Jinyowon?

758
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:29,766
Yes, I promised Lady Jin that I would
send her back to where she belonged.

759
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:31,476
Did you, now?

760
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,228
I see.

761
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:35,271
Young Master, give me your hand.

762
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:36,564
Give it to me.

763
00:54:37,273 --> 00:54:40,485
Darn it! She is not an object
you can send back whenever you want!

764
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:43,154
I only said that
because that is where she belongs.

765
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:45,824
She belongs right by your side,
does she not?

766
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:51,413
She never belonged here
in the first place.

767
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,211
Goodness.

768
00:54:58,878 --> 00:55:01,589
He will never know what he had
until it is gone.

769
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:04,759
You will keep going back and forth.

770
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:06,845
Goodness, I hope

771
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:09,806
he comes to his senses.

772
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:16,603
She left right away

773
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:19,190
that day?

774
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:22,861
Your useless brazier has burnt itself
to leave nothing but ashes.

775
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:25,363
I will disperse in the wind, and you can…

776
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,825
just freeze to death alone.

777
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:45,550
Her mother

778
00:55:46,801 --> 00:55:48,428
would not do that again, would she?

779
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:07,404
I hope…

780
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:09,991
that makes it easier for you to find me.

781
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:11,910
I will keep you warm

782
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:13,745
and help you rest comfortably.

783
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:19,959
There, now you feel warm.

784
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:40,563
She left it here.

785
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:42,524
It would have made
a good excuse to go see her.

786
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:47,278
I hope she arrived safely.

787
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:01,501
You can turn off the last lantern.

788
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:03,795
Since you are
a great priestess of Jinyowon,

789
00:57:03,878 --> 00:57:05,672
use your divine powers to turn it off.

790
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,973
See? I did that.

791
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:43,084
Yul.

792
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:56,431
Young Master Seo, are you finally awake?

793
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:00,059
What happened?

794
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:01,853
You were unconscious for three days.

795
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:05,273
You almost lost your life
while fighting Cheonbugwan officials.

796
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:11,279
What happened to So-i?

797
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:15,366
Do you mean the girl
you went there to save?

798
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:16,659
She died.

799
00:58:18,953 --> 00:58:21,789
Lord Dang-gu took her body.

800
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:24,292
Master Heo and your friends

801
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:26,920
successfully removed
the blood parasite from your body.

802
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:28,713
They took it out?

803
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:30,589
Yes, they did.

804
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:43,645
Are you finally awake?

805
00:58:47,148 --> 00:58:48,441
You were in grave danger.

806
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:52,487
Young Lady Bu-yeon was of great help
in getting rid of that parasite.

807
00:58:53,821 --> 00:58:56,241
Had I known it was life-threatening,

808
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:57,684
I would not have kept it a secret.

809
00:58:58,243 --> 00:58:59,243
I am sorry.

810
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:02,580
I had no idea
when I invited you to Danhyanggok.

811
00:59:06,584 --> 00:59:08,378
We had agreed to go there.

812
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:13,090
But we could not go.

813
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:20,431
Master Lee,
Seo Yul has regained consciousness.

814
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:24,602
- Master Lee?
- This is Master Lee.

815
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:26,854
He has been taking care of you.

816
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,274
He knows Master Lee.

817
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:31,651
He is Master Heo's master.

818
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:34,612
The "frivolous Yeom"
that you often talked about

819
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:36,406
was Master Heo?

820
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:38,992
I found him adorable when he was your age.

821
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:40,075
Every now and then.

822
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:44,831
He took care of me
for three years when I was ill.

823
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:48,418
He is the top physician in Daeho,
so you will recover soon.

824
00:59:48,501 --> 00:59:49,335
Bu-yeon.

825
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:51,254
Bring Yeom over.

826
00:59:51,337 --> 00:59:52,880
He will be delighted to see Yul awake.

827
00:59:52,964 --> 00:59:54,257
Yes, Master.

828
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:04,058
You have regained
almost all of your torrent of energy,

829
01:00:04,142 --> 01:00:05,310
so you will recover soon.

830
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:08,688
If you took care of her for three years,

831
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,149
then you must know her well.

832
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,987
Are you more curious about her
than your condition right now?

833
01:00:16,654 --> 01:00:18,656
That is right. I saved her.

834
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:21,284
And I will take good care of you now.

835
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:28,958
Young Lady Bu-yeon
is in Sejukwon right now?

836
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:30,376
Yes.

837
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:33,129
Her mother thinks she is still at Uk's,

838
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:35,923
and Uk must think she is in Jinyowon.

839
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:38,801
Is it really over between them?

840
01:00:39,844 --> 01:00:43,556
Whenever she left our house,
he would bring her back every time.

841
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,391
She must be in Songrim

842
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:48,728
waiting for Uk to come and fetch her.

843
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:51,356
Just let them be.

844
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:55,985
There he is.

845
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:58,613
You only appreciate someone
once you feel their absence.

846
01:00:58,696 --> 01:00:59,864
My lord.

847
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:02,575
How was your trip?

848
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:03,910
You must be so tired.

849
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:08,039
I hurried over because I knew
you would be waiting for me.

850
01:01:08,122 --> 01:01:10,541
Goodness. He is watching us.

851
01:01:12,251 --> 01:01:13,251
Come inside.

852
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:17,507
You should not move around just yet.

853
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:21,052
Were you already aware

854
01:01:22,553 --> 01:01:23,553
of who she was?

855
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:27,951
You must know if you saved the body
fished out of Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.

856
01:01:27,975 --> 01:01:29,811
So you recognized her face.

857
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:34,273
I do remember you saying that
you met her in Danhyanggok as a child.

858
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:36,317
Does this mean
you saved her despite knowing

859
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:39,361
who she was?

860
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:41,363
Seo Yul.

861
01:01:41,989 --> 01:01:44,867
If you are the only one
who knows about this,

862
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:46,369
then feign ignorance.

863
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:51,666
Naksu's soul will disappear
from her body soon.

864
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:55,837
Once the soul of Jin Bu-yeon,
the true owner of that body, awakens,

865
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,464
Naksu's soul will disappear.

866
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:00,424
What?

867
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:03,594
I do not understand.

868
01:02:04,178 --> 01:02:06,180
Two souls are coexisting in her body.

869
01:02:06,681 --> 01:02:08,808
But the body belongs to Jin Bu-yeon.

870
01:02:10,935 --> 01:02:12,353
Contrary to my intentions,

871
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:15,148
everything went according to
Jin Bu-yeon's plans.

872
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:18,025
She will use up Naksu's energy.

873
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:21,821
And Naksu will soon disappear.

874
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:31,914
Young Lady Heo!

875
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:33,750
Master Heo is looking for you!

876
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:36,085
All right, Sun-i.

877
01:02:37,503 --> 01:02:39,756
I will be there soon. You can go first.

878
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:42,549
Yes, my lady.

879
01:02:45,052 --> 01:02:48,389
Is that not Young Master Seo's letter?

880
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:50,349
Is she peeking at it?

881
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:56,773
That woman…

882
01:02:59,984 --> 01:03:01,027
is Naksu?

883
01:03:07,241 --> 01:03:09,744
If it is someone dear to you,

884
01:03:09,827 --> 01:03:12,997
you should not think of letting them go
as if you are abandoning them.

885
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:15,917
She belongs right by your side,
does she not?

886
01:03:23,841 --> 01:03:26,636
It turned off. Did she break it?

887
01:03:30,681 --> 01:03:32,099
It keeps turning on and off.

888
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:34,477
It must be out of its mind.

889
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:37,814
I was hoping for this.

890
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:40,358
I hoped that you would come for me…

891
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:43,778
despite being of no use to you.

892
01:03:51,577 --> 01:03:52,870
I would be crazy

893
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:56,249
if I went back for her again.

894
01:04:01,212 --> 01:04:04,048
If you drink that,
it means we are officially married.

895
01:04:04,131 --> 01:04:06,050
Go on. Drink up.

896
01:04:11,013 --> 01:04:12,333
I shall always stay by your side.

897
01:04:13,224 --> 01:04:14,559
Try summoning fireflies.

898
01:04:14,642 --> 01:04:17,436
That is not an easy thing to do, you know.

899
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,397
Get a hold of yourself.

900
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:25,278
This is driving me crazy.

901
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:31,492
Mother knows you are here.

902
01:04:31,576 --> 01:04:32,743
She told me to fetch you.

903
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:34,370
I was going to go today anyway.

904
01:04:35,496 --> 01:04:36,664
I ran into Master Lee.

905
01:04:36,747 --> 01:04:38,624
He had been taking care of Seo Yul,

906
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:40,626
and I wanted to see him wake up.

907
01:04:42,795 --> 01:04:44,922
Jang Uk thinks you are in Jinyowon.

908
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:48,217
He will not come here for you.

909
01:04:50,469 --> 01:04:51,469
I know.

910
01:04:53,639 --> 01:04:54,639
Let us go.

911
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:58,728
I need to return
Songrim's Spirit Plaque before I go.

912
01:04:58,811 --> 01:05:00,062
I left it at Jeongjingak.

913
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:02,023
Let me go get it. Wait here.

914
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:28,120
You will be flogged 100 times
if you lose this, you know.

915
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:35,598
I did not lose it.

916
01:05:35,681 --> 01:05:36,681
What is it?

917
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:38,643
Do you want me to get punished?

918
01:05:43,898 --> 01:05:45,483
I could not find you in Jinyowon.

919
01:05:46,567 --> 01:05:47,567
Here you were.

920
01:05:48,569 --> 01:05:50,821
Were you looking for me?

921
01:05:52,865 --> 01:05:53,865
Why?

922
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:57,328
Because the lantern turned off.

923
01:05:57,411 --> 01:05:58,411
And then,

924
01:05:59,705 --> 01:06:00,539
it turned back on.

925
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:02,708
Lantern? The one in your study?

926
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:05,252
It kept flicking on and off.
It is out of its mind.

927
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:09,382
It must be broken.

928
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:11,332
Throw it out if it is useless.

929
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:13,218
Right.

930
01:06:13,719 --> 01:06:15,304
It belonged to Jinyowon, right?

931
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:18,307
Then send it back.

932
01:06:18,891 --> 01:06:21,172
You think I abandoned you
because you were useless, right?

933
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:22,812
To clear up the confusion,

934
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:25,648
I should clearly explain
what your use was.

935
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:29,402
I brought you home

936
01:06:30,903 --> 01:06:32,822
so you could take the ice stone out of me.

937
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:34,489
I know.

938
01:06:35,032 --> 01:06:36,909
You said it would help you feel at ease.

939
01:06:38,494 --> 01:06:39,494
Right.

940
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:41,747
I wanted to find peace.

941
01:06:43,624 --> 01:06:44,667
But once it is removed,

942
01:06:46,293 --> 01:06:47,294
I will die once again.

943
01:06:48,879 --> 01:06:51,048
It is not your fault
that you did not know this.

944
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:52,758
I should have been clear about it.

945
01:06:53,884 --> 01:06:55,845
At first, I did not
see the need to explain.

946
01:06:56,971 --> 01:06:59,691
Later, I could not disclose that
to someone who wanted to protect me.

947
01:07:02,727 --> 01:07:03,727
And what about now?

948
01:07:04,311 --> 01:07:05,646
I said I have no use for you.

949
01:07:09,066 --> 01:07:10,860
What I am trying to say is

950
01:07:12,945 --> 01:07:14,196
that I am very grateful

951
01:07:15,573 --> 01:07:16,949
and sorry.

952
01:07:21,078 --> 01:07:22,078
In that case,

953
01:07:23,122 --> 01:07:25,166
I am glad that I am of no use to you.

954
01:07:26,667 --> 01:07:28,252
I felt awful for being abandoned.

955
01:07:29,503 --> 01:07:32,381
But you are thanking me
and apologizing to me.

956
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:35,593
So that is why you came.

957
01:07:37,094 --> 01:07:39,096
I heard you loud and clear,
so I will go now.

958
01:07:40,556 --> 01:07:42,183
I cannot wish you farewell, though.

959
01:07:45,019 --> 01:07:46,353
What is it this time?

960
01:07:46,854 --> 01:07:49,541
Do you want me to brace myself
because you could have a change of heart?

961
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:52,568
I better not see you ever again,

962
01:07:52,651 --> 01:07:54,361
or I will take that stone out of you.

963
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:56,196
I am not done yet.

964
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:58,657
I told you the lantern was flickering.

965
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:00,618
- So what?
- So…

966
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:06,624
When it is on, I am sane.

967
01:08:07,666 --> 01:08:08,666
It is clear to me

968
01:08:09,835 --> 01:08:11,837
that I must send you back as I promised.

969
01:08:12,421 --> 01:08:14,340
But I go insane when it turns off.

970
01:08:14,965 --> 01:08:16,050
I just pine for you.

971
01:08:18,177 --> 01:08:19,637
That is why I came to see you.

972
01:08:28,395 --> 01:08:29,395
So?

973
01:08:32,983 --> 01:08:33,983
What about now?

974
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:37,738
If you are upset and want to leave,

975
01:08:41,158 --> 01:08:42,535
I should get a hold of myself…

976
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:46,538
and let you go.

977
01:09:02,096 --> 01:09:02,930
What was that?

978
01:09:03,013 --> 01:09:04,431
I turned it off.

979
01:09:08,352 --> 01:09:09,478
I wanted to turn it off.

980
01:10:36,982 --> 01:10:39,902

01:10:39,985 --> 01:10:41,445
I knew the moment I saw you.

982
01:10:41,528 --> 01:10:42,528
You are my husband.

983
01:10:42,988 --> 01:10:44,281
"I promise to be a good man."

984
01:10:44,365 --> 01:10:46,617
"Please allow me to marry your daughter."

985
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:48,762
Just let her stay
with the person she wishes to be with

986
01:10:48,786 --> 01:10:49,620
for a while.

987
01:10:49,703 --> 01:10:51,640
If you do not intend
to fight me over the Gold Plaque,

988
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:53,582
go to North Fortress, Jang Uk.

989
01:10:53,666 --> 01:10:55,751
I have decided to accept this fight

990
01:10:55,834 --> 01:10:57,114
in order to protect what I must.

991
01:10:57,169 --> 01:11:00,005
I will soon introduce you
to the secret organization.

992
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:01,382
I shall wholly support you.

993
01:11:01,465 --> 01:11:02,785
Naksu's soul will disappear soon,

994
01:11:02,841 --> 01:11:05,386
and Jin Bu-yeon will take over the body.

995
01:11:06,053 --> 01:11:09,515
Allow me to test your divine powers.

996
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:16,939
