1
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:39,664
What an insane thing to do!

2
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:43,043
Is killing and bringing one
back to life entertaining to watch?

3
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:45,003
We cannot even intervene

4
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:47,797
because Mu-deok foolishly agreed to it.

5
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,300
That girl…

6
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,053
smiled.

7
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,681
Yes. I will try it.

8
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,396
She only said yes

9
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,316
because of the gold she would be getting.

10
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,110
Could gold really be the reason…

11
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:13,615
why she smiled?

12
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,962
I am not happy
about this situation either.

13
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:31,299
I will make sure you die a painless death.

14
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:33,802
This is not to see me die.

15
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:37,055
It is to see me come back to life.

16
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:43,645
They will try to buy time with that book
and look for a way to expose you.

17
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,731
When she dies
and the ice stone's power is summoned,

18
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:50,443
use the ice stone's power
to shift your soul into that girl's body.

19
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:54,197
The Unanimous Assembly will come
to an end once the Queen dies.

20
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:59,035
We will safely leave Songrim
with the ice stone.

21
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:05,375
I wonder why His Majesty
chose her of all people.

22
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,253
She is the weakest one among us.

23
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:09,963
He picked the right person.

24
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:19,324
You look beautiful.

25
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,368
My Bu-yeon.

26
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,337
Mother.

27
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,869
No one is looking at you right now.

28
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,704
Use that power to shift souls.

29
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:09,082
It is not me.

30
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:12,001
I am not the one controlling
the ice stone.

31
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:13,753
Then who?

32
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:01,634
You need to stop that.

33
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,815
Mother, are you all right?

34
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,112
Bu-yeon.

35
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,702
Did she recognize her? This is not good.

36
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,204
They are going to bring her back to life.

37
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,123
That cannot happen.

38
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:33,541
She needs to die.

39
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,338
What is going on?

40
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,590
Where is the ice stone?

41
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:27,595
What just happened?

42
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:41,567
Did you see that?

43
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,821
The power of the ice stone
and the power of the sky came together.

44
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,990
The heavens must have taken the ice stone
and made it disappear.

45
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,618
It did not disappear.

46
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:56,457
It is

47
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:58,501
still here.

48
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:02,505
Where exactly is it?

49
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:32,243
Lightning, thunder, and now fog
in broad daylight?

50
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:33,953
That is not all.

51
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,413
Something has gone awry.

52
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,339
- The cloth covering the ice stone, right?
- Yes.

53
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:46,863
Could something have happened to it?

54
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,469
Is this a dream or something?

55
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:52,638
- There are flowers everywhere.
- This feels surreal.

56
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:55,349
Are we dead?

57
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,436
- Are we in utopia?
- Hey.

58
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,146
Do not speak nonsense.

59
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:03,065
Then would that make me the Jade Emperor,
and him a fairy?

60
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,360
A fairy.

61
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,622
What is that?

62
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,957
I do not think it is a fairy.

63
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,001
Then is it a ghost?

64
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:33,679
Are you mages?

65
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:36,641
Yes, we are from Jeongjingak.

66
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,021
You were here too, Young Lady Heo.

67
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,568
Please let go of me.

68
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,783
Jang Uk, remain here and stand guard.

69
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:55,826
You three.

70
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:57,620
Patrol the area.

71
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:01,374
- I will head to the Training Center.
- Your Royal Highness, we will escort you.

72
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,878
What is going on?

73
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,213
I heard deafening thunder.

74
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,423
We do not know yet either.

75
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:13,219
We will find out soon once this fog lifts.

76
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,638
If we are not in utopia or the afterlife,

77
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,099
where did all these flowers come from?

78
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:20,768
Is this even a real fog?

79
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,180
What are you doing?

80
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,181
We do not know what happened.

81
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:02,727
The moment we reached the gate,
a strong gust of wind hit us.

82
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:03,936
Wind?

83
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,564
There is no wind.

84
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:12,486
Do not go there. We cannot see it,

85
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,447
but there is great energy blocking us.

86
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,782
What in the world is going on?

87
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:17,866
It is a barrier.

88
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:21,954
I believe there is a barrier
around Jeongjingak.

89
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,040
A barrier?

90
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,625
Who would place a barrier here?

91
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,876
Your Royal Highness.

92
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,338
Your Royal Highness.

93
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,715
A priestess from Jinyowon
is inside Jeongjingak.

94
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,801
Jin Bu-yeon,
who had brought the ice stone,

95
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,553
was found collapsed in the building.

96
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:49,898
Mu-deok.

97
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:09,794
The ice stone's energy entered Jeongjingak

98
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,879
and created a barrier.

99
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,758
Who is inside Jeongjingak?

100
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,594
Jang Uk and Seo Yul
are nowhere to be seen.

101
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:19,970
They must be in there.

102
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,515
Young Lady Heo is inside as well.

103
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:25,101
- My dear Yun-ok!
- The Crown Prince.

104
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,727
He is in there!

105
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:30,940
- What?
- Was Beom in there as well?

106
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,150
Where is Jin-ho?

107
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,111
Lady Jin.

108
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,404
Do something.

109
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:39,698
The ice stone swallowed up your daughter,
so she must be in there too.

110
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,326
We cannot be rash.

111
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,788
We all witnessed what happened
after Bu-yeon provoked it.

112
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,834
This is all Jinyowon's fault.

113
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,838
You wanted to see
how powerful the ice stone was.

114
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:55,714
Why are you placing the blame on us?

115
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:59,301
Are you trying to pick a fight again?

116
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,054
That is enough. The kids are in there!

117
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,722
Yun-ok!

118
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,159
Do you have anything to do

119
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,995
with the barrier around Jeongjingak?

120
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,872
What happened back at the Training Center?

121
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,207
You see…

122
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,303
It definitely all happened
because of Mu-deok.

123
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:45,764
After all, she is the real Jin Bu-yeon,
the priestess of Jinyowon.

124
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:48,267
But everyone thinks I am her.

125
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,603
I cannot say that it was because of her.

126
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:51,686
What do I do?

127
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:53,856
Answer me.

128
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,191
I…

129
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:57,985
Do not know.

130
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:01,322
I am blind,
so I could not see what had happened.

131
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:04,158
I fainted when the wind struck
and just woke up.

132
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,160
You do not know how you came here?

133
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:08,704
I do not even know where I am,

134
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:11,582
so how am I to know how I came here?

135
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:18,214
She does not look too well.

136
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:21,926
The color has drained from her face
and she is sweating.

137
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,594
What do you think?

138
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:28,224
I think you should let her rest first,
Your Royal Highness.

139
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:32,686
Let her rest.

140
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,022
Come.

141
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:41,946
She must be lying.

142
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:44,698
What is she hiding?

143
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,158
Mu-deok would know.

144
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,577
Mu-deok, you were with her, right?

145
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,873
How did you end up here?

146
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:56,794
I was here all along.

147
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,006
You were here?

148
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:04,510
Were you not pouring tea
at the Training Center?

149
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:08,889
I was, but then
I followed you here immediately.

150
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:11,976
I do not know what happened back there.

151
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,854
What is the point in asking a maid

152
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:20,234
who knows nothing
but to follow her master like a puppy?

153
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:21,860
Do not worry, Your Royal Highness.

154
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,822
The best mages have gathered
for the Unanimous Assembly.

155
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:27,283
This barrier will be broken in no time.

156
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,286
Bring some tea for the Crown Prince.

157
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,453
Yes, of course.

158
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:47,344
A puppy who only follows her master.

159
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,388
A maid who knows nothing.

160
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,641
That is Mu-deok.

161
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,316
Look at that.

162
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,109
There is no water to boil.

163
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,755
Spell-brewed tea tastes the best.

164
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,800
It has been a while.

165
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:14,974
I have finally regained my power
thanks to the ice stone.

166
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,819
What is going on? Where am I?

167
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,864
We did not lose it this time.

168
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,701
We are inside the ice stone.

169
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,204
This is the ice stone?

170
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:40,958
The ice stone is not limited
in shape, size, or form.

171
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,794
It can be water, fire,

172
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,546
or wind.

173
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,011
Does this mean I have the ice stone now?

174
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,603
No one can truly own the ice stone.

175
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,065
You only use its power.

176
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,776
Pull and get pushed.

177
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,903
Earn one, and lose the other.

178
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:12,948
That is the burden you will have to carry.

179
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,534
I can gladly endure that.

180
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:17,202
Then try it.

181
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,329
Overflowing power means

182
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:22,666
you will not be able to control
how much of it you use.

183
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,003
Desire rain, and you will get a flood.

184
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:29,548
Desire wind, and you will get a typhoon.

185
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:31,592
Try to endure it.

186
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,302
What are you?

187
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,512
A relic of Jinyowon?

188
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,849
How dare a soul living off my body

189
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,226
call me a relic?

190
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:11,173
Jeongjingak?

191
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,889
What was that?

192
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:23,268
A relic from Jinyowon
that had attached itself to the ice stone?

193
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,819
Mu-deok, what is this?

194
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:34,571
The Crown Prince's teacup is chipped.

195
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,365
I am sorry.

196
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,533
Let me get a new one.

197
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:41,411
No. I do not need
to be servile any longer.

198
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:42,955
- Mu-deok.
- Yes, young master.

199
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,958
The table is dirty. Wipe it clean.

200
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,168
I do not hesitate to be subservient.

201
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,337
Have I become Mu-deok to the bone?

202
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,761
I am no longer Mu-deok.

203
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:58,845
Mu-deok.

204
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:06,937
We have not eaten anything all day
due to the Unanimous Assembly.

205
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,438
Do you have any food?

206
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,733
The sujebi we have
as a late-night snack is tasty.

207
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:12,817
Can you make some?

208
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,952
I will only be Mu-deok
until I make this dish.

209
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:26,290
After this, I will no longer be her.

210
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,710
Once I can shift souls,

211
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:32,171
I can choose any body I want.

212
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,966
I could even be the King.

213
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,184
Or should I kill my enemy

214
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,603
and take over his body?

215
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:57,988
How distasteful.

216
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:01,450
I would rather choose Park Jin.

217
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,378
I can pick any body I want.

218
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,505
Let me think this through.

219
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,717
This is perfect.

220
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,094
It would be a waste
to make sujebi with this.

221
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,763
Should I make noodles instead?

222
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,806
Uk prefers noodles.

223
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,648
I do get a very faint taste of it.

224
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:43,325
This will be the last meal
Mu-deok makes for her young master.

225
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:54,878
- Young Master.
- Yes?

226
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,049
I made some noodles. Go and have some.

227
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:00,342
Sure.

228
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:07,432
As your maid, I shall leave you now.

229
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:10,519
And…

230
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,564
this will be the end, my pupil.

231
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,317
The end?

232
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:21,071
You probably did not realize it.

233
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,448
But we are inside the ice stone.

234
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:26,557
I regained my power like I did
back at Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.

235
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,789
I will use this ice stone to shift souls

236
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:33,375
and leave this body.

237
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:36,670
Are you saying

238
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,381
you will not ever see me again?

239
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,341
We agreed that it would be the end

240
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,885
once I regained my power.

241
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,847
But we agreed
to talk about our future as well.

242
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,355
There is…

243
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:58,775
no other future for us.

244
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,870
Earn one, and lose the other.

245
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:12,831
That is the burden you will have to carry.

246
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,418
If I need to lose you to regain my power,

247
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,421
I will bear it.

248
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,602
- Young Master.
- Yes?

249
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,771
I made some noodles. Go and have some.

250
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,065
- And...
- Mu-deok.

251
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:40,233
I think the barrier around Jeongjingak

252
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,194
is actually the ice stone.

253
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:43,778
What?

254
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:46,698
That is not something
he should have realized.

255
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,494
They said the ice stone
was water, fire, and wind.

256
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,156
I think we are trapped
within a force created by wind.

257
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:56,374
If we are indeed inside the ice stone,

258
00:22:56,917 --> 00:23:00,253
could there be a way to take the ice stone
without anyone knowing?

259
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:04,174
I am not sure.

260
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:05,884
After all, I have reached Chisu.

261
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,529
Could I snatch it
like I did with the Golden Fish?

262
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:11,014
Your current power cannot hold a candle

263
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:12,808
to the ice stone.

264
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:18,396
I wish you had regained your power
like you did at Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.

265
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,567
You would be able to do it.

266
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,447
What if I regained my power

267
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:30,283
and took the ice stone with me?

268
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,996
If caught, you may even be killed for it.

269
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:37,415
Are you not afraid?

270
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:40,210
The fact that you could run away with it

271
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:42,212
is always a possibility.

272
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:47,050
And I already told you
that I was going to take responsibility.

273
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,181
However,

274
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:55,559
I am still a bit afraid.

275
00:23:56,935 --> 00:24:01,398
I am scared that you may break our promise
and abandon me without even looking back.

276
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:04,483
Master.

277
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:08,238
Please do not abandon me.
If you do, I will cry a river.

278
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:14,661
You say such embarrassing things
so openly.

279
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,998
You will regret it when you look back.

280
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:23,253
I can always say such things
if I endure the embarrassment.

281
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:26,923
But I can never turn back time
even if I regret something.

282
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:31,303
Master, endure the embarrassment

283
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:32,888
and be honest with yourself.

284
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:35,891
That way, you will not regret anything.

285
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,024
- Jang Uk, I...
- Young Master Jang.

286
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:48,737
I will be right there.

287
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:51,573
She has the key
to the room of forbidden books.

288
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:54,326
Since we are here,
I want to look up some things.

289
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:56,453
Right, here.

290
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,892
Have it all. Do not let others find out.

291
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:33,281
Are you looking
for forbidden books regarding sorcery?

292
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,492
Yes, I heard that my father stored

293
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:39,037
all the sorcery books that he had gotten
from a shaman here.

294
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,332
I want to look for them.

295
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:47,420
So they were Lord Jang Gang's.

296
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:49,965
I will help you.

297
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:53,510
I can do it alone.
You can leave the key with me and go.

298
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:57,389
My grandfather entrusted me with it.

299
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:59,432
How can I trust
that you will keep it safe?

300
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:03,520
You are right. I am not that trustworthy.
You can keep an eye on me.

301
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:23,415
Attention, everyone.

302
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:28,753
We have enough spare rooms
and food at Jeongjingak.

303
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:32,257
So do not worry too much.

304
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,425
Let us remain calm.

305
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:34,634
All right?

306
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:46,604
Go to Gisan and summon everyone there.

307
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:49,441
We deserve some power
from the ice stone as well.

308
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:50,608
Yes, master.

309
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,947
Summon everyone who can cast spells.

310
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,907
Even children and the elderly.

311
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,242
- Yes, my lord.
- Yes, my lord.

312
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:10,295
Summon all the mages in Cheonbugwan
to Songrim.

313
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:12,922
A fight could break out
over the ice stone.

314
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:14,924
We need to be prepared.

315
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,217
Yes, Your Highness.

316
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:24,851
Your Majesty.

317
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:26,770
You do not look well.

318
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:28,855
You should go back to the palace.

319
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:32,734
I must witness it myself.

320
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,278
Since we have the ice stone,

321
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:38,281
the King's Star will appear as well.

322
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,966
Everyone must be waiting
for Words of the Heart.

323
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,844
Let us hurry.

324
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:09,437
Master.

325
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:10,897
Here is Words of the Heart.

326
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,816
That is not the priority right now.

327
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:14,699
A barrier has been created
around Jeongjingak.

328
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:16,403
Pardon?

329
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:26,121
Will I eventually get caught?

330
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:30,333
Then I will meet my demise.

331
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:53,356
It is a honey biscuit.

332
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:57,068
You were barely eating. Please have some.

333
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:03,283
Thank you.

334
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,246
Were you surprised to find out
that I was the Jin family's daughter?

335
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:11,750
When we first met,
I hadn't found my parents yet.

336
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,544
This is your umbrella.

337
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,423
I have kept it with me at all times.

338
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:20,717
I thought you would recognize it
if we met again.

339
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:27,140
Assistant Gwanju Jin Mu
helped you find your parents?

340
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:28,224
Yes.

341
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:34,439
Please do not tell him
that you and I have met in the past.

342
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,693
If my mother hears about it,

343
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,404
she will be heartbroken
by the things I went through.

344
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,116
Please do not tell him.

345
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:48,661
Everyone who knew her has been killed.

346
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:50,663
Did she spare me on purpose?

347
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:56,503
Jin Mu does not know
that we know that girl's true identity.

348
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,296
It will be a great weakness.

349
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:02,425
He must have killed them all
just to hide her identity.

350
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:05,261
She will face the same fate eventually.

351
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:08,640
If the Queen is planning
to shift souls with her,

352
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,618
they brought her here to be killed.

353
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:13,311
She has no idea
and is doing everything she can.

354
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:15,063
He is using her.

355
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:18,233
Just like how he used Naksu.

356
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:24,155
So-i is a pitiful girl as well.

357
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:27,784
Young Master.

358
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,619
Did you know

359
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:32,038
this umbrella fails
to fulfill its purpose?

360
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:37,293
Look here. It is already torn.

361
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:40,046
You are right.

362
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:42,441
I was told to pay a large sum
as it is a high-quality umbrella.

363
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:44,259
You must have been fooled.

364
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:52,016
I am quite gullible.

365
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,185
Is that so?

366
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,686
The soul shifter, Master Kang,
has disappeared?

367
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:40,231
After feeding on her energy,
he walked out on his own.

368
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,234
We could not find him
anywhere in Sejukwon.

369
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:46,362
Since the Unanimous Assembly
was held near the Training Center,

370
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:47,655
I doubt he went there.

371
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,657
Things have been disorderly all day long.

372
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,451
We should have spotted him.

373
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:54,787
There is one place he could hide

374
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:56,831
without being seen.

375
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:01,377
Inside the barrier of Jeongjingak.

376
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:04,422
He could be there.

377
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:43,628
A soul shifter.

378
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:48,007
I am with Jin Mu.

379
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:54,097
I know you.

380
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:56,784
I saw you shift souls
in the Cheonbugwan Secret Room.

381
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,102
Your soul shifted out of that old body.

382
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,991
We are on the same side. Please spare me.

383
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,412
I need human energy this instant.

384
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,122
I will find someone for you.

385
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:20,999
Would you not prefer feeding

386
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:23,584
on a Jeongjingak mage's energy
instead of mine?

387
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,753
Wait here,

388
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,797
and I will lure someone in.

389
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,592
- A mage of Jeongjingak?
- Yes.

390
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,344
Due to a barrier,

391
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,722
no one can leave
or enter Jeongjingak right now.

392
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,099
A barrier?

393
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:55,033
Young Lady Jin?

394
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:57,285
What are you doing there?

395
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:59,287
I was looking for something,

396
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,914
but then I lost the umbrella
that I use for walking.

397
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:04,917
There it is.

398
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,538
I will spare you.

399
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:45,124
Go bring more mages.

400
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:46,793
Yes, right.

401
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:51,964
Is Seo Yul here

402
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:54,217
in Jeongjingak as well?

403
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:57,886
Why do you ask?

404
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:02,934
He cut me with his sword.

405
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,103
He shall be the first person I kill.

406
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:07,605
He is

407
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:09,649
not here.

408
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,487
If you refuse,

409
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,532
I will kill you first.

410
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:18,616
I will obey.

411
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:22,745
There is someone here
that I would like to get rid of.

412
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:25,832
I will bring her here first.

413
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,001
Please kill her.

414
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:45,184
Your snacks are not tasty.

415
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:46,477
Even the noodles were bad.

416
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,772
Since I have yet to tell Jang Uk,

417
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:52,108
I will be Mu-deok for a bit longer.

418
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,694
I am sorry.

419
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:57,864
Dang-gu stashed away our leader's liquor.

420
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:06,956
How does it taste?

421
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:09,792
It is not bad.

422
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,044
I wonder what they are doing outside

423
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:14,672
- that they still have not resolved this.
- But still,

424
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:18,217
we are surrounded by flowers,
the weather is wonderful,

425
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:20,970
and it is full of energy.
This is not that bad either.

426
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,055
Your Royal Highness.

427
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,891
Watching flowers will bore you.

428
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,934
Would you like to watch me
perform Hyeongong?

429
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,146
He has some fancy techniques.

430
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:31,272
Is that so?

431
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:33,191
I will take a look.

432
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:34,942
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

433
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:21,906
What?

434
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:23,783
- Beom!
- Beom.

435
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,410
Beom, wake up.

436
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:27,703
- Hey!
- Hey.

437
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:29,914
Let us carry him. Beom.

438
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:34,543
Your energy drained out
when you cast spells?

439
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:35,461
Yes.

440
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:37,755
I felt my energy draining out.

441
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:38,923
It felt like

442
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:42,301
my energy was draining out
like a broken vase.

443
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:44,720
I examined his core of energy,

444
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:46,555
and he has lost a lot of energy.

445
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,869
How could I lose my torrent of energy?

446
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:01,862
Maybe this sword is the problem.

447
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:22,174
My energy just drained from the sword.

448
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:24,760
I think the barrier
is causing the problem.

449
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,764
I think it takes the energy you use…

450
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,518
when you cast spells.

451
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:48,326
We cannot use spells

452
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:50,036
or unsheathe our swords in here.

453
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,413
Let us keep our swords here.

454
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,632
This is Naksu's sword
that Master Lee had taken from me.

455
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,301
Did you have it?

456
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:07,970
Yes, Your Royal Highness.
He wanted me to keep it safe.

457
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:09,847
But Maidservant Kim
did not want it at home.

458
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,349
So I had kept it here.

459
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,865
Keep this with you

460
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:29,617
and give it to him once he comes.

461
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:34,163
I cannot leave the house
when I was entrusted with this.

462
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:36,499
Maidservant Kim.

463
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:38,876
So tell me.

464
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:41,420
Did the Unanimous Assembly go smoothly?

465
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:42,838
Not at all.

466
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:46,175
All the mages from different families
are headed to Songrim.

467
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:49,053
Something must have come up.

468
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:53,933
He will have to show himself
with all the fuss going around.

469
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,984
Will Gwanju Jang Gang really return?

470
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,136
Who are you to come here?

471
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:34,432
Gwanju.

472
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:43,649
Who is Assistant Gwanju's right hand
at the moment?

473
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:11,760
Cho Chung threatened to expose
the truth about Young Master Jang.

474
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:15,097
I had no choice
but to teach him the alchemy of souls.

475
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:19,101
Since he has run wild and died,
is this not the end?

476
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:23,272
I only did what I did
for you and your son.

477
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:27,943
I have lost my closest friend
as well as my wife to sorcery.

478
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,280
I will get rid
of all remaining Soul Ejectors

479
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:34,158
and seal the ice stone
in Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.

480
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:35,910
No.

481
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:39,497
After all that you have done to master it.

482
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,457
How could you let go of the ice stone?

483
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,666
You cannot do that.

484
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,295
Since you also learned
the alchemy of souls,

485
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:49,965
I will destroy your energy flow
so you cannot perform sorcery.

486
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:51,467
Destroy my energy flow?

487
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:54,178
No, my lord.

488
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:04,021
Please do not destroy my energy flow.

489
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:07,274
I swear I will never perform
the alchemy of souls

490
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:11,111
which you have taught me. I promise!

491
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:32,841
I should have destroyed his energy flow.

492
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:38,347
Instead of hiding the ice stone,
I should have come clean

493
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:40,849
and destroyed the ice stone.

494
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:45,896
How did he retrieve the ice stone

495
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:49,233
from Lake Gyeongcheondaeho?

496
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:51,902
Or did someone help him?

497
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:25,436
I feel the same.

498
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:29,565
But there is only one thing
that makes me different.

499
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:32,192
It is that…

500
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:35,946
I am a soul shifter.

501
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:40,659
Hey, Beom.

502
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:42,911
You can always train again.

503
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:46,165
He is right. You will be fine.

504
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:47,458
Cheer up.

505
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:50,628
The ice stone is draining their energy.

506
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:53,672
If I shift souls
and take the stone's energy,

507
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:56,925
will I be taking their energy as well?

508
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:00,012
Earn one, and lose the other.

509
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:02,848
That is the burden you will have to carry.

510
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:05,726
If I want to regain my power,

511
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:10,147
I will have to take their energy as well.

512
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,440
And if I do that,

513
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:14,485
they will die.

514
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:27,206
I will have to take responsibility

515
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:30,042
for their deaths.

516
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:36,548
Filthy Mu-deok, what are you doing here?

517
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:44,348
He will die as well.

518
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,475
It is dangerous here.

519
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:48,602
If someone like you touches the barrier,

520
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,646
your bones could get crushed.

521
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:52,231
Step back.

522
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:58,112
Are you not going to thank me?

523
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:02,241
I was showing my concern for you.

524
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:07,329
You had lost your energy back there.

525
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:09,540
Are you all right?

526
00:45:11,708 --> 00:45:14,169
Is this how you are thanking me?
Worrying about me too?

527
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:16,380
Not a bad idea.

528
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:19,258
I am fine.

529
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:21,593
I am sorry.

530
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:22,928
For what?

531
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:26,515
For making terrible noodles and snacks.

532
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:28,725
You could not eat anything.

533
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:35,941
Please have some of this instead.

534
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:41,989
Honey biscuits, Jang Uk's favorite.

535
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:44,867
Are you sharing some
that you had gotten for him?

536
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:47,453
Forget it. You can have them.

537
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:52,374
Look. I know I should take them.

538
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:57,671
But I have decided
to give them to you instead. All of those.

539
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:02,259
I have given them to you.

540
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:06,889
He may not be the nicest man,
but he has been very considerate.

541
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:11,351
Take this.

542
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:13,562
I want to thank you
from the bottom of my heart.

543
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:16,899
- Your heart?
- Yes, Your Royal Highness.

544
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:18,942
I mean it.

545
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:22,237
I am always grateful.

546
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:29,286
If you want to thank me sincerely,

547
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:33,332
give me something bigger than that.

548
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:36,335
I would prefer something grander.

549
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:44,927
Just take this.

550
00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:48,347
This is just the right amount.

551
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:54,144
You are unbelievable.

552
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:59,149
You are always impertinent
and barge your way in.

553
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:02,528
But whenever I reach for you,
you always back away.

554
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:08,450
The reason why I am not persistent
in trying to hold on to you

555
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:11,495
is that if you still refuse, I would…

556
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:19,545
Forget it. I will not accept
if it is only that amount.

557
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:35,769
I would have felt
less terrible had he taken it.

558
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:40,899
Fine.

559
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:44,152
I do not have to feel entirely guilty.

560
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:09,468
Mu-deok.

561
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:13,640
I have a favor to ask of you.

562
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:16,602
Can you go to the mages' quarters for me?

563
00:48:17,894 --> 00:48:19,062
What for?

564
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:22,149
It is humid here.
Could you bring me a new blanket?

565
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:24,651
I heard you can get it there.

566
00:48:38,832 --> 00:48:40,042
Yes, Young Lady.

567
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:01,855
What are you doing?

568
00:49:01,938 --> 00:49:04,066
Trying to keep
the fire in the brazier alive.

569
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:24,002
Darn it.

570
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,213
Really?

571
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:28,048
Are you a moron?

572
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:31,927
Wait.

573
00:49:35,013 --> 00:49:37,808
Did you just call me a moron?

574
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:39,559
There are countless books here.

575
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,228
You could have burned them all.

576
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:43,271
I could have cast a spell to control it.

577
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:44,773
I was simply flustered…

578
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:47,317
as I cannot do it right now.

579
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:50,779
Still, you could have
just closed the lid on it.

580
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:52,572
They say you are a genius.

581
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:54,574
But you do not know
what to do when flustered.

582
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:57,035
- You are just a fool.
- Do not bad-mouth me.

583
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,662
I will get upset.

584
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:02,082
So you do know how to be upset.

585
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:05,544
You were always so placid like water.

586
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:08,797
Even water can boil or freeze.

587
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,174
It does not always stay the same.

588
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:21,852
It is humid due to the fog.

589
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:24,479
Were you doing this
because your leg was hurting?

590
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:29,401
You remembered.

591
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,028
I am fine.

592
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:33,280
Do not worry.

593
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:39,661
You said you liked pine pollen tea snacks.

594
00:50:41,663 --> 00:50:43,165
But I never got to give you any.

595
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:45,709
You remembered that as well.

596
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:49,087
What is the point?

597
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:51,548
I never got you any.

598
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:54,676
Then make some for me next time.

599
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,306
There is no next time.

600
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:03,518
If I shift souls, he will die as well.

601
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:04,478
Better yet,

602
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:06,855
teach me the recipe.

603
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:09,900
Then I can make it myself. Like last time.

604
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:11,860
Do you remember?

605
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:20,243
I cherish

606
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,121
all the memories I had in Danhyanggok.

607
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:35,759
Seo Yul will die.

608
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:43,600
I was on my way to the quarters
for some blankets.

609
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:45,060
I will get going then.

610
00:51:53,151 --> 00:51:56,071
Let me do that. Go to Uk.

611
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:07,332
He has been looking for you.

612
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:21,638
I just need to be Naksu again.

613
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:25,183
I had cut ties with him back then.

614
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:28,979
I will do the same with everyone.

615
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:45,120
Glaring at it will not break the barrier.

616
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:52,794
Did you see that?

617
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:55,213
The stone passed through.

618
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:57,090
You are right.

619
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:00,218
Maybe only things
that have liquid cannot pass.

620
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:01,803
What a strange barrier.

621
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:04,764
It filters what can and cannot pass.

622
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:06,308
What kind of barrier is that?

623
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,685
What are the others doing outside?

624
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:12,522
Despite all the mages out there,
they have yet to break this barrier.

625
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,692
Is it because the ice stone made it?

626
00:53:15,775 --> 00:53:19,613
They are probably too busy
fighting over who gets the ice stone.

627
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:22,824
Still, they know
that I am trapped in here.

628
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:29,205
Perhaps you are not that important
to the Queen who has the ice stone.

629
00:53:30,665 --> 00:53:32,125
How could a mother be like that?

630
00:53:33,126 --> 00:53:35,045
Or is she similar to my father?

631
00:53:37,213 --> 00:53:38,715
Fine.

632
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:42,469
As you all know,
she is not my biological mother.

633
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:45,472
Just like you and your father.

634
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:49,142
That is what everyone says.

635
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:51,895
I will not apologize even if you are hurt.

636
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:54,481
Then I will not beat around the bush.

637
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:58,902
If the Queen and Jin Mu
offer the power of the ice stone to you,

638
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:00,362
can you still get rid of them?

639
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:07,661
It would be difficult
to decline such grand power.

640
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:09,829
You are brave.

641
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:13,959
You need the courage
to be open about your greed.

642
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:21,800
And you? What will you do
if you had the ice stone?

643
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:27,180
I will do what Master Seo Gyeong did.

644
00:54:27,263 --> 00:54:28,431
Seo Gyeong?

645
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:32,777
Do you mean you wish to become
a hero with the fate of the King's Star

646
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:34,830
by destroying every ice stone
and saving the world from chaos?

647
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:38,441
I am sure he did
such a thing out of sincerity.

648
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:42,862
But I believe he saved one stone
to save someone he loved

649
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:45,115
out of sincerity as well.

650
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:48,076
You see, that part touches me more.

651
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:53,915
So that is what he wrote in his book.

652
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:57,293
It is just a poor excuse
for not being able to let go of the stone.

653
00:54:58,086 --> 00:54:59,379
Who would believe that?

654
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:00,839
I do.

655
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:05,468
Because I would do the same.

656
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:24,195
What?

657
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:26,072
Stones pass through the barrier.

658
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:28,616
Send a notice to urge them
to come to your rescue.

659
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:32,828
Jang Uk.

660
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:35,248
You are a genius.

661
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:40,336
Let me see.

662
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:45,842
- A barrier…
- Uk.

663
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:48,428
Is there a bigger stone?

664
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:50,305
They just need to read your message.

665
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:52,098
You do not need a bigger one.

666
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:53,683
I need to write in big letters.

667
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:56,561
Does this one not budge?

668
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:00,690
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

669
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:04,277
By the way, why did Dang-gu never tell us

670
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,863
about his stash of liquor?

671
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:09,282
We should drink it all. Drink up.

672
00:56:09,365 --> 00:56:11,785
- Let us drink.
- Let us drink.

673
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:17,874
I brought another brazier.

674
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:21,461
Mu-deok.

675
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:23,838
Why are you here?

676
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:25,006
What do you mean?

677
00:56:27,008 --> 00:56:29,594
Young Master Seo went
to get the blankets himself.

678
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:34,641
Is Seo Yul here in Jeongjingak as well?

679
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:36,601
He shall be the first person I kill.

680
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:09,592
Young Master Seo,
you cannot enter this room.

681
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:13,179
- What is the matter?
- Please go back.

682
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:17,308
Can you see me?

683
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:19,435
You see, I…

684
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:51,926
Young Master Seo!

685
00:58:22,373 --> 00:58:23,583
Young Master Seo!

686
00:58:25,543 --> 00:58:28,755
Young Master Seo! What do I do?

687
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:48,358
What do I do?

688
00:59:12,423 --> 00:59:13,675
What?

689
00:59:13,758 --> 00:59:15,843
Who are you?

690
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:45,915
Yul!

691
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:46,999
Yul.

692
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:55,675
- Young Master Seo!
- Are you all right?

693
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:28,583
Yul.

694
01:00:30,251 --> 01:00:32,045
- What happened?
- A soul shifter.

695
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:33,296
There is a soul shifter.

696
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:34,631
What?

697
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:39,469
A soul shifter is here.

698
01:00:39,552 --> 01:00:42,180
He fed on Yun-su and Jin-ho's energy.

699
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:00,990
Master Kang of Daegangtongun,
a very powerful man, is the soul shifter.

700
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:04,410
And he was using his energy
to cast spells.

701
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:06,746
None of us could use spells in here.

702
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:08,831
So why can he?

703
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:11,292
This place drains our energy,

704
01:01:11,376 --> 01:01:12,856
but it must be the opposite for them.

705
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:17,632
What if I regained my power

706
01:01:18,257 --> 01:01:20,426
and took the ice stone with me?

707
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:23,846
If caught, you may even be killed for it.

708
01:01:25,306 --> 01:01:26,516
Are you not afraid?

709
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:28,685
I am still a bit afraid.

710
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:31,270
I am scared that you may break our promise

711
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:33,189
and abandon me without even looking back.

712
01:01:35,608 --> 01:01:37,902
- Jang Uk, I...
- Young Master Jang.

713
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:45,326
Where is Mu-deok?

714
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:47,704
She was with us up until a while ago.

715
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:49,580
Where did she go?

716
01:01:56,295 --> 01:01:58,172
There was a nuisance roaming around.

717
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:10,977
If he is not stopped,
they will all die in there.

718
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:15,898
They are going to die
once I shift souls anyway.

719
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:17,900
It would be ridiculous to save them.

720
01:02:19,026 --> 01:02:20,903
This is how I will cut ties with them.

721
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,952
I just feel too guilty.

722
01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:31,289
This will be the last time I save them.

723
01:02:32,206 --> 01:02:33,374
Just this once.

724
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:36,919
You.

725
01:02:38,212 --> 01:02:40,923
- Where have you been?
- I am here, am I not?

726
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:42,508
Uk…

727
01:02:43,134 --> 01:02:44,343
Jang Uk could die!

728
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:07,575
No one can beat him here right now.

729
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:09,911
We cannot all die.

730
01:03:09,994 --> 01:03:12,455
I will lure and trap him
in the secret room.

731
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:19,128
Once he traps the soul shifter
and himself in the secret room,

732
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:20,546
Uk will die.

733
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:22,173
Why?

734
01:03:22,924 --> 01:03:24,509
Why did he go alone?

735
01:03:25,426 --> 01:03:27,804
He said he had to.

736
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:29,305
He said he was responsible.

737
01:03:36,687 --> 01:03:39,273
- Where are you going?
- To the secret room.

738
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:42,652
If the door to the secret room is open,

739
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,614
that means Uk died after failing
to lure the soul shifter there.

740
01:03:46,697 --> 01:03:48,199
If it is closed,

741
01:03:49,116 --> 01:03:50,743
he is probably already dead.

742
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:52,703
There is no use.

743
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:57,875
You said you would not be persistent
in trying to hold on to me.

744
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:00,586
You cannot stop me.

745
01:04:01,587 --> 01:04:02,964
So please let me go.

746
01:05:01,606 --> 01:05:05,192
If it is closed,
he is probably already dead.

747
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:13,075
But I can never turn back time
even if I regret something.

748
01:05:14,535 --> 01:05:15,745
Jang Uk.

749
01:08:09,627 --> 01:08:11,045
You are still alive,

750
01:08:13,214 --> 01:08:14,632
my pupil.

751
01:08:33,818 --> 01:08:35,444
Why did you hide it?

752
01:08:39,698 --> 01:08:40,825
Because…

753
01:08:42,827 --> 01:08:44,078
I wanted you to die.

754
01:08:45,871 --> 01:08:47,039
Then…

755
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:49,583
why did you come for me?

756
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:54,046
Because…

757
01:08:58,259 --> 01:08:59,760
I thought you would die.

758
01:09:06,433 --> 01:09:08,185
Since you have unsheathed the sword,

759
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:10,896
make your decision.

760
01:09:13,858 --> 01:09:15,609
I know you have been avoiding me.

761
01:09:15,693 --> 01:09:18,320
I also know that everyone's lives
are in your hands.

762
01:09:22,741 --> 01:09:24,076
Like you promised,

763
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:26,745
point your sword at me first.

764
01:09:41,135 --> 01:09:42,178
If you stab me,

765
01:09:42,887 --> 01:09:45,472
then I will die as the one

766
01:09:46,223 --> 01:09:47,600
who released the assassin.

767
01:09:49,768 --> 01:09:51,061
If you withdraw your sword,

768
01:09:51,896 --> 01:09:53,898
I will make you another promise.

769
01:10:17,296 --> 01:10:18,422
Fine.

770
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:24,762
Make me another promise

771
01:10:26,347 --> 01:10:28,182
just like you said you would.

772
01:11:41,505 --> 01:11:44,800
What human would choose
to give up on such immense power?

773
01:11:44,883 --> 01:11:47,177
To protect what we must…

774
01:11:47,261 --> 01:11:48,679
What if I give it all away?

775
01:11:48,762 --> 01:11:50,556
I am trying to protect as well.

776
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:53,142
Why is he here?

777
01:11:53,225 --> 01:11:55,728
Jin Bu-yeon's immense divine powers

778
01:11:55,811 --> 01:11:57,956
not only came from her mother,
a member of the Jin family.

779
01:11:57,980 --> 01:12:01,275
Park Jin! You hid the truth,
despite knowing everything.

780
01:12:03,193 --> 01:12:07,698
Then those leaving shall leave,
and those returning shall return.

781
01:12:07,781 --> 01:12:10,367
Young Master. Do what you must.

782
01:12:10,451 --> 01:12:13,620
I will be trying something
not out of stupidity, but out of vigor.

783
01:12:13,704 --> 01:12:15,205
Just as my master has taught me.

784
01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:17,624
- I look quite nice.
- Goodness.

785
01:12:17,708 --> 01:12:20,044
I heard there was a bride
about to get married soon.

786
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:27,760
