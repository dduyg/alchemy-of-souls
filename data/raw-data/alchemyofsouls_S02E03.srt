00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:44,961
ALCHEMY OF SOULS
PART 2

2
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,800
We are married.

3
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,386
Please give us your blessings.

4
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,388
Nonsense. I did not allow this marriage.

5
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:59,309
Jang Uk, I will never allow you
to take my daughter.

6
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,269
I am not asking for your permission.

7
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,146
Like I said,

8
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,398
we are already married.

9
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,360
Bu-yeon.

10
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:12,530
Answer me.

11
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:14,364
This cannot be, right?

12
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,117
My kindhearted daughter

13
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:19,162
could not have possibly deceived me
and married that man.

14
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,331
Am I right?

15
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,667
I will never abandon you, Mother.

16
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:27,253
Yes. Right.

17
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:29,589
You are so precious to me.

18
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,466
However,

19
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:36,429
I cannot live the life you want for me.

20
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:39,766
That is why I married him.

21
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:41,975
And from now on,

22
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,188
we will be together.

23
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,523
I do not believe you.

24
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:50,610
He is holding my daughter hostage
and forcing her to lie.

25
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:52,821
This wedding is a lie.

26
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:55,907
Are you all going to sit back
and watch this nonsense?

27
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:15,467
Jang Uk.

28
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:19,097
You vowed never to abuse your power

29
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:22,642
on the life of Park Jin,
the former leader of Songrim.

30
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:25,228
How dare you wed the heiress of Jinyowon

31
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:26,646
without Jinyowon's consent?

32
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,898
Leave her here and go.

33
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:30,733
If not,

34
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:34,195
Park Jin will pay
for all the deeds you have committed.

35
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,281
I did not use any of my powers.

36
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,993
Are you so terrified
that you would use him to threaten me?

37
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,412
Terrified?

38
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:47,917
You must have nothing to fear
due to those powers of yours.

39
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,586
But this is the Unanimous Assembly.

40
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,629
We are not fearful of you.

41
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:52,713
In that case,

42
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,008
watch closely

43
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,511
as I take her away from here.

44
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,734
I thought being
the acting leader was enough.

45
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:15,570
So why must I come here
on my uncle's behalf as well?

46
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:17,780
We must hurry.
The Unanimous Assembly must have begun.

47
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:18,864
Right.

48
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,153
I heard you were the acting leader.

49
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,753
So you are attending
the Unanimous Assembly as well.

50
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,967
I did not know you would be here.

51
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,221
I heard that your sister was found

52
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:42,972
and she will be introduced as the heir.

53
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:46,517
I heard you posted her portrait
throughout Daeho Fortress.

54
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:49,062
It was nothing.

55
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:50,647
Your sister was missing.

56
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,774
That was the least I could do.

57
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:55,026
Why did you do that
when no one asked you to?

58
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:59,197
Now that her face has been revealed,
she will be locked up forever.

59
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,659
Poor thing.

60
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:05,745
Locked up?

61
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,924
Something must have happened
at the Unanimous Assembly.

62
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,313
He has incredible skills.

63
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,397
Did you see that?

64
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,918
He unleashed such power
when he did not even unsheathe his sword.

65
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,777
The ice stone has the energy of the sky.

66
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:40,488
If Jang Uk wants to,

67
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:42,865
he could take all of our souls
using his powers!

68
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:46,452
Still, we have here with us
some of Daeho's most powerful mages.

69
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,454
We will be a laughingstock
if we let him go!

70
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,498
Please calm down.

71
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:56,672
One party does not believe
that they are married,

72
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:59,048
and the other party claims that they are.

73
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,134
I have an idea.

74
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:03,970
Bring forth a witness
who can verify your marriage.

75
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:06,723
Why is a witness necessary?

76
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,559
Because no one believes you.

77
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:12,061
Bring forth a witness,

78
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,622
and we will let you go with our blessings.

79
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,023
But if you do not,

80
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:18,609
you are not justified
to take Jinyowon's heiress with you,

81
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:19,861
and you must leave alone.

82
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:24,449
I see that you are still
hung up on justifications.

83
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,129
If my powers can be
considered justification,

84
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:32,789
I would like

85
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,376
to see you try arguing with that.

86
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:39,838
Gosh.

87
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:45,219
I guess you cannot prove it.

88
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:49,557
I can.

89
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:09,367
And we have

90
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:11,787
a witness.

91
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:23,924
Right here.

92
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,945
She is with child?

93
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:45,696
Do you not consider

94
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,949
this baby to be the best witness

95
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:50,618
to our wedding?

96
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:51,911
How can we believe you?

97
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:52,994
Right.

98
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,164
We have a physician here.

99
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,542
Master Heo, please take a look.

100
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:01,671
I can only tell
if at least 21 days have passed.

101
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:02,839
Uk.

102
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:06,092
When did you two become intimate?

103
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,263
Why would you ask such a thing?

104
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:11,931
How embarrassing.

105
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:13,558
We need to be sure.

106
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:16,519
Lady Jin.

107
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:20,106
Seeing how they are close,

108
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:22,316
should you not give them your permission?

109
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:25,820
Marriage is a family affair.

110
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:29,073
The Unanimous Assembly does not
need to talk further about this.

111
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,700
Let us put an end to this.

112
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:31,909
End it.

113
00:07:58,728 --> 00:07:59,812
Hey, Uk.

114
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,105
You were here too?

115
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,693
Bu-yeon.

116
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:06,903
Why are you leaving?

117
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,821
I am married to him.

118
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,199
So I will be moving in

119
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,492
with my husband.

120
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:13,575
Your husband?

121
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:17,413
I told you before that I was waiting
for my groom to take me away.

122
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,834
He came, and I am leaving with him.

123
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,928
So he was the one

124
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,223
who got her out of that room.

125
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,352
Did your sister just say

126
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:42,230
that she got married to Uk?

127
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,359
I see.

128
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:56,410
If Jang Uk has become
Lady Jin's son-in-law,

129
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:59,830
I do not see the need
to move Jinyowon to another family.

130
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,332
I agree.

131
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:02,708
It is Jang Uk, after all.

132
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,877
No one would dare to attack Jinyowon.

133
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:05,962
Ho-gyeong.

134
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:10,550
You have put on quite a show
introducing Bu-yeon to everyone.

135
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:15,263
In any case,
Jinyowon will remain safe and strong

136
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,974
thanks to your great son-in-law.

137
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,070
Young Master, welcome home.

138
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:32,654
Hey.

139
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:35,324
You are back again, my lady.

140
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,702
Yes, I am.

141
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,289
Young Master.

142
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,374
Where did you go without telling me?

143
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,253
- And why are you...
- Maidservant Kim.

144
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,755
She must be exhausted today as well,

145
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,757
so please prepare her a room.

146
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,764
Today, you have dressed appropriately
as a member of the Jin family.

147
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:02,268
I attended the Unanimous Assembly.

148
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:03,394
The Unanimous Assembly?

149
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,983
Is that where our young master
picked you up?

150
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,485
Yes.

151
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:14,155
But this time,
I will be settling here for good.

152
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,366
I hope we get along, Maidservant Kim.

153
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,243
Right.

154
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,665
So the person
Bu-yeon gave her heart to was Uk.

155
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:25,750
Does this mean

156
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,544
the two were dating?

157
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,212
When did they first meet?

158
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,006
It must have been that day

159
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:34,342
when Uk entered Jinyowon.

160
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:38,763
Was that already 21 days ago?

161
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,932
- Twenty-one days?
- It is a long story.

162
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:44,852
Could that be true too?

163
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,487
-But Dang-gu,
-What?

164
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,197
Do you really believe it?

165
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,283
That Uk finally let go of Mu-deok…

166
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,245
and fell in love with someone else?

167
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,626
Of course not.

168
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,503
That is absurd.

169
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,965
I am sure there is a reason for all this.

170
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:20,637
But what could it be?

171
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:41,951
You are a relic of Jinyowon, right?

172
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:46,163
Thanks to you, I was able to get married.

173
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,376
Wait…

174
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,507
Did I really turn you off?

175
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,091
Or…

176
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,428
did Uk turn you off

177
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:02,513
so he could take me away?

178
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,685
Of course not.

179
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,190
If I could turn it off,
then could I turn it back on again?

180
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,303
This is his sword.

181
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:45,598
How pretty.

182
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,531
What is going on?

183
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:06,785
That lantern.

184
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,205
Did you turn it on?

185
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,042
Was it you?

186
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,128
I was the only one here…

187
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:18,964
so probably.

188
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:21,425
Why are you not sure?

189
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:25,471
Something just flashed before my eyes.

190
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:26,889
I think it was a memory.

191
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,976
It must be true that regaining my memories
will bring back my powers.

192
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,438
Do it again.

193
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,496
See? I did that.

194
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:51,872
Well done.

195
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,833
I could not recover my memories until now
since I was locked up.

196
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,001
Look.

197
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:59,505
Now that there are external stimuli,
it is all coming back to me.

198
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:03,175
This way, you can continue
regaining your memories and divine powers.

199
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,044
I am glad I brought you here.

200
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,222
Thank goodness.

201
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:12,309
I was worried because you seemed mad.

202
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:15,229
That was because
you made up a fake witness.

203
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:19,441
Was it not because of my mother?

204
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:22,357
Was it because of the baby?

205
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,781
We got out of there safely
thanks to our baby.

206
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:29,243
I already expected your mother
to react that way.

207
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:30,870
As for the baby...

208
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,836
You are making it seem like
you are actually pregnant.

209
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,088
What do we do now?

210
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:42,964
That physician, Heo Yeom,

211
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,593
wants to check up on me
after the twenty-first day.

212
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:47,469
I cannot tell him the truth.

213
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,554
Then what?

214
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,180
Do you want us to make a baby by then?

215
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,321
Why? What is it?

216
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:13,704
I was hoping

217
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:15,663
for this.

218
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:18,918
I hoped you were the one
who turned off the lantern

219
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,794
and I hoped that you would come for me…

220
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,257
despite being of no use to you.

221
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,929
Even if I did turn it off,

222
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,923
it would not be
due to the reasons you were hoping for.

223
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,308
You know that.

224
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,733
So what are you going to do?

225
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:46,028
If you want, I can help you create
that witness you must bring

226
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,947
to Sejukwon by the twenty-first day.

227
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,784
That is, if you give up
on that futile hope of yours.

228
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:25,109
Let us say this was
how we created our witness.

229
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,236
We are married, after all.

230
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,947
I cannot say I did it alone.

231
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:32,949
You said you would help.

232
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:35,744
Do not resent me for this.

233
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,081
Will you keep lying about a witness?

234
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,836
What is it now?

235
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:45,838
Stop being unpredictable.

236
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,555
- What is it?
- Do not mind me.

237
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,482
- What is this?
- My mother sewed the tracking thread

238
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:07,567
into my flesh.

239
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,738
It is tightening and causing me pain.

240
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:12,865
She must be…

241
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,493
calling for me.

242
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,639
I cannot let you stay with him.

243
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:39,891
Come back,

244
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,144
my dear daughter, Bu-yeon.

245
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,412
Regardless of the circumstances,

246
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,290
how could a mother sew
such a thing onto her daughter?

247
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:05,375
I cannot believe this.

248
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:09,421
Goodness, you must be feeling
excruciating pain.

249
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,174
How about you return to Jinyowon for now?

250
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,551
I will tell our young master
to escort you.

251
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,596
Do not do that.

252
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,015
I said I would endure the pain.

253
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,559
Please do not send me away.

254
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:25,145
How could you possibly endure such pain?

255
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,108
It is brazen to desire something

256
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,027
without being willing

257
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,030
to endure the pain.

258
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,494
A pain that does not kill me

259
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:42,703
will eventually…

260
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,292
set me free.

261
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,097
Young Master.

262
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,224
Young Lady Bu-yeon is in a lot of pain.

263
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,307
So?

264
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:04,726
Does she want to return?

265
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,270
No, she vehemently refuses.

266
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:09,523
I applied some ointment for the pain,
but it is not helping.

267
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,278
She said she would endure it.

268
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,315
Just give her more ointment.

269
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,494
I thought she was his wife.

270
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:24,454
Why is he being so cold to her?

271
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,006
Mother.

272
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,507
Please stop.

273
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,471
It is too painful.

274
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:17,299
Her face was
shockingly identical to Naksu's,

275
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,843
but her build and aura
were completely different.

276
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:23,847
Naksu was neither that dainty nor small.

277
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:27,809
I need to find out more about Jin Bu-yeon.

278
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,689
- So-i should be coming for her medicine.
- Yes, my lord.

279
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,861
I will use her.

280
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,740
- Here we go.
- Let me see.

281
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,200
- One more.
- Really?

282
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:45,577
- I got it!
- Darn it.

283
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,413
- Here you go.
- Where is it?

284
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:51,291
Wait here. Goodness.

285
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:56,755
Ninety-three.

286
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:58,674
Ninety-four.

287
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,343
Ninety-five.

288
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,804
Ninety-six.

289
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,306
Ninety-seven.

290
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:08,600
Ninety-eight.

291
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:11,061
Ninety-nine.

292
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:12,604
One hundred.

293
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:15,399
Sang-gu, are you all right?

294
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:16,858
What do I do?

295
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,111
Do you want to save your brother?

296
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:22,239
Then pay me back.

297
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,994
You sold your farmland.
Give me the money you got.

298
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,955
I do not have any. I already used it all.

299
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,038
Is that so?

300
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,333
I will count to 200 this time.

301
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,669
Try hard to remember where the money is.

302
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:37,713
Dunk him.

303
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,881
Sang-gu!

304
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,258
Two.

305
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:42,718
- Three.
- Sang-gu!

306
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,012
- Madam.
- Four.

307
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:46,887
Five.

308
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:49,598
Six.

309
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:52,519
Seven.

310
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:55,730
Eight.

311
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:58,983
Nine.

312
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:01,653
Ten.

313
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,338
Bu-yeon.

314
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,425
Why are you making me hurt you?

315
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:25,301
Come back.

316
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:42,694
What have you done?

317
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:47,115
My wife cannot sleep.

318
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:51,578
Please refrain from calling her
in the middle of the night.

319
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:52,788
As you already know,

320
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:55,957
we are newlyweds.

321
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:13,326
There is no pain anymore.

322
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:18,748
Mother must have stopped.

323
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:27,507
In return for the medicine,

324
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:31,705
he wants you to bring her to him.

325
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,181
Jin Bu-yeon?

326
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,433
Lady Jin's daughter?

327
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:40,979
Is it really her?

328
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:42,105
That is not important.

329
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:44,816
Just follow the Gwanju's orders.

330
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:48,737
You are alive to this day
despite the blood parasite in you

331
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,072
only because of his medicine.

332
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,245
And I am showing my gratitude
by doing everything he wants.

333
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:00,207
I will take her to that room
in Cheonbugwan.

334
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:14,822
Have you told the person
who has been giving me this medicine

335
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:17,224
that I wanted to see them?

336
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:20,143
They said there was no need for that
and refused.

337
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:24,689
But I do know who they are
and what they do.

338
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,067
Is her name So-i?

339
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,237
So you two have met.

340
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:34,908
She is the owner
of a notorious gambling den.

341
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:38,078
Rumor has it she does illegal business,
and Cheonbugwan has her back.

342
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:42,540
I felt extremely uneasy
knowing that I was giving you medicine

343
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,626
from a woman like her.

344
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,087
Where is this gambling den?

345
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,505
It is in Gaema Village.

346
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:52,926
Are you taking that medicine
because you are ill?

347
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:56,137
Are you staying here instead of at Songrim
to hide your illness?

348
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:57,721
That is not true.

349
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:01,685
I feel more comfortable here.
You do not need to worry about me.

350
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:10,943
Young Master.

351
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,488
Did you go somewhere?

352
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:15,865
Why are you still up, Maidservant Kim?

353
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:17,867
How can I sleep in this situation?

354
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:21,871
Would you rather watch me lose sleep
and explain everything tomorrow?

355
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:23,622
Well…

356
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,001
Maidservant Kim.

357
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:31,328
I am sorry for getting married abruptly.
I should have asked for your permission.

358
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:34,134
In that case,
you should have a proper wedding ceremony.

359
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:35,657
Before then, I will not consider her

360
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,220
to be the lady of the house.

361
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,848
I will continue calling you "young master"
instead of "my lord."

362
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,435
All right, then. Prepare for a wedding.

363
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,023
Do you mean that?

364
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:52,360
Not mine, but yours.

365
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:55,530
- Young Master.
- I am already married.

366
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:58,658
So you can get married to him as well.

367
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:01,244
You can do that.

368
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:02,912
What will you do

369
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:05,081
after I get married?

370
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,250
She and I will get what we desire.

371
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:10,253
She was locked up
and hidden from everyone.

372
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:12,672
Now, she will be free.

373
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,299
As will I.

374
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:18,136
Can I interpret that
as you trying your best

375
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:20,513
to let go of the past?

376
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:25,684
In that case,

377
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:30,440
I will say what I have kept to myself
for the past three years.

378
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:37,697
Please get rid of
the red bird egg that you keep

379
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,159
where you have been stabbed.

380
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:46,414
Why do you keep the yin-and-yang jade
you shared with the dead?

381
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:47,707
That jade

382
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:50,293
brings two people to each other.

383
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:53,462
I am terrified

384
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:56,800
that the dead girl will come

385
00:27:58,259 --> 00:27:59,552
to take you away.

386
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:16,610
Do not worry.

387
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,028
She has never

388
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:20,990
called me with this.

389
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:25,120
She is dead.

390
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:28,373
The egg that you nurtured
with great care hatched

391
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,667
into an atrocious bird of prey.

392
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:36,131
And it gravely wounded you before it died.

393
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:37,215
So please

394
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:39,634
destroy it.

395
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:42,720
The reason why I still have this is

396
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:46,474
so that I will know
that she really is dead.

397
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,895
I can only believe
that she will never come back

398
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,441
if I can see it with my own eyes.

399
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:57,985
Because…

400
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,322
I did not witness her death.

401
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:14,753
Who are they talking about?

402
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:16,628
A bird egg?

403
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:28,308
I can finally sleep in peace
since the pain is gone.

404
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:36,733
Should I tell him
that I am no longer in pain?

405
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:38,943
He could be worried about me.

406
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,472
He does not worry about me.

407
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:25,489
Young Lady Bu-yeon.

408
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:28,868
They are like family to Young Master Jang.

409
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:32,789
I am Jin Bu-yeon,
the eldest daughter of the Jin family.

410
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:34,706
It is nice to meet you.

411
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:40,171
Is it really true
that you and Uk are married?

412
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,048
That is why she is here.

413
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:46,135
Since you are married,
let me congratulate you.

414
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:48,012
They are not married yet.

415
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,014
We will have a formal wedding ceremony.

416
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:53,017
Until then, she is still
the eldest daughter of Jinyowon

417
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,478
and Young Master Jang's betrothed.

418
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:58,648
Seeing how you are still his betrothed,

419
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:00,692
you must not be with child after all.

420
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:02,861
I am sorry.

421
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:05,029
I lied to prevent a fight from occurring.

422
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:06,906
You are very daring.

423
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:13,246
Have I ever treated you before?

424
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:14,914
You seem familiar.

425
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,249
I doubt it.

426
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:20,461
I was treated
by the best physician in Daeho Fortress.

427
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:22,422
I am the best physician here.

428
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:24,507
Who else could it be? Tell me their name.

429
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:27,051
Master Heo, please stop.

430
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,095
She never left Jinyowon.

431
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:32,223
From what I heard,
she suffers from memory loss.

432
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:34,976
Memory loss?

433
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:39,314
I was seriously ill,
and I have no recollection of the past.

434
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:40,440
However,

435
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:44,027
I still have the ability to see energy
as I did as a child.

436
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:49,032
I see some impressive energy
within you two.

437
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:54,203
You are of the few mages
with exceptionally strong powers.

438
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:57,040
Anyone could sense that.

439
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:59,125
As for you,

440
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,502
your energy may not be impressive.

441
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:04,213
But it is pure and bright.

442
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:06,758
Anyone can see
that Dang-gu has a good personality.

443
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:09,302
That cannot be considered a special power.

444
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:11,554
You have a similar energy
to my sister, Cho-yeon.

445
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,598
They are both pure and light.

446
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:17,018
I believe Cho-yeon has told you
about me, right?

447
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:21,022
Are you seeing Cho-yeon again?

448
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,399
- No.
- No.

449
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,736
- We just met to discuss Bu-yeon.
- Dang-gu.

450
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:28,154
- Did you meet her?
- Pardon?

451
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:29,906
Yes.

452
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:34,410
And I have been sensing
two people's energy back there.

453
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:36,329
Do not be absurd.

454
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:38,957
Come out if you are back there!

455
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:49,550
Young Lady Heo.

456
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:50,969
What are you doing there?

457
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:05,483
Then what did you see in Uk?

458
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:07,944
He had the energy of the sky.

459
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:09,695
That is right.

460
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:13,282
Uk had died and was only revived

461
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,159
thanks to that energy.

462
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:19,288
I heard.

463
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:22,792
Since I can see his energy,

464
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:25,128
I promise to stay by his side
and protect him.

465
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,968
What do you think about her?

466
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:35,346
I do believe that she is a priestess
with unique powers.

467
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,307
I believe she got married
to our young master

468
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:39,892
to avoid becoming an heiress.

469
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,479
And our young master

470
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:46,733
wants to get married for my sake.

471
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:49,777
For your sake?

472
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:52,238
He said I do not need
to worry about him anymore.

473
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:54,949
He is encouraging me to get married.

474
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:00,371
You understood that, right?

475
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:10,506
I am always prepared
to welcome you with open arms.

476
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:24,020
But your heart still seems to be troubled.

477
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,898
You do not need to rush.

478
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:29,817
I will not pull you toward me
if you are not ready.

479
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:34,489
But your heart is racing, my lord.

480
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,324
Despite what I just said,

481
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:41,370
How can I possibly hide
even my longing for you?

482
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:52,172
I…

483
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,342
Have desires too.

484
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:07,897
Master Heo does not seem
to like Young Lady Bu-yeon very much.

485
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,900
He was disapproving
and said she looked familiar.

486
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:13,528
To be honest,
she seemed familiar to me as well.

487
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,780
I believe I have seen her before.

488
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:17,698
How fascinating.

489
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,368
You recognized it at first glance.

490
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:23,329
Right? I have seen her before.

491
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:24,412
That is right.

492
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,813
That dress belonged to Madam Do-hwa.

493
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:30,419
She often wore it before she got married.

494
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:31,503
That is right.

495
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:34,882
No wonder she seemed familiar.

496
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,677
After seeing Do-hwa in that dress,

497
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,512
I wrote a poem for her.

498
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,438
They do say
that first love is unforgettable.

499
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:51,149
Even a slow-witted person like you

500
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:53,067
recognized her dress at first glance.

501
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,232
- Your heart must have fluttered.
- That is not true.

502
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,867
This heart is racing right now
because of you.

503
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:01,950
Forget it.

504
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:10,001
Listen carefully.

505
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,171
Can you not hear my heart?

506
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:17,799
I know.

507
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:20,303
I was just joking.

508
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:21,929
You can let me go.

509
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,894
I am finally embracing you,

510
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,646
so how could
I possibly let go that easily?

511
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,623
You do not need to walk me home.

512
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,047
I may have lost my memory,
but I am not stupid.

513
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,669
Please do not misunderstand.

514
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:56,047
She only said it out of concern for you.

515
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,591
She has a hard time believing
that you are married to Uk.

516
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:00,968
To be honest,
I find it hard to believe as well.

517
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,513
She asked me to check on you.

518
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:06,390
She could not defend me

519
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,559
out of fear of our mother.

520
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:11,187
But she is pure and kindhearted.

521
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,651
Has your wound
from the tracking thread healed?

522
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:20,112
She is glad that it will not hurt anymore.

523
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:24,283
Did Cho-yeon hide the thread somewhere?

524
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,202
Without my mother's knowing?

525
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:30,623
So that is why it stopped hurting.

526
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:31,706
Pardon?

527
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:36,629
You must not know
about last night's incident.

528
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,880
What do you mean?

529
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,258
The thread is gone.

530
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:44,512
Uk broke into Jinyowon last night
and destroyed it.

531
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:51,309
Jinyowon was in chaos

532
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:54,480
because of him.

533
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:56,899
Were you really not aware of it?

534
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:58,859
I was not.

535
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:00,986
He just told me…

536
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:04,490
to endure the pain.

537
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:25,052
Uk spends most of the day
in the Dark Forest,

538
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:29,598
which gets its name
from the dense cypress trees.

539
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:36,564
You will see stone towers
deep in the forest.

540
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:40,026
Every time he kills a soul shifter,
he builds one.

541
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,278
It is like a graveyard.

542
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:47,158
People are too scared
to even go near them.

543
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,786
He seems to prefer that

544
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:52,830
as he is often there.

545
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,234
I was told he would be here.

546
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:23,527
But he is not.

547
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:27,114
Are these the soul shifters' graves?

548
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:41,462
One of the graves

549
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:44,048
belongs to Naksu.

550
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,802
She will end up finding it.

551
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:57,469
You must have killed
the infamous soul shifter as well.

552
00:39:58,562 --> 00:39:59,562
She died.

553
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:02,858
That soul shifter's grave

554
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:05,945
must be here as well.

555
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:13,244
- They are bird's eggs.
- We can have one each.

556
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,789
I pick red. You can have the blue one.

557
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,968
I did not even touch the tower.

558
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,720
But why did it collapse?

559
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:02,835
This is not just any stone.

560
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:11,343
I saw this stone in my memory back there.

561
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,512
Did I see it in Jinyowon?

562
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:15,848
Did I see it as a child?

563
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:24,982
Who could she be?

564
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:28,235
Jin Bu-yeon is Mu-deok,
and Mu-deok is already dead.

565
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:37,244
If this came from Jinyowon,

566
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:39,997
should I ask Cho-yeon about it?

567
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,467
Hey! Stop right there!

568
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:55,429
Stop!

569
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,264
- Goodness.
- Goodness.

570
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,641
Gosh.

571
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:02,186
- I am sorry.
- Watch where you are going.

572
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:03,896
I am sorry.

573
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:14,698
Lure her toward Cheonbugwan's back door.

574
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,617
Yeom-su will be waiting there.

575
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,701
Yes, my lady.

576
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:21,497
Once So-i lures Jin Bu-yeon,
I will bring her here.

577
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:31,882
Once I read her mind
with this soul incense,

578
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:37,096
I will know for sure
if she really is Jin Bu-yeon.

579
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:57,198
That is strange.

580
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,952
The stone's energy
is in the other direction.

581
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:20,389
How did she know to follow me here?

582
00:43:57,551 --> 00:44:00,095
Seeing how you are hiding,
you must know that I was tailing you.

583
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:14,193
You must be wondering
how I knew to follow you.

584
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:16,779
I can see energy.

585
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:19,865
I can see yours even when you are hiding.

586
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:22,451
And I can see this stone's energy too.

587
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:45,807
I sense bad energy.

588
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:49,061
I should not inhale this.

589
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:52,981
She can see energy?

590
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:56,318
That is Jin Bu-yeon's divine power.

591
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:59,613
I should wait until she falls unconscious,

592
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:02,116
then take her to Cheonbugwan.

593
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:04,910
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

594
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:09,790
I am here to see the owner.

595
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:13,252
Go to the last room on that side.

596
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:28,058
There you are, Madam.

597
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:29,935
Someone is looking for you.

598
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:01,299
I smell soporifics.

599
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:21,445
Jin Bu-yeon?

600
00:46:25,782 --> 00:46:27,034
Why are you here?

601
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:30,078
I was chasing a pickpocket.

602
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:31,622
Why are you here?

603
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:33,582
I am here to see someone.

604
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:39,254
Darn it.

605
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:48,054
Darn it.

606
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:51,849
You can hold onto me.

607
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:55,062
Then you will get wet too.

608
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:58,482
- That is fine.
- Thank you.

609
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:14,831
Hold on.

610
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:26,301
I stayed underwater
after smelling the soporifics.

611
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,347
I almost drowned.

612
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:43,442
Cover yourself.

613
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:44,860
But I am not cold.

614
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:51,743
I must have been mortifying to look at.

615
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,958
Thank you once again.

616
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:03,046
Should I help you catch the thief?

617
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,756
I retrieved my property.

618
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,009
I do not want to cause a scene,
so I will leave.

619
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:10,178
Go on and meet whomever you came here for.

620
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:13,140
It is not urgent, so let me walk with you.

621
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:16,602
This is a dangerous neighborhood
to walk alone in.

622
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:22,858
This is Gaema Village.

623
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:26,320
Many fortune-telling shamans live here.

624
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:29,906
There are also those who practice sorcery.

625
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:34,036
That must be
why it feels so dark and cold here.

626
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:37,205
You should ask Uk to accompany you
to dangerous places like this.

627
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:39,583
Do you know Jang Uk...

628
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:41,668
I mean, do you know my husband?

629
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:45,672
Dang-gu, Uk, and I are childhood friends.

630
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,966
- I see.
- For the past three years,

631
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:50,510
I was in Seoho Fortress, my hometown,
but I recently returned.

632
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:52,095
I have already met Dang-gu.

633
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:54,431
He had bright energy.

634
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:57,809
As for you…

635
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:10,530
I envy you for having childhood friends.

636
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:14,034
By the way,

637
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:18,455
I think we have been circling
the same path.

638
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:24,920
I lose my sense of direction
when I am flustered.

639
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:26,046
I apologize.

640
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:30,384
I think it is that way.

641
00:49:33,595 --> 00:49:34,835
We already went down that path.

642
00:49:36,973 --> 00:49:38,058
Let us go that way.

643
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:43,480
I have now become familiar
with these paths.

644
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:44,564
So follow me.

645
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:53,573
It is my fault that we went in circles.

646
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:54,491
I am sorry.

647
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:55,867
That is fine.

648
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:58,412
There is nothing wrong
with being airheaded

649
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:01,474
- as long as you are handsome.
- I was simply flustered.

650
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:02,999
I am not airheaded.

651
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:04,834
All right.

652
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,045
I do not think you understand.

653
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:12,926
I was always the top pupil
during my training in Jeongjingak.

654
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:14,553
I have mastered all the books,

655
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:16,763
so people always ask me for help.

656
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:18,347
That is who I am.

657
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:20,434
I see.

658
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:22,853
So you are smart?

659
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:25,939
That is a pity.

660
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:30,694
As you can see,

661
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:33,488
my beauty is unmatched.

662
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:36,450
But I am not the brightest.

663
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:42,247
You also seemed like a fool
despite your good looks.

664
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:43,665
So I felt a sense of kinship.

665
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:46,793
It is a shame that you are smart.

666
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:49,546
In that case,

667
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:53,592
I can deem myself a fool
so we can be two foolish friends.

668
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:56,719
Thank you.

669
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:03,518
I am asking because I do not know.

670
00:51:04,936 --> 00:51:07,606
Was there a soul shifter
who could see despite having been blind?

671
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:10,692
She had blue marks in her eyes,

672
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:12,819
and Uk saw them from up close.

673
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:15,113
Do you know who she was?

674
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:18,950
I believe you are talking about Naksu.

675
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:20,452
Naksu?

676
00:51:21,703 --> 00:51:22,871
I heard she died.

677
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:25,122
Correct.

678
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:27,918
And Uk died by her hands as well.

679
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:29,710
I see.

680
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:34,883
She was his enemy.

681
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:40,847
You must not have known about this.

682
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:43,308
I did not.

683
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:48,939
I should be careful not to mention
her name in front of him.

684
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:55,111
Thank you for letting me know.

685
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:16,591
She could see energy?

686
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:20,303
Then she really is Jin Bu-yeon.

687
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:22,429
Did you not say

688
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:25,642
that you threw her into a lake
when she was a girl?

689
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:28,103
Are you worried
that people will find out about that?

690
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:31,940
It was her dead father who threw her in.

691
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:36,486
That blind girl did not know
that I was there as well.

692
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:39,197
Thanks to Jin U-tak
being murdered by Naksu,

693
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:41,807
everything was swept under the rug.

694
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:43,994
And that is why you are still alive.

695
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:48,373
You were a swindler who killed many.

696
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:52,502
You even put a blood parasite inside you
and pretended to be their fake child.

697
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:54,629
And yet, I turned you

698
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:58,216
into an innocent victim
who was controlled by Jin U-tak.

699
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:01,343
That is right.

700
00:53:02,178 --> 00:53:03,722
I am forever indebted to you.

701
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,809
I know you do not mean that.

702
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:10,645
But as long as
that parasite lives within you,

703
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:12,606
you will never be able to leave me.

704
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:14,691
Because without my medicine,

705
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:18,904
you will writhe in pain
as your insides melt, and you will die.

706
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:23,116
Anyway, both of us
and my secret organization

707
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:26,620
were able to get out alive
thanks to Naksu.

708
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:29,456
However, I cannot believe
how much she resembles her.

709
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:32,792
What do you mean?

710
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:35,879
Bu-yeon is the spitting image of Naksu.

711
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:38,465
That was why I was wary of her.

712
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:42,260
Seeing how that girl
does indeed have divine powers,

713
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:46,556
she must not be a fake daughter
like you were.

714
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,807
So that woman truly is…

715
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:50,977
Jin Bu-yeon.

716
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:01,464
I heard there was a drought.

717
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:04,032
But these flowers are still fresh.

718
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:06,159
I remembered the flowers you used to love.

719
00:54:06,242 --> 00:54:08,411
I searched throughout Daeho Fortress
to find them.

720
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:10,514
They are full of energy
since Lake Gyeongcheondaeho's water

721
00:54:10,538 --> 00:54:11,998
flows within them.

722
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:22,759
My former body

723
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:25,428
was just like this flower.

724
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:27,472
The flower is full of moisture.

725
00:54:27,555 --> 00:54:29,683
It is very fresh and beautiful.

726
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:32,644
The flowers outside
have shriveled up due to lack of energy.

727
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:34,354
They do not emit a scent either.

728
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:37,440
Shriveled up due to lack of energy?

729
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:40,652
They are just like me.

730
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,619
All you have to do is water these flowers

731
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:51,871
to make them look fresh!

732
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:56,001
But no matter how much energy I consume,

733
00:54:56,084 --> 00:54:58,628
I am still shriveling up!

734
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:03,133
You want me to petrify and die

735
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:06,219
in this body that is not mine.

736
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:10,098
How dare you mock me?

737
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:16,104
I am sorry, Your Highness!
Please spare me!

738
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:17,856
You are

739
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:20,483
young and fresh.

740
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:29,242
Would you like to switch bodies with me?

741
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:34,080
Why would you want
to switch bodies with a mere court lady?

742
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:37,333
You are our noble Queen.

743
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:50,263
He is a close cousin of mine
from Seoho Fortress.

744
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:52,974
He was to marry into the Jin family.

745
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:57,353
I heard about the Unanimous Assembly.

746
00:55:57,437 --> 00:56:00,398
So Jang Uk became
Jin Ho-gyeong's son-in-law?

747
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:01,566
Because of that,

748
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:05,236
it has become more difficult
to take Jinyowon

749
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:07,572
from the Jin family.

750
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:11,177
Then what about the rite for the lake?

751
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,162
You said we needed Jinyowon's relic

752
00:56:14,245 --> 00:56:16,456
to get the ice stone from the sky.

753
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:24,297
How will we open Jinyowon's doors
if that man is there?

754
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:27,300
We will have to remove
the priestess from his side.

755
00:56:27,383 --> 00:56:28,593
But they are married.

756
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:30,178
Who will acknowledge that

757
00:56:30,261 --> 00:56:31,781
when they did not even have a wedding?

758
00:56:31,846 --> 00:56:33,098
In addition,

759
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:36,684
everyone in Daeho knows
that he was betrothed to someone else.

760
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:42,107
Naksu?

761
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:44,734
The third anniversary of her death
is around the corner.

762
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:47,320
I shall summon Naksu's soul once again

763
00:56:47,403 --> 00:56:49,906
to distract Jang Uk.

764
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:52,241
After that,

765
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:58,540
Jin Bu-yeon will get married
to her former betrothed.

766
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:09,592
None of the mages
at the Unanimous Assembly

767
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:12,011
could stop Jang Uk
from leaving with that priestess.

768
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:14,931
Is he truly more powerful
than all the mages there?

769
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:17,267
They let him go
because he said they were married.

770
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:18,350
Goodness.

771
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:20,603
They always have their excuses.

772
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:23,815
I heard that Jin Bu-yeon
has some great divine powers.

773
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:25,778
Did he marry her
because he needed those powers?

774
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:28,027
Her portrait was posted throughout Daeho.

775
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:29,471
Apparently, she is a great beauty.

776
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:31,114
Because of her looks?

777
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:33,199
I know Jang Uk pretty well.

778
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:35,034
He would only seduce a woman to use her,

779
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:36,661
not because he fell for her looks.

780
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:52,760
Did they fight?

781
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:54,804
Something must have happened

782
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:56,448
between the Queen and her court ladies.

783
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:00,351
Since His Majesty is avoiding her,

784
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:03,021
she is venting her anger at the innocent.

785
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:05,398
To be honest, there is a lot of gossip

786
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:08,318
about the powder
the Queen has given to the concubines.

787
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:10,027
Powder…

788
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:12,614
as in cosmetics? Why?

789
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:14,782
They think it is cursed

790
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:17,535
with sorcery that dries out their skin.

791
00:58:21,706 --> 00:58:23,458
Go and retrieve all that powder

792
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,461
and find out where the Queen got it from.

793
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:28,630
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

794
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:37,514
Look at these pretty shoes.

795
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:39,807
You are so beautiful.
Please have a look around.

796
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:42,018
Here. They suit you.

797
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:44,103
I bet they will look great on you.

798
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:47,148
You are pretty.
Gosh, then come again next time.

799
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:52,779
That looks delicious.

800
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:03,873
I apologize.

801
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:17,637
Is there something you are looking for?

802
00:59:19,764 --> 00:59:22,141
I heard you sold powder
to the royal palace.

803
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:23,351
Powder?

804
00:59:28,147 --> 00:59:29,357
I am a eunuch.

805
00:59:30,775 --> 00:59:32,902
She must have sent you.

806
00:59:33,444 --> 00:59:34,988
This way, please.

807
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:47,512
Goodness. Are you interested in the rouge?

808
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:50,795
Try it on yourself.
It has a beautiful color.

809
00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:53,131
There is no need.
I am just looking at them.

810
00:59:54,507 --> 00:59:56,551
This is not just any rouge.

811
00:59:56,634 --> 00:59:58,845
This rouge has the power

812
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:02,390
to sway the men around you.

813
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:05,809
Is that true?

814
01:00:06,477 --> 01:00:08,646
Do you have a lover
that you want to attract?

815
01:00:10,815 --> 01:00:12,191
I have a husband.

816
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:22,410
This rouge is quite distinct.

817
01:00:22,493 --> 01:00:25,872
All of our products are one of a kind.

818
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:27,540
Look.

819
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:29,834
That eunuch was sent
from the royal palace.

820
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:34,172
Even the royal palace buys our products.

821
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:36,257
I guess you did not know.

822
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:37,800
I sense ominous energy.

823
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:43,765
The energy here is similar
to that of Gaema Village.

824
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:47,435
Are you also a shaman from there?

825
01:00:47,518 --> 01:00:49,937
Many shamans buy our products.

826
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:51,813
I do not need them.

827
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:58,488
Are you selling this turtle too?

828
01:00:58,571 --> 01:01:01,783
It is not for sale.
It is an ingredient used for our products.

829
01:01:01,866 --> 01:01:03,034
An ingredient?

830
01:01:03,117 --> 01:01:06,162
There are many uses for its shell.

831
01:01:06,245 --> 01:01:09,624
It is quite expensive and rare to find.
You should not touch it.

832
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:12,210
- Ok-sim!
- Coming.

833
01:01:12,293 --> 01:01:14,796
An ingredient? You poor thing.

834
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:21,260
Eunuch, do you have some money?

835
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:25,723
Me?

836
01:01:26,432 --> 01:01:29,060
- Were you referring to me?
- If you do, buy this turtle.

837
01:01:29,977 --> 01:01:31,562
It has good energy.

838
01:01:31,646 --> 01:01:33,106
It will bring you luck.

839
01:01:34,982 --> 01:01:37,110
Do shamans read
turtles' physiognomy as well?

840
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:38,486
Why would I take it with me?

841
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:42,198
It will be killed if it stays here.
That would be a pity.

842
01:01:42,281 --> 01:01:44,659
Forget it. You should purchase it, not me.

843
01:01:44,742 --> 01:01:46,369
I have no money right now.

844
01:01:46,452 --> 01:01:49,914
And I am living at someone else's place,
so I cannot be that shameless.

845
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:53,083
Look.

846
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:57,004
It is stretching its neck to look at you.
Will you just let it die?

847
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:03,594
All turtles look like that.

848
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:05,930
It is not doing that just to look at me.

849
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:08,850
Raise it yourself.

850
01:02:08,933 --> 01:02:09,933
Since…

851
01:02:10,435 --> 01:02:12,520
you cannot have any children as a eunuch.

852
01:02:13,604 --> 01:02:15,148
It will be worth it.

853
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:17,024
Children?

854
01:02:19,026 --> 01:02:20,153
Hey, shaman.

855
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:22,697
You have poor skills,
and that is why you make no money.

856
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:25,100
Do I look like someone
who would raise a turtle as his own?

857
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:28,202
I cannot see one's physiognomy,
but I can see their energy.

858
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:30,246
You may talk coldly,

859
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:34,083
but your warm heart wants
to save this turtle.

860
01:02:37,962 --> 01:02:39,505
You have rare energy.

861
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:42,103
It must be because you live at the palace.

862
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:45,678
That is right. I am…

863
01:02:47,638 --> 01:02:48,806
Go from the royal palace.

864
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:57,231
Then, Eunuch Go,
please take good care of the turtle.

865
01:03:06,365 --> 01:03:07,992
I pretty much revealed to her

866
01:03:08,075 --> 01:03:09,994
that I was a part of the royal family.

867
01:03:11,078 --> 01:03:12,663
How could she not know that?

868
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:14,207
Is she a fool?

869
01:03:18,377 --> 01:03:19,420
Your Royal Highness.

870
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:21,714
I found the powder.

871
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:30,014
The well suddenly dried up
in a matter of days.

872
01:03:30,097 --> 01:03:32,767
We asked Cheonbugwan to look into it,

873
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:34,936
but they have not done anything so far.

874
01:03:35,019 --> 01:03:36,896
The drought may have been ongoing,

875
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:39,398
but a well could not
have dried up so quickly.

876
01:03:42,568 --> 01:03:44,153
Why did you bring him here?

877
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:47,323
You should have brought
a powerful mage instead.

878
01:03:47,406 --> 01:03:50,451
He said he would look into it
if I paid for his food.

879
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:52,375
- Who knew he would be incompetent?
- Goodness.

880
01:04:15,434 --> 01:04:17,353
Goodness. The well is filling up again!

881
01:04:17,436 --> 01:04:18,980
What a relief!

882
01:04:19,063 --> 01:04:21,065
Goodness! Thank you!

883
01:04:21,148 --> 01:04:22,233
He is incredible.

884
01:04:22,316 --> 01:04:25,236
I have found five of these
in every well so far.

885
01:04:25,319 --> 01:04:27,488
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

886
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:29,365
Who in the world is doing this?

887
01:04:29,448 --> 01:04:31,158
This is a relief.

888
01:04:33,619 --> 01:04:35,913
Noodles and celebrations go hand in hand.

889
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:40,292
You fool.

890
01:04:40,334 --> 01:04:42,461
Had you had a proper wedding,

891
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:45,882
I would have served this dish
to everyone in Songrim.

892
01:05:03,107 --> 01:05:05,651
No. You better not
serve this dish to anyone.

893
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:08,055
If you serve this on your wedding day
with Maidservant Kim,

894
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:10,071
I will be angry.

895
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:14,326
I heard from her.

896
01:05:18,289 --> 01:05:19,957
Did you think marrying her off to me

897
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:22,334
would help you

898
01:05:23,294 --> 01:05:25,671
die in peace?

899
01:05:30,718 --> 01:05:33,179
Your bride does not
seem to know about this.

900
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:34,847
Have you not told her yet?

901
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:36,682
She lacks her divine powers as of now.

902
01:05:37,308 --> 01:05:40,478
She needs to regain her memory to do that.

903
01:05:40,561 --> 01:05:41,561
I already confirmed it.

904
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:44,899
Then it will not happen anytime soon.

905
01:05:47,401 --> 01:05:48,401
Eat up.

906
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:54,992
These noodles will be the death of me.

907
01:05:55,076 --> 01:05:58,537
Is that so?
I followed the recipe used in the kitchen.

908
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:03,542
Apparently, Mu-deok used
to enjoy making those noodles.

909
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:08,214
I avoided mentioning
her name all this time

910
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:10,424
because I did not want to hurt you.

911
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:12,926
However,

912
01:06:13,844 --> 01:06:16,097
I think it failed instead.

913
01:06:20,601 --> 01:06:21,601
You did not visit

914
01:06:22,937 --> 01:06:25,147
the cliff where she met her demise,
did you?

915
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:29,402
Then why did you raise
that stone tower in the mountain?

916
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:31,320
Were you not mourning her death?

917
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:33,239
Were you praying she would come back?

918
01:06:38,452 --> 01:06:39,912
Sang-ho was the one…

919
01:06:41,914 --> 01:06:44,792
who witnessed her getting petrified

920
01:06:44,875 --> 01:06:47,503
and saw her fall
into Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.

921
01:06:49,046 --> 01:06:50,548
Let him recount the incident,

922
01:06:51,632 --> 01:06:52,675
see for yourself,

923
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:56,012
and then mourn for her.

924
01:06:56,887 --> 01:07:00,349
And if you still want to die after that…

925
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:06,021
come back here.

926
01:07:07,898 --> 01:07:09,275
I will make you

927
01:07:10,735 --> 01:07:12,111
another dish.

928
01:08:06,248 --> 01:08:07,333
He is not coming home.

929
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:17,718
Jang Uk.

930
01:08:18,677 --> 01:08:20,096
Goodness.

931
01:08:21,222 --> 01:08:23,432
Young Master Jang is often away

932
01:08:23,516 --> 01:08:25,434
for days on end
without telling us in advance.

933
01:08:26,227 --> 01:08:28,062
Do not wait for him and just go to bed.

934
01:08:50,042 --> 01:08:51,669
He is still not home.

935
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:53,420
When is he coming?

936
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:55,964
Gosh.

937
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:04,056
I wanted to thank him
for destroying the tracking thread.

938
01:09:11,772 --> 01:09:13,983
He will be delighted to hear…

939
01:09:16,318 --> 01:09:17,736
that I regained another memory.

940
01:09:40,718 --> 01:09:43,470
Wait there. I will go to you soon.

941
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:45,556
Make me another promise

942
01:09:46,765 --> 01:09:48,184
just like you said you would.

943
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:52,104
I will keep you by my side forever.

944
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:54,190
If you find yourself
in a life or death situation,

945
01:09:54,273 --> 01:09:56,275
give up on love and choose your life.

946
01:09:57,401 --> 01:09:58,761
That is an order from your master.

947
01:10:18,130 --> 01:10:19,381
Are you done, my lady?

948
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:30,434
Why is he not coming home?

949
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:32,603
My lady.

950
01:10:33,187 --> 01:10:34,939
You have been summoned to the study.

951
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:36,648
Is that so?

952
01:10:38,525 --> 01:10:40,027
How many days has it been?

953
01:10:40,861 --> 01:10:43,614
It is not the young master.

954
01:10:49,954 --> 01:10:50,954
It is not him.

955
01:10:53,332 --> 01:10:54,332
Young Lady Bu-yeon.

956
01:10:54,833 --> 01:10:57,211
Young Master Jang is at Jeongjingak.

957
01:10:58,504 --> 01:11:00,547
I guess you did not know that.

958
01:11:01,131 --> 01:11:02,424
You must be worried.

959
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:04,385
He has been staying there

960
01:11:04,468 --> 01:11:06,720
ever since you visited Songrim last time.

961
01:11:06,804 --> 01:11:09,223
That must mean you two have not met since.

962
01:11:09,306 --> 01:11:12,351
No one will be able to take care of him
since that place is empty.

963
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:14,478
So why is he there all by himself?

964
01:11:14,561 --> 01:11:16,361
Maybe someone makes him
uncomfortable at home.

965
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:23,112
Young Lady Bu-yeon.

966
01:11:23,195 --> 01:11:25,781
Let us bring some clothes for him.

967
01:11:25,864 --> 01:11:27,866
He is there because he feels comfortable.

968
01:11:28,492 --> 01:11:29,952
If you ever get to see him,

969
01:11:30,869 --> 01:11:33,372
please let him know

970
01:11:34,915 --> 01:11:36,500
that I am doing well here.

971
01:11:48,345 --> 01:11:51,390
Please give me anything that he may need,

972
01:11:51,473 --> 01:11:52,850
and I will deliver it to him.

973
01:11:52,933 --> 01:11:55,728
There is no need for me
to give anything to you.

974
01:11:56,687 --> 01:11:58,939
After all, Young Lady Bu-yeon
is betrothed to him.

975
01:12:00,649 --> 01:12:01,900
You do not need to worry

976
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:03,902
about him from now on.

977
01:12:07,031 --> 01:12:08,031
I understand.

978
01:12:12,119 --> 01:12:14,246
Why is he not coming home?

979
01:12:15,998 --> 01:12:17,958
Could it really be because of me?

980
01:12:18,042 --> 01:12:19,543
Let us go, my dear husband.

981
01:12:19,626 --> 01:12:21,438
I was telling you
to take off that impractical robe.

982
01:12:21,462 --> 01:12:23,088
Why in the world…

983
01:12:23,172 --> 01:12:26,050
If you drink that,
it means we are officially married.

984
01:12:27,092 --> 01:12:28,552
I do not wish to go back.

985
01:12:28,635 --> 01:12:31,305
I like it here. And I like you too.

986
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:37,978
He is uncomfortable
that I might throw myself at him.

987
01:12:39,104 --> 01:12:41,357
Darn it. He would not
be happy to see me then.

988
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:44,360
This way, you can continue
regaining your memories and divine powers.

989
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:45,944
I am glad I brought you here.

990
01:12:47,404 --> 01:12:49,448
He will be delighted if I tell him

991
01:12:50,157 --> 01:12:51,450
that I remembered something.

992
01:12:56,413 --> 01:12:57,413
Maidservant Kim.

993
01:12:58,999 --> 01:13:00,417
I must go see him.

994
01:13:01,502 --> 01:13:03,170
Please pack his things for me.

995
01:13:09,843 --> 01:13:10,843
Young Lady Heo.

996
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:12,805
Let me come with you.

997
01:13:13,972 --> 01:13:15,766
I miss him too much to just wait.

998
01:13:15,849 --> 01:13:17,810
He seems to be avoiding you.

999
01:13:17,893 --> 01:13:19,353
What if he does not welcome you?

1000
01:13:19,978 --> 01:13:22,064
I do not mind that.

1001
01:13:22,648 --> 01:13:26,610
I am simply going there
because I miss him.

1002
01:13:26,693 --> 01:13:30,030
And Sun-i, it seems like
you want him to feel that way about me.

1003
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:31,906
Why is that?

1004
01:13:33,367 --> 01:13:34,993
Is that what your young lady wants?

1005
01:13:36,995 --> 01:13:39,832
- She was the first to...
- There seems to be a misunderstanding.

1006
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:42,835
I am worried about you, not jealous.

1007
01:13:43,585 --> 01:13:47,256
I know he will not welcome either of us.

1008
01:13:49,758 --> 01:13:51,176
You think we are the same.

1009
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:53,137
Are you being humble or condescending?

1010
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:54,638
I am simply giving you advice.

1011
01:13:55,389 --> 01:13:57,057
But never mind if you do not get it.

1012
01:14:03,188 --> 01:14:05,482
What is that in your hand?

1013
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:09,278
Do you recognize this?

1014
01:14:09,361 --> 01:14:10,361
That is

1015
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:12,406
a yin-and-yang jade.

1016
01:14:12,489 --> 01:14:13,489
A yin-and-yang jade?

1017
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:16,535
There is a red one and a blue one.

1018
01:14:16,618 --> 01:14:18,954
They are drawn to each other's energy.

1019
01:14:20,497 --> 01:14:22,207
How is it that you have it?

1020
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:23,291
I picked it up.

1021
01:14:24,501 --> 01:14:26,741
I kept it after the stone tower
of the jade's owner fell.

1022
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:29,631
- But I will return it.
- What do you mean?

1023
01:14:29,715 --> 01:14:32,050
The owner of that blue jade is dead.

1024
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:34,720
The owner of that jade

1025
01:14:35,596 --> 01:14:37,991
is Naksu, the one who stabbed
Young Master Jang in the heart.

1026
01:14:38,015 --> 01:14:39,308
Naksu?

1027
01:14:41,018 --> 01:14:42,269
I have heard of her before.

1028
01:14:43,061 --> 01:14:44,188
She was his enemy.

1029
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:48,901
You really do not know anything.

1030
01:14:53,947 --> 01:14:56,241
Put energy into the jade and call for him.

1031
01:14:57,117 --> 01:14:58,494
Then you will understand

1032
01:14:58,577 --> 01:15:02,164
why no one believed
that you were his bride.

1033
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:04,916
See for yourself.

1034
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:40,553
So you know nothing about him,
yet you followed him here?

1035
01:15:40,577 --> 01:15:43,163
I never thought he would even consider
getting married again.

1036
01:15:43,247 --> 01:15:47,209
Is it really true
that you and Uk are married?

1037
01:15:47,292 --> 01:15:48,752
That is why she is here.

1038
01:15:48,835 --> 01:15:51,296
She has a hard time believing
that you are married to Uk.

1039
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:53,715
To be honest,
I find it hard to believe as well.

1040
01:15:53,799 --> 01:15:55,592
You must not have known about this.

1041
01:15:55,676 --> 01:15:58,887
Then you will understand why no one
believed that you were his bride.

1042
01:15:58,971 --> 01:16:00,013
See for yourself.

1043
01:16:07,104 --> 01:16:08,104
Young Master.

1044
01:16:08,772 --> 01:16:09,982
Did you just come home?

1045
01:16:10,065 --> 01:16:11,608
Yes, draw a bath for me.

1046
01:16:11,692 --> 01:16:13,277
What about Young Lady Bu-yeon?

1047
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:15,820
Did you not see her?

1048
01:16:16,363 --> 01:16:17,698
She went to see you,

1049
01:16:17,781 --> 01:16:19,992
so I hurriedly packed
some honey biscuits for her.

1050
01:16:21,994 --> 01:16:23,870
You must have missed each other.

1051
01:16:23,954 --> 01:16:27,457
She seemed to be worried
because she could not find you.

1052
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:40,429
She could be looking for you there.

1053
01:18:13,605 --> 01:18:15,315
I regained another memory,

1054
01:18:15,399 --> 01:18:17,192
and now I am able to do this.

1055
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:20,820
Was it you who called me?

1056
01:18:22,197 --> 01:18:23,824
Yes, I heard they were a set.

1057
01:18:30,664 --> 01:18:31,984
I was the one who called for you.

1058
01:18:32,791 --> 01:18:33,917
But you did not come…

1059
01:18:36,294 --> 01:18:37,295
for me, did you?

1060
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:43,051
Yes, I frantically rushed over here.

1061
01:18:44,344 --> 01:18:46,030
You better have
a good explanation for this.

1062
01:18:46,054 --> 01:18:47,889
What if I shared some good news

1063
01:18:49,099 --> 01:18:50,099
with you?

1064
01:18:54,438 --> 01:18:56,064
I regained another memory.

1065
01:19:00,152 --> 01:19:01,695
You and I…

1066
01:19:04,990 --> 01:19:06,510
have liked each other for a long time.

1067
01:19:51,077 --> 01:19:53,997
ALCHEMY OF SOULS
PART 2

1068
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:57,501
People were massacred on a boat
crossing Lake Gyeongcheondaeho,

1069
01:19:57,584 --> 01:19:59,002
and they say it was Naksu's doing.

1070
01:19:59,085 --> 01:20:01,505
The soul shifter that appeared this time
is Naksu.

1071
01:20:01,588 --> 01:20:04,174
If you are so worried,
I will catch her myself.

1072
01:20:04,257 --> 01:20:06,593
How can he get rid of something
that does not exist?

1073
01:20:06,676 --> 01:20:10,013
That ridiculous rumor
could end up killing your daughter.

1074
01:20:10,096 --> 01:20:12,599
By any chance, are you not feeling well?

1075
01:20:12,682 --> 01:20:14,142
What is inside my body?

1076
01:20:14,226 --> 01:20:16,728
I would like to hold a banquet
outside the palace walls.

1077
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:19,898
If Jin Bu-yeon gets attacked,
it will become Naksu's doing.

1078
01:20:19,981 --> 01:20:22,692
Then everything will become
Jang Uk's responsibility.

1079
01:20:24,736 --> 01:20:29,741
