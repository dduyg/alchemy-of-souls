1,16,1,00:00:35:18,00:00:37:07,What if I do not mind dying?
1,16,2,00:00:38:00,00:00:40:10,"Then can I hold onto it
and keep loving you?"
1,16,3,00:00:42:21,00:00:44:24,"I told you that
I am willing to risk it all"
1,16,4,00:00:45:24,00:00:47:19,and that we are in this together.
1,16,5,00:00:49:02,00:00:51:05,I will keep going no matter what.
1,16,6,00:00:51:07,00:00:55:19,"So you should do the same
and stick to your confession."
1,16,7,00:00:57:08,00:00:59:07,Keep loving me to death.
1,16,8,00:01:13:04,00:01:15:23,"Mu-deok, you should not glare like that."
1,16,9,00:01:16:00,00:01:19:06,"Nobody would believe your words
if you glare at me like that."
1,16,10,00:01:20:10,00:01:21:24,"Then tell me, Young Master."
1,16,11,00:01:22:01,00:01:26:00,"How should I look to convince people
that I love you to death?"
1,16,12,00:01:27:14,00:01:28:20,"Well, first of all…"
1,16,13,00:01:30:06,00:01:32:11,"Glaring at me like that
will definitely not do."
1,16,14,00:01:33:19,00:01:36:03,"They say one's eyes would be
brimming with sweetness."
1,16,15,00:01:38:13,00:01:39:19,I guess that is not possible.
1,16,16,00:01:40:24,00:01:42:23,So why did you say you love me to death?
1,16,17,00:01:43:00,00:01:46:07,"You should have said
you were mildly attracted to me instead."
1,16,18,00:01:47:23,00:01:50:08,"Say that I do my best
to look at you with sweetness"
1,16,19,00:01:50:10,00:01:52:13,and keep loving you to death.
1,16,20,00:01:52:15,00:01:54:17,What happens after that?
1,16,21,00:01:54:19,00:01:56:01,After?
1,16,22,00:01:56:03,00:01:59:00,Should I keep loving you blindly
1,16,23,00:01:59:02,00:02:01:22,"while Maidservant Kim
desperately tries to marry you off?"
1,16,24,00:02:02:24,00:02:06:04,What would happen to me then?
1,16,25,00:02:06:20,00:02:09:24,"Do not worry.
I have no intention of marrying for now."
1,16,26,00:02:10:02,00:02:11:18,"""No intention,"" my foot."
1,16,27,00:02:11:21,00:02:14:17,"Is that not why you refused
to drink chaste herb tea?"
1,16,28,00:02:17:01,00:02:20:05,So what you are asking me is
1,16,29,00:02:20:07,00:02:23:07,a promise of some sort?
1,16,30,00:02:23:09,00:02:25:06,"If I am to stay in love with you,"
1,16,31,00:02:26:10,00:02:28:20,I need to be certain that you are mine.
1,16,32,00:02:31:01,00:02:35:00,Let us not rush into things.
1,16,33,00:02:35:02,00:02:36:00,So you refuse.
1,16,34,00:02:37:23,00:02:40:20,Why is everything so dramatic with you?
1,16,35,00:02:40:22,00:02:43:11,"I am just saying that
we cannot rush things right now."
1,16,36,00:02:43:13,00:02:46:13,"I have to discuss it
with Maidservant Kim too."
1,16,37,00:02:46:15,00:02:47:15,Good grief.
1,16,38,00:02:48:13,00:02:49:09,Never mind then.
1,16,39,00:02:50:11,00:02:52:04,"""Eyes brimming with sweetness,"" my foot."
1,16,40,00:02:52:06,00:02:54:20,I will just glare at you like a dog.
1,16,41,00:02:54:23,00:02:56:00,A dog?
1,16,42,00:02:56:23,00:02:57:24,That is right.
1,16,43,00:02:58:01,00:03:01:12,I forgot to tell you something important.
1,16,44,00:03:02:03,00:03:03:23,It was that dog.
1,16,45,00:03:04:12,00:03:06:01,What are you talking about?
1,16,46,00:03:06:03,00:03:09:09,"The dog that was with Master Lee
at Danhyanggok. Do you remember?"
1,16,47,00:03:10:03,00:03:11:05,Sapsali?
1,16,48,00:03:11:07,00:03:12:16,Yes.
1,16,49,00:03:13:19,00:03:15:00,That dog was Gwigu.
1,16,50,00:03:18:01,00:03:22:16,"Master Lee knew that you were
a soul shifter from the beginning."
1,16,51,00:03:22:18,00:03:23:22,"Perhaps,"
1,16,52,00:03:24:20,00:03:26:15,he even knows you are Naksu.
1,16,53,00:03:40:04,00:03:43:19,"What brings the leader of Jinyowon
to Songrim at this hour?"
1,16,54,00:03:49:06,00:03:50:24,She must be here for you.
1,16,55,00:03:51:24,00:03:53:02,I heard that
1,16,56,00:03:53:04,00:03:56:16,"you took Gwigu, a relic of Jinyowon,
to the palace today."
1,16,57,00:03:56:18,00:03:59:13,"It was to find traces
of sorcery at the palace."
1,16,58,00:03:59:15,00:04:04:03,"I warned you not to get Jinyowon involved
in any more soul shifter cases."
1,16,59,00:04:04:05,00:04:06:09,Why is Songrim using Jinyowon at will?
1,16,60,00:04:08:16,00:04:10:14,Mage families under the Unanimous Assembly
1,16,61,00:04:10:16,00:04:12:08,must strive to stop sorcery.
1,16,62,00:04:12:10,00:04:16:05,"If Songrim is striving to do just that,
Jinyowon should offer their assistance."
1,16,63,00:04:16:19,00:04:18:11,Do you not think so?
1,16,64,00:04:18:13,00:04:21:12,So you mean you will use us again.
1,16,65,00:04:22:05,00:04:25:02,Then I will take Gwigu.
1,16,66,00:04:26:08,00:04:27:13,Hand it over to me.
1,16,67,00:04:28:07,00:04:31:24,Or should I look for it myself?
1,16,68,00:04:32:18,00:04:34:04,Gwigu is right here.
1,16,69,00:04:44:15,00:04:47:20,"Gwigu was a relic created
by Master Seo Gyeong."
1,16,70,00:04:47:22,00:04:49:12,"Therefore, it also belongs to Songrim."
1,16,71,00:04:49:14,00:04:51:21,"Why would Jinyowon's relic
also belong to Songrim?"
1,16,72,00:04:51:23,00:04:55:14,"Are you saying Jinyowon is
some kind of storehouse for Songrim?"
1,16,73,00:04:55:16,00:04:57:10,That is not what he meant.
1,16,74,00:04:57:12,00:05:01:02,"You boldly assume everything
in Jinyowon is yours to take."
1,16,75,00:05:01:04,00:05:03:13,"You take things without asking
and never return them."
1,16,76,00:05:04:03,00:05:05:23,"That must be
how the people of Songrim are."
1,16,77,00:05:08:09,00:05:12:01,You said something similar before.
1,16,78,00:05:13:19,00:05:17:24,"That a mage of Songrim had taken
something from Jinyowon."
1,16,79,00:05:25:12,00:05:26:23,Who was that mage?
1,16,80,00:05:38:03,00:05:40:22,He is right before my eyes.
1,16,81,00:05:41:24,00:05:44:14,The one who snuck into Jinyowon
1,16,82,00:05:44:16,00:05:46:08,and stole Gwigu.
1,16,83,00:05:47:10,00:05:51:18,How dare you call Master Lee a thief!
1,16,84,00:05:51:20,00:05:54:17,What else do you call someone who steals?
1,16,85,00:05:55:08,00:05:57:17,"Mother, please."
1,16,86,00:05:57:19,00:06:01:21,"It was Master Lee who moved Gwigu
from the broken pottery"
1,16,87,00:06:01:23,00:06:03:16,into the body of that dog.
1,16,88,00:06:03:18,00:06:05:14,It was Songrim that broke the pottery.
1,16,89,00:06:05:16,00:06:06:20,How dare you!
1,16,90,00:07:08:13,00:07:10:06,"It is dead, Master."
1,16,91,00:07:14:03,00:07:15:18,I was protecting my daughter.
1,16,92,00:07:15:20,00:07:19:04,"Master Lee, did you command
Gwigu to attack us?"
1,16,93,00:07:19:06,00:07:21:21,Gwigu attacked because it sensed sorcery.
1,16,94,00:07:25:24,00:07:27:07,Then that means
1,16,95,00:07:29:03,00:07:31:02,that the young lady had traces of sorcery.
1,16,96,00:07:39:07,00:07:42:00,"It must have sensed the sorcery
of the worm that sucked her blood."
1,16,97,00:07:48:24,00:07:50:01,Young Lady Jin.
1,16,98,00:07:51:00,00:07:52:03,Have you ever
1,16,99,00:07:52:23,00:07:54:15,used sorcery?
1,16,100,00:08:00:20,00:08:03:00,Sorcery? That is preposterous!
1,16,101,00:08:03:02,00:08:04:08,"If not,"
1,16,102,00:08:04:11,00:08:06:19,why would Gwigu have attacked her?
1,16,103,00:08:07:09,00:08:10:10,"Songrim must be trying
to frame my daughter."
1,16,104,00:08:10:12,00:08:11:24,Please stop!
1,16,105,00:08:12:16,00:08:14:10,Master Lee is right.
1,16,106,00:08:17:24,00:08:19:05,"A while ago,"
1,16,107,00:08:19:24,00:08:23:13,I did use sorcery.
1,16,108,00:08:29:15,00:08:33:09,But it was not meant to hurt anyone.
1,16,109,00:08:41:14,00:08:43:15,It is quite popular these days.
1,16,110,00:08:44:24,00:08:48:14,"It is a Lovers' Charm.
It helps grant one's love."
1,16,111,00:08:54:13,00:08:56:13,I think it was because of that.
1,16,112,00:09:04:01,00:09:07:03,"It seems our daughter has
caused a misunderstanding."
1,16,113,00:09:07:05,00:09:08:07,Our apologies.
1,16,114,00:09:32:01,00:09:35:21,You stayed alive in the body of this dog
1,16,115,00:09:36:19,00:09:38:12,but now you are gone.
1,16,116,00:09:47:06,00:09:50:16,Gwigu has now completely vanished.
1,16,117,00:09:52:16,00:09:54:02,What do I do?
1,16,118,00:09:54:21,00:09:58:14,Is it my fault that Gwigu died?
1,16,119,00:09:58:15,00:09:59:12,Cho-yeon!
1,16,120,00:10:00:06,00:10:02:15,How dare you disgrace Jinyowon?
1,16,121,00:10:27:01,00:10:28:14,Gwigu is dead?
1,16,122,00:10:29:12,00:10:30:13,Yes.
1,16,123,00:10:30:15,00:10:33:11,"Master Lee said he will bury it
in the daylight tomorrow."
1,16,124,00:10:34:22,00:10:36:18,So this dog was Gwigu.
1,16,125,00:10:40:06,00:10:43:03,"It must have known that
I was a soul shifter from the beginning."
1,16,126,00:10:43:23,00:10:46:04,But it never barked at me.
1,16,127,00:10:47:04,00:10:50:15,Was it covering for me too?
1,16,128,00:10:55:05,00:10:56:21,"Even though it is dead, it is still Gwigu."
1,16,129,00:10:57:21,00:11:00:14,"There might still be traces of its powers.
Do not touch it."
1,16,130,00:11:08:21,00:11:11:08,Did the people from Jinyowon leave?
1,16,131,00:11:11:10,00:11:13:01,"They are discussing
another issue right now."
1,16,132,00:11:13:15,00:11:14:15,Another issue?
1,16,133,00:11:15:08,00:11:16:21,It turns out Dang-gu and Cho-yeon
1,16,134,00:11:17:22,00:11:19:02,were lovers.
1,16,135,00:11:20:08,00:11:21:14,"-What?
-What?"
1,16,136,00:11:22:16,00:11:25:23,"I was the one who destroyed
a relic of Jinyowon"
1,16,137,00:11:26:00,00:11:27:22,so Songrim is not at fault.
1,16,138,00:11:28:11,00:11:30:09,We shall now leave.
1,16,139,00:11:31:11,00:11:33:16,"-Let us go.
-Yes."
1,16,140,00:11:33:18,00:11:34:24,Lady Jin.
1,16,141,00:11:35:01,00:11:37:07,Have some tea before you leave.
1,16,142,00:11:37:22,00:11:40:02,"We should clear misunderstandings
and make meaningful bonds."
1,16,143,00:11:40:19,00:11:41:23,Make bonds?
1,16,144,00:11:42:00,00:11:43:24,These two are in love.
1,16,145,00:11:44:01,00:11:46:11,The charm that you took out before
1,16,146,00:11:46:13,00:11:49:04,"was for Dang-gu, right?"
1,16,147,00:11:51:13,00:11:53:20,Yes. I am the cause of all of this.
1,16,148,00:11:54:09,00:11:56:03,Cho-yeon did not do anything wrong.
1,16,149,00:11:56:05,00:11:57:05,Be quiet.
1,16,150,00:11:59:21,00:12:01:13,I found out recently too.
1,16,151,00:12:01:15,00:12:03:10,He was talking nonsense
1,16,152,00:12:03:12,00:12:06:06,"about how they will be together
when your late daughter returns"
1,16,153,00:12:06:08,00:12:08:02,so I reprimanded him.
1,16,154,00:12:08:04,00:12:11:05,"My late daughter?
Bu-yeon is alive and we will find her."
1,16,155,00:12:12:17,00:12:15:08,"Do you really believe
Jin Mu will find her?"
1,16,156,00:12:15:23,00:12:18:20,You are being fooled by him.
1,16,157,00:12:19:10,00:12:21:19,"Did Jin Mu give you the idea
to search all over Songrim"
1,16,158,00:12:21:21,00:12:23:17,looking for Gwigu at this hour?
1,16,159,00:12:23:19,00:12:26:00,I told you not to meddle in our affairs.
1,16,160,00:12:26:14,00:12:29:10,"Now, let us not fight."
1,16,161,00:12:29:12,00:12:32:15,"It would be wonderful news
to find Bu-yeon."
1,16,162,00:12:32:17,00:12:36:06,"Lady Jin does not want to
make enemies with Songrim either."
1,16,163,00:12:37:08,00:12:40:18,Let us be cordial as we were before.
1,16,164,00:12:40:21,00:12:42:07,Who knows?
1,16,165,00:12:42:09,00:12:46:00,"Cho-yeon and Dang-gu
may unite the two families."
1,16,166,00:12:46:02,00:12:47:10,I respectfully decline.
1,16,167,00:12:47:12,00:12:50:05,Cho-yeon will have a better suitor.
1,16,168,00:12:51:18,00:12:55:16,"Who is better than
the Park family of Songrim?"
1,16,169,00:12:55:18,00:12:57:07,A daughter of the Jin family
1,16,170,00:12:57:08,00:13:00:02,"is good enough to be
the bride of the Crown Prince."
1,16,171,00:13:01:16,00:13:02:15,Mother.
1,16,172,00:13:02:17,00:13:04:06,What are you saying?
1,16,173,00:13:05:06,00:13:06:11,I do not want to.
1,16,174,00:13:07:06,00:13:09:08,The Crown Prince is unkind.
1,16,175,00:13:09:10,00:13:11:21,"-I do not like him.
-Cho-yeon."
1,16,176,00:13:12:13,00:13:14:12,I wish to marry the one I love.
1,16,177,00:13:16:01,00:13:16:21,Yes.
1,16,178,00:13:17:12,00:13:19:10,I am the one she loves.
1,16,179,00:13:19:12,00:13:20:13,Dang-gu!
1,16,180,00:13:26:11,00:13:27:16,We will talk at home.
1,16,181,00:13:31:00,00:13:32:18,Let go of his hand and follow me.
1,16,182,00:13:34:20,00:13:36:13,Let her go for now.
1,16,183,00:13:36:15,00:13:38:10,Let go of her hand so she can leave.
1,16,184,00:13:39:18,00:13:41:06,Let go of his hand.
1,16,185,00:13:41:09,00:13:42:11,Let go!
1,16,186,00:13:51:14,00:13:52:14,Cho-yeon.
1,16,187,00:13:52:16,00:13:55:14,"If you wish to be so disobedient,
do not bother coming home."
1,16,188,00:14:04:19,00:14:07:14,I think it is best that we leave.
1,16,189,00:14:10:06,00:14:11:22,Will you not come home with us?
1,16,190,00:14:11:24,00:14:14:10,I will not obey Mother this time.
1,16,191,00:14:15:17,00:14:17:05,"Please understand, Father."
1,16,192,00:14:19:18,00:14:22:10,"I will send word
when your mother's anger subsides."
1,16,193,00:14:24:15,00:14:25:24,Please take care of her for a while.
1,16,194,00:14:26:18,00:14:27:16,I will.
1,16,195,00:14:37:02,00:14:39:22,"Uncle, I apologize for the trouble."
1,16,196,00:14:39:24,00:14:41:13,But I will protect my lady.
1,16,197,00:14:41:15,00:14:42:11,Get out!
1,16,198,00:14:52:17,00:14:55:21,Where should we go now?
1,16,199,00:14:57:24,00:14:59:05,I do not know.
1,16,200,00:15:02:18,00:15:04:19,"Since he told us to leave,"
1,16,201,00:15:04:21,00:15:07:17,we could go to an inn and get…
1,16,202,00:15:08:09,00:15:10:05,"-Get a room?
-Sorry?"
1,16,203,00:15:12:15,00:15:13:19,That is not what I meant!
1,16,204,00:15:13:21,00:15:16:17,"Not one room,
but separate rooms of course."
1,16,205,00:15:19:24,00:15:22:08,I do not like inns.
1,16,206,00:15:24:02,00:15:27:00,There is nowhere else to go for now.
1,16,207,00:15:27:02,00:15:28:14,And it is getting cold…
1,16,208,00:15:29:08,00:15:30:09,It is cold…
1,16,209,00:15:32:22,00:15:34:04,Where can we go?
1,16,210,00:15:34:06,00:15:35:15,Young Master Park!
1,16,211,00:15:37:01,00:15:40:10,"They said Young Master Jang was released,
but he is not in his room."
1,16,212,00:15:40:12,00:15:41:20,Have you seen him?
1,16,213,00:15:46:18,00:15:48:18,Is there something wrong?
1,16,214,00:15:51:21,00:15:53:23,"-Maidservant Kim…
-What?"
1,16,215,00:15:54:00,00:15:55:00,Maidservant Kim.
1,16,216,00:15:55:03,00:15:57:01,"Please let go, Young Master Park."
1,16,217,00:15:57:19,00:16:00:08,Young Lady Jin? What is going on?
1,16,218,00:16:00:10,00:16:02:00,Maidservant Kim…
1,16,219,00:16:02:03,00:16:04:14,"Gwigu, which caused mayhem at the palace,"
1,16,220,00:16:04:16,00:16:08:09,"was destroyed by Lady Jin
as she was trying to retrieve it."
1,16,221,00:16:08:11,00:16:10:05,Gwigu was destroyed?
1,16,222,00:16:10:07,00:16:12:04,"Why would she destroy something
that detects sorcery?"
1,16,223,00:16:12:06,00:16:14:16,Detecting sorcery was just an excuse.
1,16,224,00:16:14:18,00:16:17:17,"It was a relic that Songrim used
to threaten the royal family."
1,16,225,00:16:18:06,00:16:19:22,Jin Mu is right.
1,16,226,00:16:19:24,00:16:23:12,"Songrim wanted to show off
that they were more powerful than us."
1,16,227,00:16:24:20,00:16:26:17,"Under the guise of rooting out sorcery,"
1,16,228,00:16:26:19,00:16:29:06,"Songrim can mobilize
the mages of the Unanimous Assembly"
1,16,229,00:16:29:09,00:16:31:08,and dethrone the king.
1,16,230,00:16:32:00,00:16:34:07,"Is that why they mentioned
the King's Star?"
1,16,231,00:16:34:09,00:16:37:10,To warn me that they could dethrone me?
1,16,232,00:16:38:09,00:16:41:05,"The reason Master Lee mentioned
the King's Star was to explain"
1,16,233,00:16:41:07,00:16:44:21,"that someone like Master Seo Gyeong
will come to save us from troubled times."
1,16,234,00:16:44:23,00:16:46:20,It was not to threaten us.
1,16,235,00:16:46:22,00:16:50:04,"What if the one that saves us
wants to rule us as well?"
1,16,236,00:16:51:01,00:16:52:10,Do you think you can stop him?
1,16,237,00:16:54:00,00:16:55:15,Gwanju Jang Gang of Cheonbugwan
1,16,238,00:16:55:17,00:16:57:09,"predicted that
the King's Star will appear."
1,16,239,00:16:57:24,00:16:59:11,Master Lee said that as well.
1,16,240,00:17:00:24,00:17:03:22,Does Songrim know this too?
1,16,241,00:17:11:08,00:17:15:22,"He tried to sire a son with the energy of
the King's Star from his many concubines."
1,16,242,00:17:15:24,00:17:18:12,Now he is trying to find one in Songrim.
1,16,243,00:17:19:07,00:17:21:14,"It is natural
for the King to be so threatened."
1,16,244,00:17:22:18,00:17:24:06,"To the royal household of Go,"
1,16,245,00:17:24:08,00:17:27:11,"the existence of the King's Star
could signal treason."
1,16,246,00:17:34:14,00:17:35:16,"""Treason""?"
1,16,247,00:17:36:13,00:17:39:10,"People of Daeho do believe in
and worship the heavens,"
1,16,248,00:17:40:02,00:17:42:19,"but a centuries-old monarchy
would not crumble so easily."
1,16,249,00:17:42:21,00:17:45:13,"It is preposterous to think
that one can become king"
1,16,250,00:17:45:15,00:17:46:23,because of some constellation.
1,16,251,00:17:47:00,00:17:49:18,"If he is from Songrim, it is possible."
1,16,252,00:17:50:22,00:17:53:22,"Master Seo Gyeong of Songrim
saved the world 200 years ago."
1,16,253,00:17:54:12,00:17:58:18,He is still revered within Daeho.
1,16,254,00:18:00:05,00:18:02:21,"If someone was born under the King's Star
like Master Seo Gyeong,"
1,16,255,00:18:02:23,00:18:07:15,"it could make a convincing reason
to become a King."
1,16,256,00:18:09:12,00:18:11:01,So you think
1,16,257,00:18:11:24,00:18:15:02,the King's worries may come true?
1,16,258,00:18:17:15,00:18:19:01,Do not be concerned.
1,16,259,00:18:19:23,00:18:24:14,"As long as I am here,
that will never happen."
1,16,260,00:18:29:09,00:18:30:14,Very well.
1,16,261,00:18:30:16,00:18:35:05,"I will not be foolish like my father
and live under constant fear."
1,16,262,00:18:39:13,00:18:41:22,"When I brought Gwigu to the palace,"
1,16,263,00:18:42:16,00:18:44:14,I could see that you were right.
1,16,264,00:18:44:16,00:18:47:22,The Queen is on Jin Mu's side.
1,16,265,00:18:48:00,00:18:51:24,"But we cannot provoke
the royal family just yet."
1,16,266,00:18:52:01,00:18:54:09,"If Songrim tries
to take on the royal family,"
1,16,267,00:18:54:11,00:18:57:13,"Jin Mu will surely use
the circumstances of Uk's birth"
1,16,268,00:18:57:15,00:18:59:24,"and turn him into
the enemy of the royal family."
1,16,269,00:19:00:18,00:19:03:17,"Then Songrim will become
an enemy of the royal family as well"
1,16,270,00:19:03:19,00:19:05:08,for taking him in.
1,16,271,00:19:06:05,00:19:07:19,We need Jang Gang.
1,16,272,00:19:09:02,00:19:11:13,Jang Gang knows the truth.
1,16,273,00:19:12:03,00:19:14:14,He must know Jin Mu's weakness as well.
1,16,274,00:19:14:16,00:19:19:00,"How can you find someone
who has been wandering for decades?"
1,16,275,00:19:19:15,00:19:22:02,"We will have to wait
until he returns of his own accord."
1,16,276,00:19:23:04,00:19:27:02,"The rumors about soul shifters
have spread throughout Daeho Fortress."
1,16,277,00:19:27:04,00:19:30:06,"If he hears the rumors, he will return,"
1,16,278,00:19:30:08,00:19:35:04,fearing for Songrim and for his son.
1,16,279,00:20:13:23,00:20:15:16,I came because I was summoned.
1,16,280,00:20:15:18,00:20:17:06,Where is Master Lee?
1,16,281,00:20:19:04,00:20:21:09,He left for Danhyanggok at dawn
1,16,282,00:20:21:22,00:20:23:08,to bury Sapsali.
1,16,283,00:20:23:23,00:20:24:21,What?
1,16,284,00:20:25:10,00:20:28:09,"He is not here? Was it not Master Lee
who summoned me?"
1,16,285,00:20:28:11,00:20:29:22,He did summon you.
1,16,286,00:20:31:17,00:20:33:11,He told me to give this to you.
1,16,287,00:20:36:04,00:20:40:11,"This is the assassin Naksu's sword
that he retrieved from the Crown Prince."
1,16,288,00:20:41:15,00:20:44:02,"He said you are the only one
who can keep this sword"
1,16,289,00:20:44:05,00:20:45:22,so he told me to give it to you.
1,16,290,00:20:46:21,00:20:48:12,He just left me this sword?
1,16,291,00:20:49:10,00:20:51:20,"Did he not say anything else
before leaving?"
1,16,292,00:20:51:22,00:20:55:02,"He did not take you in as his pupil,"
1,16,293,00:20:55:04,00:20:58:09,"so I do not understand
why he is treating you fondly."
1,16,294,00:20:58:22,00:21:00:17,You will not even practice chastity.
1,16,295,00:21:02:22,00:21:06:05,"I heard from Park Jin that
you are head over heels for a woman."
1,16,296,00:21:06:21,00:21:08:13,"If you were in love with Mu-deok,"
1,16,297,00:21:08:16,00:21:10:09,why did you lead on my Yun-ok?
1,16,298,00:21:11:22,00:21:14:06,"-I never led her on.
-Did you not?"
1,16,299,00:21:14:08,00:21:15:17,You charmed Yun-ok.
1,16,300,00:21:15:19,00:21:18:16,How did you manage to charm Master Lee?
1,16,301,00:21:18:18,00:21:20:12,I did not do anything.
1,16,302,00:21:20:14,00:21:23:15,"Just because someone is being good to me,"
1,16,303,00:21:23:17,00:21:25:19,does not mean I charmed them.
1,16,304,00:21:27:01,00:21:30:02,Be mindful of Yun-ok from now on
1,16,305,00:21:30:05,00:21:31:20,and be respectful to Master Lee.
1,16,306,00:21:31:22,00:21:32:23,Yes.
1,16,307,00:21:33:01,00:21:36:15,"Master Lee is not close-minded
like other masters at Songrim."
1,16,308,00:21:36:17,00:21:39:22,He seems to be open-minded and gracious.
1,16,309,00:21:39:24,00:21:41:13,I respect him.
1,16,310,00:21:42:09,00:21:45:12,You have no idea how strict he can be.
1,16,311,00:21:46:10,00:21:50:14,He is merciless towards those who stray.
1,16,312,00:21:50:17,00:21:53:11,So you must always be careful.
1,16,313,00:21:53:13,00:21:54:16,Take it and be off.
1,16,314,00:22:01:17,00:22:02:19,I forgot.
1,16,315,00:22:02:21,00:22:04:11,I almost got in trouble again.
1,16,316,00:22:04:13,00:22:06:14,I was told to give you this message
1,16,317,00:22:06:16,00:22:09:04,when I gave you Naksu's sword.
1,16,318,00:22:21:06,00:22:23:07,Why would he give you my sword?
1,16,319,00:22:23:22,00:22:26:02,"Because I have you,"
1,16,320,00:22:26:21,00:22:28:16,I should have your sword too.
1,16,321,00:22:29:14,00:22:32:15,"Anyway, this means
he will continue to turn a blind eye."
1,16,322,00:22:32:18,00:22:34:01,That is good.
1,16,323,00:22:39:13,00:22:42:07,I was told to give you this message.
1,16,324,00:22:47:02,00:22:49:12,Jang Uk must keep that sword safe.
1,16,325,00:22:49:14,00:22:53:11,"If anyone tries to use the sword,
they must be killed."
1,16,326,00:22:55:14,00:22:57:10,"If he fails to do so,"
1,16,327,00:22:59:16,00:23:01:12,he will die as well.
1,16,328,00:23:04:16,00:23:08:17,"It was a warning that he will kill us
if Mu-deok ever uses the sword"
1,16,329,00:23:09:14,00:23:11:00,"as the assassin, Naksu."
1,16,330,00:23:15:14,00:23:17:18,"The sword feels strange,
even though it is mine."
1,16,331,00:23:19:00,00:23:21:15,"He must have let me live
because he knows I cannot use it."
1,16,332,00:23:22:17,00:23:25:07,It means you will be safe as Mu-deok.
1,16,333,00:23:26:01,00:23:28:09,"If I become Naksu, I will be in danger."
1,16,334,00:23:29:10,00:23:31:16,"Once I find the ice stone
and regain my energy,"
1,16,335,00:23:32:09,00:23:34:11,I will also gain many enemies.
1,16,336,00:23:36:08,00:23:37:20,What happens to me then
1,16,337,00:23:38:11,00:23:39:23,will have nothing to do with you.
1,16,338,00:23:40:01,00:23:41:00,Why?
1,16,339,00:23:41:17,00:23:43:22,"Because we will no longer be
master and pupil?"
1,16,340,00:23:43:24,00:23:46:07,"You will no longer
have a reason to protect me."
1,16,341,00:23:46:09,00:23:48:08,"Nor will I have a reason
to go easy on you."
1,16,342,00:23:49:17,00:23:52:03,That was our promise from the start.
1,16,343,00:23:59:20,00:24:01:10,Then promise me one more thing.
1,16,344,00:24:02:02,00:24:04:09,"Out of duty and loyalty,"
1,16,345,00:24:04:12,00:24:08:13,"and also out of the so-called love,
you can grant me one more wish."
1,16,346,00:24:10:01,00:24:11:21,Fine. What is it?
1,16,347,00:24:12:14,00:24:14:02,When you regain your energy
1,16,348,00:24:14:18,00:24:17:07,"and if you must draw
and point that sword at someone,"
1,16,349,00:24:18:09,00:24:20:03,point it at me before at anyone else.
1,16,350,00:24:23:04,00:24:24:05,"If you stab me,"
1,16,351,00:24:24:20,00:24:29:15,"then I will die as the one
who released the assassin."
1,16,352,00:24:33:09,00:24:34:17,"If you withdraw your sword,"
1,16,353,00:24:35:16,00:24:37:19,I will make you another promise.
1,16,354,00:24:39:12,00:24:41:09,Something along the lines of the promise
1,16,355,00:24:41:11,00:24:45:19,"you wanted to hear
from me about our future."
1,16,356,00:24:54:05,00:24:57:13,"I will look for the ice stone
so you do not run wild"
1,16,357,00:24:58:23,00:25:00:13,because I promised to do so.
1,16,358,00:25:11:17,00:25:13:10,The runaway couple
1,16,359,00:25:14:11,00:25:15:23,is staying at my house.
1,16,360,00:25:17:19,00:25:20:00,Dang-gu is there?
1,16,361,00:25:22:14,00:25:26:17,Why did you take them in?
1,16,362,00:25:26:19,00:25:27:23,"If not,"
1,16,363,00:25:28:00,00:25:29:21,should I have left them to go into town
1,16,364,00:25:29:23,00:25:33:09,"to build a lover's nest
and become the talk of the town?"
1,16,365,00:25:35:10,00:25:36:15,I ask you to be discrete
1,16,366,00:25:36:17,00:25:39:19,and take good care of them.
1,16,367,00:25:39:21,00:25:42:07,They are a sweet couple.
1,16,368,00:25:42:09,00:25:44:03,Why are you so against it?
1,16,369,00:25:44:05,00:25:46:11,They cannot marry.
1,16,370,00:25:46:13,00:25:48:08,So you kicked them out?
1,16,371,00:25:48:23,00:25:50:19,"My lord, you must stop
this habit of yours."
1,16,372,00:25:51:22,00:25:55:08,"You held Mu-deok and Young Master Jang
for no reason the other night."
1,16,373,00:25:55:10,00:25:57:15,You must become more tolerant as you age.
1,16,374,00:25:58:05,00:25:59:08,Such a shame…
1,16,375,00:26:01:04,00:26:03:08,I like Mu-deok a lot.
1,16,376,00:26:03:10,00:26:06:08,I like Young Master Jang very much.
1,16,377,00:26:07:05,00:26:08:03,Maidservant Kim.
1,16,378,00:26:08:22,00:26:11:09,What would you do
1,16,379,00:26:12:18,00:26:15:13,"if Uk falls in love
with a woman he should not,"
1,16,380,00:26:16:04,00:26:17:03,like Dang-gu?
1,16,381,00:26:17:06,00:26:19:06,Would you be tolerant?
1,16,382,00:26:23:19,00:26:27:08,"Whoever Young Master Jang loves
is fine with me."
1,16,383,00:26:27:10,00:26:29:04,"-Is that right?
-Of course."
1,16,384,00:26:32:02,00:26:33:03,I am sure you will.
1,16,385,00:26:33:18,00:26:35:20,I know that you care about
1,16,386,00:26:35:23,00:26:38:22,"birth, appearance, age, and much more."
1,16,387,00:26:38:24,00:26:40:14,The heart is the most important.
1,16,388,00:26:41:03,00:26:44:01,"If you are in love,
appearances do not matter."
1,16,389,00:26:44:20,00:26:47:04,"So what if she is not that beautiful,"
1,16,390,00:26:47:06,00:26:49:16,or if they have a great age difference?
1,16,391,00:26:55:20,00:26:59:08,Is that how you feel too?
1,16,392,00:27:00:12,00:27:01:15,Is it?
1,16,393,00:27:01:17,00:27:02:21,Pardon?
1,16,394,00:27:06:06,00:27:09:17,Anyone who is not as handsome as Jang Gang
1,16,395,00:27:10:15,00:27:12:06,and is much older
1,16,396,00:27:12:08,00:27:15:20,would still have a chance
1,16,397,00:27:17:08,00:27:18:18,if your heart is moved?
1,16,398,00:27:20:11,00:27:21:15,Well…
1,16,399,00:27:25:00,00:27:26:13,"If my heart is moved,"
1,16,400,00:27:28:06,00:27:31:03,he would seem more handsome
1,16,401,00:27:31:05,00:27:32:13,and younger in my eyes.
1,16,402,00:27:45:07,00:27:48:00,"I see, Maidservant Kim."
1,16,403,00:27:49:08,00:27:50:14,I understand what you mean.
1,16,404,00:28:08:07,00:28:13:04,"Goodness, he was quite straightforward
when he asked how I felt about him."
1,16,405,00:28:14:15,00:28:16:20,What does he mean by not being handsome?
1,16,406,00:28:16:22,00:28:18:22,And he is only two years older than me.
1,16,407,00:28:22:01,00:28:23:19,He worries for no reason.
1,16,408,00:28:34:10,00:28:38:13,How can she say she likes Master Lee
1,16,409,00:28:38:15,00:28:40:09,so easily in front of me?
1,16,410,00:28:44:10,00:28:46:03,Is he handsome?
1,16,411,00:28:48:01,00:28:51:11,"He is more than
a hundred years older than her."
1,16,412,00:29:01:23,00:29:03:02,Dang-gu…
1,16,413,00:29:03:19,00:29:05:17,You little brat!
1,16,414,00:29:09:12,00:29:10:20,"Right now,"
1,16,415,00:29:12:05,00:29:15:23,"I wish I could have
the wine hidden in Uncle's room"
1,16,416,00:29:17:03,00:29:18:09,instead of tea.
1,16,417,00:29:18:11,00:29:20:23,What? You already have regrets?
1,16,418,00:29:21:12,00:29:22:13,No way.
1,16,419,00:29:23:05,00:29:26:13,I believed I could give it all up.
1,16,420,00:29:26:15,00:29:29:09,That is why I took her hand that day.
1,16,421,00:29:31:16,00:29:34:23,"I did not know
he would grab my hand so suddenly."
1,16,422,00:29:35:17,00:29:38:15,"I was just upset that
they were talking about the Crown Prince."
1,16,423,00:29:38:17,00:29:41:02,"All I said was that
I do not like the Crown Prince."
1,16,424,00:29:41:18,00:29:44:02,"But he suddenly grabbed my hand
and said he loved me."
1,16,425,00:29:44:04,00:29:45:11,Move over a bit.
1,16,426,00:29:48:12,00:29:50:16,I could not just let go of his hand.
1,16,427,00:29:50:18,00:29:52:20,I was simply swept up in the moment.
1,16,428,00:29:53:18,00:29:56:10,I had no intention to run away from home.
1,16,429,00:29:58:01,00:29:59:17,How long will you be here?
1,16,430,00:30:01:06,00:30:03:18,"I was told to serve you two
while you are here."
1,16,431,00:30:06:00,00:30:07:11,I have no idea.
1,16,432,00:30:07:13,00:30:09:16,I do not wish to stay here for long.
1,16,433,00:30:10:13,00:30:13:20,"If I say we should go back home,"
1,16,434,00:30:13:22,00:30:16:01,"I would seem irresponsible, right?"
1,16,435,00:30:16:03,00:30:19:01,"If I say I want to go home,
it would break his heart, right?"
1,16,436,00:30:20:02,00:30:21:19,"-What do I do?
-What do I do?"
1,16,437,00:30:23:12,00:30:25:00,This is for the best.
1,16,438,00:30:25:02,00:30:27:05,Serving Young Lady Jin here
1,16,439,00:30:27:07,00:30:29:16,"is better than
running into Park Jin at Songrim."
1,16,440,00:30:29:18,00:30:34:06,"If So-i is responsible
for the murder case you are embroiled in,"
1,16,441,00:30:34:21,00:30:36:00,then it is dangerous.
1,16,442,00:30:36:02,00:30:39:20,"You may not know her,
but she knows who Mu-deok is."
1,16,443,00:30:41:17,00:30:44:17,Why is So-i going around killing people?
1,16,444,00:30:48:13,00:30:50:17,"If the blind girl
these men were picking on"
1,16,445,00:30:50:20,00:30:52:16,"is the same girl the broker knew as So-i,"
1,16,446,00:30:53:04,00:30:54:23,"then she probably
could not have killed them herself."
1,16,447,00:30:55:00,00:30:56:12,She must have someone helping her.
1,16,448,00:30:56:15,00:30:59:20,"If the authorities take these bodies,
they will catch the murderer."
1,16,449,00:31:00:15,00:31:02:06,Mu-deok would know about So-i.
1,16,450,00:31:02:09,00:31:04:15,"We should send her
to help with the investigation."
1,16,451,00:31:05:20,00:31:07:13,She will not recognize So-i.
1,16,452,00:31:07:15,00:31:10:01,"She is not the same Mu-deok
who lived in Sari Village."
1,16,453,00:31:10:03,00:31:13:01,She will be falsely accused and suffer.
1,16,454,00:31:13:04,00:31:16:01,I will ask her myself if necessary.
1,16,455,00:31:23:03,00:31:26:09,"I do not think you need to step up.
Yul seems to be on top of it."
1,16,456,00:31:33:20,00:31:36:14,"We will be in trouble if
the Assistant Gwanju hears you are out."
1,16,457,00:31:37:02,00:31:39:21,"Everyone who recognizes me
has been killed."
1,16,458,00:31:39:23,00:31:42:04,"I would have to walk outside
even after I get into Jinyowon."
1,16,459,00:31:42:06,00:31:44:09,"I should practice
walking like a blind person."
1,16,460,00:31:45:13,00:31:46:24,You should buy what you want.
1,16,461,00:31:47:01,00:31:48:24,I gave you quite a bit of money.
1,16,462,00:31:50:13,00:31:52:03,Let us go back after a while.
1,16,463,00:31:53:11,00:31:54:17,Wait a minute.
1,16,464,00:31:55:14,00:31:57:20,"Why are you using an umbrella
instead of a cane?"
1,16,465,00:31:59:20,00:32:01:00,Do not touch it.
1,16,466,00:32:03:00,00:32:04:09,I prefer using this.
1,16,467,00:32:16:08,00:32:19:05,You did help prove my innocence.
1,16,468,00:32:19:07,00:32:21:15,"I hope you will be comfortable
while you are here."
1,16,469,00:32:21:17,00:32:23:23,Does the Jang family always eat like this?
1,16,470,00:32:25:04,00:32:26:10,This is too greasy.
1,16,471,00:32:29:18,00:32:32:16,"Yes, Young Lady.
I will prepare a different meal."
1,16,472,00:32:41:22,00:32:43:16,This is too salty!
1,16,473,00:32:46:02,00:32:48:01,"-It is not salty.
-It is salty."
1,16,474,00:32:48:03,00:32:50:08,I get bloated when I eat salty foods.
1,16,475,00:32:53:01,00:32:54:07,"Yes, Young Lady."
1,16,476,00:32:57:08,00:32:58:10,This is too hard.
1,16,477,00:32:58:12,00:33:00:08,This is too sweet.
1,16,478,00:33:01:14,00:33:02:21,What is this?
1,16,479,00:33:04:02,00:33:05:23,I am so worried I lost my appetite.
1,16,480,00:33:07:24,00:33:11:04,Why is she acting exactly like Uk?
1,16,481,00:33:11:22,00:33:13:04,I have no appetite.
1,16,482,00:33:13:07,00:33:14:19,Do you have something to drink?
1,16,483,00:33:14:21,00:33:16:11,Like cinnamon punch or rice punch?
1,16,484,00:33:21:23,00:33:24:13,"They are perfect for each other.
Why call off the wedding?"
1,16,485,00:33:24:15,00:33:28:03,"If they got married,
one of them would have died in a fight."
1,16,486,00:33:32:23,00:33:34:02,"Mu-deok, the rice punch is…"
1,16,487,00:33:34:04,00:33:36:07,Is it sweet? And too cold?
1,16,488,00:33:36:23,00:33:39:01,Rice punch is supposed to be like that.
1,16,489,00:33:39:19,00:33:41:10,Why are you raising your voice?
1,16,490,00:33:41:12,00:33:43:01,Are you tired of serving me?
1,16,491,00:33:43:23,00:33:46:02,Then would you say you were easy to serve?
1,16,492,00:33:48:13,00:33:50:19,I get irritable when I am anxious.
1,16,493,00:33:50:21,00:33:52:20,It is uncomfortable not being at home.
1,16,494,00:33:52:22,00:33:54:17,Then go home.
1,16,495,00:33:55:18,00:33:58:12,No. I am too scared.
1,16,496,00:33:58:14,00:34:00:13,Mother is very angry with me.
1,16,497,00:34:02:01,00:34:05:10,"Even for a daughter, you are a handful."
1,16,498,00:34:05:12,00:34:07:10,I was never her favorite.
1,16,499,00:34:08:14,00:34:10:18,My sister was her pride and joy.
1,16,500,00:34:12:15,00:34:14:16,"Even though she was blind,"
1,16,501,00:34:14:17,00:34:16:17,she could see energy and handle relics.
1,16,502,00:34:16:20,00:34:19:14,"Even at a young age, her abilities
were as powerful as my mother's."
1,16,503,00:34:19:16,00:34:22:12,"Well, I heard that the Jin family members"
1,16,504,00:34:22:14,00:34:25:08,"are born with more divine powers
than spell-related powers."
1,16,505,00:34:25:23,00:34:28:02,"You saw me handle Gwigu, right?"
1,16,506,00:34:28:19,00:34:30:07,It is like that.
1,16,507,00:34:30:10,00:34:32:05,A really powerful priestess
1,16,508,00:34:32:06,00:34:35:17,"can control people's souls
and trap them to be helpless."
1,16,509,00:34:36:15,00:34:38:23,"-Trap the soul?
-Yes."
1,16,510,00:34:39:00,00:34:41:01,"If the priestess traps their powers,"
1,16,511,00:34:41:04,00:34:44:16,even the most powerful mage is helpless.
1,16,512,00:34:46:14,00:34:49:00,I heard there are shamans
1,16,513,00:34:49:02,00:34:51:06,"who can erase or change
memories of a soul."
1,16,514,00:34:51:08,00:34:54:01,"A Jinyowon priestess is
in a different league."
1,16,515,00:34:54:03,00:34:57:06,How did such an amazing girl like her die?
1,16,516,00:34:58:20,00:35:00:08,Because she is that great.
1,16,517,00:35:02:01,00:35:04:01,She is definitely alive.
1,16,518,00:35:05:22,00:35:07:12,We will see her again.
1,16,519,00:35:13:19,00:35:15:04,If she is alive
1,16,520,00:35:16:03,00:35:17:14,I am sure you will.
1,16,521,00:35:26:10,00:35:29:09,Uncle looked into Mu-deok.
1,16,522,00:35:29:24,00:35:32:22,"He asked the broker about her.
Did you know about that?"
1,16,523,00:35:33:18,00:35:35:12,Yes. I heard from her.
1,16,524,00:35:37:12,00:35:39:23,"He has become suspicious
because of the soul shifter incident."
1,16,525,00:35:40:12,00:35:41:10,You are right.
1,16,526,00:35:41:12,00:35:45:20,"If there are soul shifters in the palace,
Songrim may have them too."
1,16,527,00:35:46:17,00:35:50:12,"Why is the cast-out successor of Songrim
worrying about such a thing?"
1,16,528,00:35:50:15,00:35:54:18,"-I am not totally cast out.
-He is already regretting it."
1,16,529,00:35:54:20,00:35:55:16,Hey.
1,16,530,00:35:55:18,00:35:58:01,You were so confident yesterday.
1,16,531,00:36:00:10,00:36:02:00,Uk is the one who always gets kicked out.
1,16,532,00:36:02:02,00:36:03:13,What am I doing here?
1,16,533,00:36:03:15,00:36:05:18,You will get used to it.
1,16,534,00:36:05:20,00:36:09:01,It is quite miserable the first time.
1,16,535,00:36:10:16,00:36:12:14,Only Yul would have no idea how we feel.
1,16,536,00:36:12:16,00:36:13:21,What do you mean?
1,16,537,00:36:13:23,00:36:15:00,Yul has been kicked out too.
1,16,538,00:36:15:02,00:36:16:04,No way.
1,16,539,00:36:16:22,00:36:19:01,"Do you remember the time
that I broke the gold-plated inkstone"
1,16,540,00:36:19:03,00:36:20:15,and we all lied together?
1,16,541,00:36:25:19,00:36:29:03,Uncle will get so mad at me.
1,16,542,00:36:29:18,00:36:30:15,Let us hide it.
1,16,543,00:36:31:14,00:36:33:16,"We will bury it
and pretend to know nothing about it."
1,16,544,00:36:34:05,00:36:35:11,That is not right.
1,16,545,00:36:36:06,00:36:38:14,"We must tell the truth
and ask for forgiveness."
1,16,546,00:36:38:16,00:36:41:18,"Then Dang-gu will get in
a lot of trouble with the leader."
1,16,547,00:36:44:19,00:36:46:19,I cannot tell a lie.
1,16,548,00:36:48:08,00:36:50:02,"It is all right, Dang-gu."
1,16,549,00:36:50:23,00:36:52:14,I am sure there is a way.
1,16,550,00:36:54:19,00:36:58:11,"Eventually the three of us
agreed to cover it up."
1,16,551,00:36:58:13,00:37:00:24,But Yul became ill afterward.
1,16,552,00:37:01:13,00:37:04:12,I think Yul is very ill.
1,16,553,00:37:04:14,00:37:05:20,I think so.
1,16,554,00:37:07:18,00:37:12:01,"My goodness,
why is Yul so sick? What is wrong?"
1,16,555,00:37:12:16,00:37:16:03,I heard he cannot eat or sleep well.
1,16,556,00:37:16:05,00:37:17:08,What is wrong?
1,16,557,00:37:18:17,00:37:21:18,Yul had never done anything wrong.
1,16,558,00:37:21:20,00:37:24:06,He got sick worrying we would get caught.
1,16,559,00:37:25:01,00:37:28:11,"We ended up confessing
because we thought Yul would die."
1,16,560,00:37:28:13,00:37:30:16,We were all kicked out together.
1,16,561,00:37:30:18,00:37:34:00,"I got kicked out so many times
so I do not remember everything."
1,16,562,00:37:34:03,00:37:37:16,"But I doubt that Yul was sick
because he was afraid of being caught."
1,16,563,00:37:39:02,00:37:41:20,"He suffered because he knew
what he was doing was wrong,"
1,16,564,00:37:42:11,00:37:45:15,and that fact was hard for him to endure.
1,16,565,00:37:49:24,00:37:52:03,"He is someone who gets lost
if he is caught off guard."
1,16,566,00:37:53:21,00:37:56:20,"He must have been worried
and scared to do something"
1,16,567,00:37:57:15,00:37:59:02,he knew was wrong
1,16,568,00:38:00:17,00:38:02:04,just to protect his friends.
1,16,569,00:38:07:08,00:38:09:19,Yes. I remember it clearly.
1,16,570,00:38:11:03,00:38:12:13,I suffered quite a bit.
1,16,571,00:38:13:15,00:38:15:13,To punish oneself more harshly
1,16,572,00:38:15:15,00:38:18:12,than others would.
1,16,573,00:38:18:14,00:38:20:20,"Is it some sort of
a heightened state of morality?"
1,16,574,00:38:21:13,00:38:24:07,"Gosh, you were already there
at that young age?"
1,16,575,00:38:24:09,00:38:25:10,That is incredible.
1,16,576,00:38:27:02,00:38:29:21,"Can you imagine what I felt,
burying a broken inkstone"
1,16,577,00:38:29:23,00:38:31:08,with my immature friends?
1,16,578,00:38:32:17,00:38:35:04,"We could not even bury it well.
We were soon caught."
1,16,579,00:38:35:06,00:38:36:14,"-What?
-What?"
1,16,580,00:38:36:16,00:38:39:08,We were caught? You said we confessed.
1,16,581,00:38:39:23,00:38:41:23,Dang-gu is remembering it wrong.
1,16,582,00:38:42:00,00:38:43:11,We did not confess to it.
1,16,583,00:38:44:12,00:38:47:22,"Sang-ho found the half-buried inkstone.
That is how we were caught."
1,16,584,00:38:48:13,00:38:49:16,Is that right?
1,16,585,00:38:50:06,00:38:51:18,I must have romanticized the memory.
1,16,586,00:38:53:03,00:38:55:10,I thought we did the honorable thing.
1,16,587,00:38:55:12,00:38:57:01,How embarrassing…
1,16,588,00:38:57:04,00:38:59:24,What are you embarrassed about?
1,16,589,00:39:00:02,00:39:02:05,You are currently a runaway.
1,16,590,00:39:02:07,00:39:05:00,"Who will be the next leader
instead of Dang-gu?"
1,16,591,00:39:06:06,00:39:07:04,Will it be Sang-ho?
1,16,592,00:39:07:06,00:39:08:16,Is that right?
1,16,593,00:39:08:18,00:39:11:00,I should get on his good side.
1,16,594,00:39:11:24,00:39:14:05,You two cannot discard me like this.
1,16,595,00:39:14:07,00:39:16:05,You should take my side like before.
1,16,596,00:39:16:07,00:39:18:04,"Come on, Uk."
1,16,597,00:39:18:06,00:39:20:20,I will not be much help to you.
1,16,598,00:39:21:16,00:39:24:15,"-Hey, Yul.
-I am not good with words."
1,16,599,00:39:25:02,00:39:26:08,Especially about love…
1,16,600,00:39:34:22,00:39:36:10,Of course you two are on my side.
1,16,601,00:39:54:19,00:39:57:13,"Yul, do you not sleep well these days?"
1,16,602,00:39:57:16,00:40:00:16,Drink as much as you want today
1,16,603,00:40:00:18,00:40:02:18,and get a good night's sleep.
1,16,604,00:40:04:01,00:40:06:01,You have trouble sleeping?
1,16,605,00:40:06:17,00:40:07:17,No.
1,16,606,00:40:07:19,00:40:09:09,I saw you wandering around until late.
1,16,607,00:40:09:11,00:40:11:05,You usually go to bed like clockwork.
1,16,608,00:40:11:08,00:40:14:15,"Are you concerned about
what is happening at Seoho Fortress?"
1,16,609,00:40:21:22,00:40:24:09,I just slashed a soul shifter.
1,16,610,00:40:25:18,00:40:27:20,It is our duty to protect this world
1,16,611,00:40:28:21,00:40:30:08,from such monsters.
1,16,612,00:40:31:24,00:40:33:22,"Even though it is dead, it is still Gwigu."
1,16,613,00:40:34:10,00:40:35:21,There might still be traces of its powers.
1,16,614,00:40:35:23,00:40:37:11,Do not touch it.
1,16,615,00:40:44:14,00:40:46:15,"You are feigning ignorance, right?"
1,16,616,00:40:50:01,00:40:52:00,Like the time we buried the inkstone.
1,16,617,00:40:53:09,00:40:56:09,It must be tough for you.
1,16,618,00:41:14:14,00:41:16:20,"If I regain my energy and draw that sword,"
1,16,619,00:41:18:21,00:41:22:22,"will I be able to slash
anyone relentlessly like before?"
1,16,620,00:41:27:17,00:41:29:11,Is that the assassin's sword?
1,16,621,00:41:31:00,00:41:33:08,Why did Young Master bring it again?
1,16,622,00:41:34:08,00:41:37:20,I am terrified of that sword.
1,16,623,00:41:38:22,00:41:40:24,It feels ominous. I do not want it nearby.
1,16,624,00:41:43:08,00:41:46:08,The guests are all asleep. Go to bed.
1,16,625,00:41:47:00,00:41:48:15,Maybe we need to have a charm written.
1,16,626,00:41:58:20,00:42:00:04,Terrifying…
1,16,627,00:42:03:05,00:42:04:10,and ominous.
1,16,628,00:42:34:20,00:42:36:22,"Eunuch Kim,
who caused trouble at Cheonbugwan,"
1,16,629,00:42:36:24,00:42:38:18,is not beside the Queen today as well.
1,16,630,00:42:39:17,00:42:41:01,Did you look into it?
1,16,631,00:42:41:03,00:42:44:10,"They say he is ill and is resting,
but no one seems to know where he is."
1,16,632,00:42:46:04,00:42:48:09,Find out as much as you can about him.
1,16,633,00:42:48:12,00:42:49:24,"Find out when he came to the palace,"
1,16,634,00:42:50:01,00:42:53:02,"when he started serving the Queen,
and if there is anything odd about him."
1,16,635,00:42:53:23,00:42:55:08,Be discrete.
1,16,636,00:42:56:01,00:42:56:24,"Yes, Your Royal Highness."
1,16,637,00:43:03:00,00:43:06:12,"Do you remember what Eunuch Kim said
when we saw him at Cheonbugwan?"
1,16,638,00:43:08:18,00:43:10:23,Did that wench Shaman Choi
1,16,639,00:43:11:14,00:43:13:13,tell you to kill me?
1,16,640,00:43:14:02,00:43:15:20,Shaman Choi…
1,16,641,00:43:15:22,00:43:18:24,"She must be superior to Jin Mu
to have given him orders."
1,16,642,00:43:20:00,00:43:21:18,It must be the Queen.
1,16,643,00:43:21:20,00:43:24:12,Just as Mu-deok's true identity is Naksu.
1,16,644,00:43:24:15,00:43:26:06,Could the true identity of the Queen
1,16,645,00:43:27:07,00:43:29:00,be Shaman Choi?
1,16,646,00:43:29:02,00:43:29:24,That is probably right.
1,16,647,00:43:31:10,00:43:34:07,But only if the Queen is a soul shifter.
1,16,648,00:43:35:09,00:43:39:08,"There was nothing to suspect
that the Queen is a soul shifter."
1,16,649,00:43:39:10,00:43:42:10,"I checked her core of energy
as I was examining her,"
1,16,650,00:43:42:12,00:43:45:10,"but she was a normal person
without extraordinary energy."
1,16,651,00:43:47:17,00:43:52:03,"She could have appeared so
if she had the ice stone."
1,16,652,00:43:53:18,00:43:57:16,"The Queen is the younger sister
of General Seo."
1,16,653,00:43:57:19,00:43:59:04,She is Yul's aunt.
1,16,654,00:43:59:06,00:44:02:21,"She is not related to the Heo family,
but she is a member of the Seo family."
1,16,655,00:44:02:23,00:44:04:09,"If her soul has been shifted,"
1,16,656,00:44:05:09,00:44:09:05,the soul in her body is someone else.
1,16,657,00:44:09:07,00:44:12:12,Is the Queen's soul dead?
1,16,658,00:44:13:01,00:44:14:13,That is not possible.
1,16,659,00:44:14:15,00:44:17:20,"Each member of the Seo Family
has a Lantern of Life."
1,16,660,00:44:19:04,00:44:22:18,"Because they guard the Seoho Fortress
near the border and go to battle often,"
1,16,661,00:44:22:20,00:44:26:16,"they each have a lantern that is lit
by the energy of their soul"
1,16,662,00:44:26:18,00:44:28:11,so they know who is alive and dead.
1,16,663,00:44:29:14,00:44:31:19,"If the Queen passed away,"
1,16,664,00:44:32:07,00:44:34:21,"they would know immediately because
her Lantern of Life would have gone off."
1,16,665,00:44:35:20,00:44:38:24,"Yes, I remember the Lantern of Life."
1,16,666,00:44:39:01,00:44:43:02,"Her soul would have been
kept alive in another body."
1,16,667,00:44:44:20,00:44:49:19,"Like Master Kang of Daegangtongun
who is lying in Sejukwon right now."
1,16,668,00:44:52:17,00:44:57:01,"Are you certain
that the Queen is a soul shifter?"
1,16,669,00:44:58:16,00:45:00:08,"If we can know for sure,"
1,16,670,00:45:01:08,00:45:04:18,"that would mean
we found Jin Mu's greatest weakness."
1,16,671,00:45:07:24,00:45:10:05,Songrim is suspecting me
1,16,672,00:45:10:07,00:45:13:06,"and they will try
to prove the Queen is a soul shifter."
1,16,673,00:45:13:08,00:45:14:21,What is there to worry about?
1,16,674,00:45:15:23,00:45:19:05,"We already have a body
for her soul to be transferred to."
1,16,675,00:45:24:10,00:45:28:08,"Can you get her into Jinyowon
without a problem?"
1,16,676,00:45:29:15,00:45:31:07,I will bring her to Jinyowon today.
1,16,677,00:45:31:24,00:45:34:05,"If everything goes to plan,"
1,16,678,00:45:34:20,00:45:37:08,Jinyowon will get their lost daughter back
1,16,679,00:45:38:00,00:45:40:13,and there will be a funeral at the palace.
1,16,680,00:45:42:14,00:45:45:19,Because the Queen will have passed away.
1,16,681,00:45:48:12,00:45:53:03,"What should we do with my old body
that the Queen's soul is occupying?"
1,16,682,00:45:55:06,00:45:58:02,"We shall take care of it
since we no longer need it alive."
1,16,683,00:46:40:16,00:46:43:21,"Your Highness,
I am here instead of Eunuch Kim today."
1,16,684,00:46:52:11,00:46:53:21,What a pity.
1,16,685,00:46:54:17,00:46:58:14,"It would be better for you
to let go of your mind."
1,16,686,00:47:20:15,00:47:22:08,This must be Gaema Village.
1,16,687,00:47:23:03,00:47:25:05,You are looking for a shaman?
1,16,688,00:47:25:07,00:47:26:07,Yes.
1,16,689,00:47:27:03,00:47:29:00,Then try Gaema Village.
1,16,690,00:47:29:14,00:47:32:23,All kinds of shamans gather there.
1,16,691,00:47:33:12,00:47:36:02,I know the oldest shaman there.
1,16,692,00:47:36:17,00:47:39:11,"If you are looking for someone, ask him."
1,16,693,00:47:42:22,00:47:44:07,"-Fire Priestess is really--
-No thank you."
1,16,694,00:47:44:09,00:47:46:10,"-Wait.
-Goodness."
1,16,695,00:47:46:12,00:47:50:12,"Excuse me, do you know
where Shaman Bong's house is?"
1,16,696,00:47:50:14,00:47:51:22,Shaman Bong?
1,16,697,00:47:51:24,00:47:54:06,He does not have powers anymore.
1,16,698,00:47:54:08,00:47:55:24,"You should go to
the Fire Priestess instead."
1,16,699,00:47:56:02,00:47:58:22,"-I will take you there.
-No, I am looking for Shaman Bong."
1,16,700,00:47:58:23,00:48:01:24,"-I told you, he is not good.
-No, it has to be Shaman Bong."
1,16,701,00:48:02:23,00:48:03:23,Thank you.
1,16,702,00:48:16:01,00:48:18:00,Where am I?
1,16,703,00:48:18:14,00:48:20:16,All of the streets look the same.
1,16,704,00:48:24:10,00:48:27:09,"I never said
I wanted to see the Fire Priestess."
1,16,705,00:48:27:11,00:48:30:04,"You still have to pay
if you had your fortune read."
1,16,706,00:48:30:07,00:48:32:17,"-Where are you going?
-Hey, do not touch me."
1,16,707,00:48:33:05,00:48:35:11,"She did not get a single thing right.
Why should I pay?"
1,16,708,00:48:41:22,00:48:43:15,Did you go and see Shaman Bong?
1,16,709,00:48:43:17,00:48:45:00,"He is bad, is he not?"
1,16,710,00:48:45:02,00:48:48:01,"The Fire Priestess is the real deal.
Am I right?"
1,16,711,00:48:48:03,00:48:49:19,"""Fire Priestess,"" my foot."
1,16,712,00:48:49:21,00:48:50:23,Come on.
1,16,713,00:48:53:23,00:48:54:19,My goodness…
1,16,714,00:48:56:01,00:48:58:10,Did you come to get your fortune read?
1,16,715,00:48:59:09,00:49:01:10,"How about you?
Did you come for an exorcism?"
1,16,716,00:49:02:00,00:49:04:20,"What did Fire Priestess say
to make you so angry?"
1,16,717,00:49:05:11,00:49:08:22,"She said I have no luck in government
and I should get into business."
1,16,718,00:49:08:24,00:49:10:08,I am the Crown Prince.
1,16,719,00:49:11:20,00:49:13:13,What did Shaman Bong say to you?
1,16,720,00:49:13:15,00:49:15:23,"I am on my way to see him.
I have many questions for him."
1,16,721,00:49:18:18,00:49:19:19,Jang Uk.
1,16,722,00:49:22:23,00:49:25:04,Are you looking for Eunuch Kim too?
1,16,723,00:49:28:10,00:49:30:08,Why are you looking for him here?
1,16,724,00:49:34:01,00:49:37:09,"He disappeared from the palace
since that day at Cheonbugwan."
1,16,725,00:49:38:05,00:49:40:04,His traces led me here.
1,16,726,00:49:40:06,00:49:43:15,So you came here alone without any guards?
1,16,727,00:49:45:09,00:49:47:05,I do not want anyone to know
1,16,728,00:49:48:04,00:49:49:22,that I am suspecting them.
1,16,729,00:49:52:23,00:49:54:24,"So you agree that
Eunuch Kim is a soul shifter"
1,16,730,00:49:56:01,00:49:58:23,"and that the Queen is being
suspicious by trying to cover it up?"
1,16,731,00:50:00:21,00:50:01:24,That is right.
1,16,732,00:50:03:04,00:50:05:03,"Why are you here?
What are you looking for?"
1,16,733,00:50:05:19,00:50:08:15,"I think there are overlaps in
what we are looking for."
1,16,734,00:50:08:17,00:50:09:22,Shall we exchange information?
1,16,735,00:50:10:17,00:50:12:00,Share one piece of information each?
1,16,736,00:50:12:20,00:50:14:20,Fine. You go first.
1,16,737,00:50:14:22,00:50:16:20,"If I tell you first,"
1,16,738,00:50:16:22,00:50:19:14,"you will not share yours,
saying, ""I am the Crown Prince."""
1,16,739,00:50:19:17,00:50:20:16,How did you know that?
1,16,740,00:50:22:14,00:50:23:14,Fine.
1,16,741,00:50:25:04,00:50:28:20,"While I was searching for Eunuch Kim,
I found something strange."
1,16,742,00:50:28:22,00:50:31:11,"It seems he left the palace every month
to go somewhere."
1,16,743,00:50:32:05,00:50:34:14,"The place he visited every month
was Gaema Village."
1,16,744,00:50:35:09,00:50:37:13,I am looking for Shaman Choi.
1,16,745,00:50:38:02,00:50:39:00,Who is that?
1,16,746,00:50:39:02,00:50:41:14,"That is for the next time.
Now if you excuse me…"
1,16,747,00:50:42:10,00:50:43:15,Wait.
1,16,748,00:50:44:17,00:50:47:20,"What am I supposed to glean
from that kind of information?"
1,16,749,00:50:47:22,00:50:49:16,I do not have much information yet.
1,16,750,00:50:52:12,00:50:55:12,"-Why are you following me?
-To meet Shaman Bong."
1,16,751,00:50:55:14,00:50:57:05,We do not have to go together.
1,16,752,00:50:57:07,00:51:00:16,"I can go afterward
and get him to tell me what he told you."
1,16,753,00:51:01:07,00:51:02:10,I am the Crown Prince.
1,16,754,00:51:07:18,00:51:10:22,"-I do not know where he is.
-You do know."
1,16,755,00:51:10:24,00:51:12:11,I really have no idea.
1,16,756,00:51:15:09,00:51:20:10,I have met your uncle and your mother.
1,16,757,00:51:20:12,00:51:22:07,What did she say?
1,16,758,00:51:22:09,00:51:24:18,Is she still very angry at me?
1,16,759,00:51:25:15,00:51:27:16,Will he really cast me out?
1,16,760,00:51:28:24,00:51:33:05,"They said they will forgive you
if you submit a signed letter."
1,16,761,00:51:33:07,00:51:36:03,"A signed letter swearing
never to see each other again."
1,16,762,00:51:39:12,00:51:40:08,Here you go.
1,16,763,00:51:42:14,00:51:44:01,The words are already written
1,16,764,00:51:44:03,00:51:46:08,so all you have to do is sign each copy
1,16,765,00:51:46:10,00:51:48:05,and you will be able to return home.
1,16,766,00:51:48:19,00:51:50:13,"You can discuss it
before making your decision."
1,16,767,00:51:51:08,00:51:55:07,"As for me, I am willing to provide
food and shelter for a while"
1,16,768,00:51:55:10,00:51:58:10,if you insist on staying together.
1,16,769,00:51:58:12,00:51:59:08,Please excuse me.
1,16,770,00:52:10:18,00:52:11:24,Cho-yeon…
1,16,771,00:52:17:00,00:52:18:04,"To tell you the truth,"
1,16,772,00:52:21:12,00:52:23:06,I slightly regretted it.
1,16,773,00:52:26:00,00:52:28:02,I was scared that I may have acted
1,16,774,00:52:30:13,00:52:32:01,rather impulsively.
1,16,775,00:52:35:21,00:52:37:02,But…
1,16,776,00:52:43:13,00:52:45:16,the thought of never seeing you again…
1,16,777,00:52:48:17,00:52:50:11,I do not care about anything else.
1,16,778,00:52:52:12,00:52:54:05,I cannot sign this letter.
1,16,779,00:52:54:07,00:52:55:23,I cannot live without seeing you.
1,16,780,00:52:58:06,00:53:00:09,"JIN CHO-YEON OF JINYOWON SWEARS NEVER
TO SEE PARK DANG-GU OF SONGRIM AGAIN"
1,16,781,00:53:01:06,00:53:03:10,I was also annoyed at first.
1,16,782,00:53:06:11,00:53:08:07,But I want to keep seeing you.
1,16,783,00:53:44:16,00:53:46:15,The negotiation is off.
1,16,784,00:53:46:18,00:53:49:13,"Set the table, Mu-deok."
1,16,785,00:53:56:01,00:53:57:22,Have some fish.
1,16,786,00:54:04:08,00:54:05:22,Have some meat as well.
1,16,787,00:54:17:24,00:54:22:01,Are you two really going to stay here?
1,16,788,00:54:22:03,00:54:23:08,Yes.
1,16,789,00:54:23:10,00:54:27:12,"We are going to go home
and bring our belongings."
1,16,790,00:54:27:14,00:54:30:08,"So you will build
your honeymoon nest here?"
1,16,791,00:54:33:10,00:54:34:16,"It is not like that,"
1,16,792,00:54:34:18,00:54:36:15,but we at least need a change of clothes.
1,16,793,00:54:36:17,00:54:39:10,"Could you go with her
and carry her luggage back?"
1,16,794,00:54:50:05,00:54:51:22,"Did you throw away the paper
that was here?"
1,16,795,00:54:52:12,00:54:53:08,I was about to throw them out.
1,16,796,00:55:00:15,00:55:01:15,"JIN CHO-YEON OF JINYOWON SWEARS NEVER
TO SEE PARK DANG-GU OF SONGRIM AGAIN"
1,16,797,00:55:01:17,00:55:03:06,I need to think it over.
1,16,798,00:55:04:11,00:55:07:16,"If I pack up and leave,
I really might get kicked out."
1,16,799,00:55:09:19,00:55:11:02,Did you get hurt?
1,16,800,00:55:13:08,00:55:14:13,Does it hurt?
1,16,801,00:55:15:02,00:55:16:15,"Of course, it does."
1,16,802,00:55:21:19,00:55:22:20,You have a scar.
1,16,803,00:55:22:22,00:55:24:11,How did you get that?
1,16,804,00:55:25:03,00:55:26:11,I have no idea.
1,16,805,00:55:26:13,00:55:28:15,"It was when I was young,
so I do not remember."
1,16,806,00:55:29:15,00:55:31:15,That is a scar from a laceration.
1,16,807,00:55:31:17,00:55:34:19,"My sister had one in the same place
because of me."
1,16,808,00:55:36:03,00:55:39:01,She fell exactly like you did just now.
1,16,809,00:55:46:21,00:55:49:08,A scar formed on the cut.
1,16,810,00:55:54:06,00:55:55:17,This will do.
1,16,811,00:55:57:13,00:56:00:17,"I will do my best, Father."
1,16,812,00:56:03:02,00:56:05:05,"Do not call me that
unless it is necessary."
1,16,813,00:56:06:11,00:56:07:20,It makes my skin crawl.
1,16,814,00:56:17:08,00:56:19:22,Did he have to be so rude about it?
1,16,815,00:56:20:15,00:56:23:16,"Why did he throw away
such a beautiful silk handkerchief?"
1,16,816,00:56:25:07,00:56:26:09,Wait.
1,16,817,00:56:34:12,00:56:37:01,It has the same design as Mu-deok's.
1,16,818,00:56:41:08,00:56:43:20,"-Did the lord from Jinyowon leave?
-Yes."
1,16,819,00:56:46:19,00:56:48:07,What is this design?
1,16,820,00:56:48:10,00:56:51:04,It is the crest of the Jin family.
1,16,821,00:56:51:22,00:56:54:00,You will go there today. Get ready.
1,16,822,00:56:54:17,00:56:55:21,Right.
1,16,823,00:56:58:15,00:57:00:10,Is that what this was?
1,16,824,00:57:09:00,00:57:11:15,Why would Mu-deok have something
1,16,825,00:57:11:17,00:57:14:02,with the crest of Jinyowon on it?
1,16,826,00:57:21:15,00:57:24:02,"You have to get my things
without my mother finding out."
1,16,827,00:57:24:04,00:57:25:07,Follow me.
1,16,828,00:57:26:13,00:57:29:03,I wish she would just go in and stay.
1,16,829,00:57:37:05,00:57:40:03,"Can this man really be believed?
He seems like a hack."
1,16,830,00:57:40:23,00:57:42:19,He must be something.
1,16,831,00:57:43:09,00:57:47:05,"You are both piping hot.
You have shared something."
1,16,832,00:57:47:19,00:57:48:24,Are you perchance lovers?
1,16,833,00:57:51:06,00:57:52:16,"-No way.
-No."
1,16,834,00:57:54:18,00:57:57:23,"It is my business policy
never to breach confidentiality."
1,16,835,00:57:58:00,00:57:59:16,You can rest assured.
1,16,836,00:57:59:19,00:58:04:12,"The two of you have already shared
something very meaningful, right?"
1,16,837,00:58:06:00,00:58:06:22,He is good.
1,16,838,00:58:08:06,00:58:09:04,Come on.
1,16,839,00:58:11:09,00:58:14:05,"I heard you have been
in Gaema Village the longest."
1,16,840,00:58:14:07,00:58:16:17,Do you happen to know Shaman Choi?
1,16,841,00:58:19:24,00:58:21:06,Shaman Choi?
1,16,842,00:58:21:08,00:58:24:06,Are you mages patrolling for sorcery?
1,16,843,00:58:27:15,00:58:31:19,"It is nothing like that.
I just heard she was very good."
1,16,844,00:58:31:22,00:58:33:19,I just want to find her because of that.
1,16,845,00:58:37:08,00:58:38:13,"Yes, she was."
1,16,846,00:58:39:03,00:58:41:01,It was already over 20 years ago.
1,16,847,00:58:48:12,00:58:49:20,Shaman Choi was famous
1,16,848,00:58:49:22,00:58:53:21,for her sorcery that put hexes on people.
1,16,849,00:58:54:11,00:58:56:10,"One day, she almost got caught"
1,16,850,00:58:56:12,00:59:00:09,"by the mages from Cheonbugwan
who were cracking down on sorcery."
1,16,851,00:59:01:07,00:59:02:20,But she jumped into a fire.
1,16,852,00:59:05:02,00:59:08:15,Some say she died in that fire.
1,16,853,00:59:09:07,00:59:13:05,"Others say she was burnt badly
but survived."
1,16,854,00:59:13:22,00:59:15:00,That was when
1,16,855,00:59:15:02,00:59:18:00,"your father Jang Gang
was the Gwanju of Cheonbugwan."
1,16,856,00:59:20:20,00:59:23:23,"If Shaman Choi was hunted
by the mages of Cheonbugwan,"
1,16,857,00:59:25:01,00:59:27:10,"are you seeking her because
she bears a grudge against your father?"
1,16,858,00:59:27:12,00:59:29:19,I do not even remember my father.
1,16,859,00:59:30:10,00:59:32:15,"How can I know
who bears a grudge against him?"
1,16,860,00:59:36:04,00:59:39:05,"PARK DANG-GU OF SONGRIM SWEARS NEVER
TO SEE JIN CHO-YEON OF JINYOWON AGAIN"
1,16,861,00:59:41:09,00:59:43:15,You did not sign the paper.
1,16,862,00:59:43:17,00:59:46:06,"I thought about signing the paper
and coming back home,"
1,16,863,00:59:47:04,00:59:49:06,but that would be lying.
1,16,864,00:59:49:08,00:59:51:07,I cannot live without seeing her.
1,16,865,00:59:54:12,00:59:57:01,This did not happen overnight.
1,16,866,00:59:57:23,01:00:01:01,"I was in love with her for a long time,
but could not express it for a long time."
1,16,867,01:00:01:03,01:00:03:02,I was only able to take her hand now.
1,16,868,01:00:03:17,01:00:05:04,Please do not call us childish
1,16,869,01:00:05:06,01:00:07:20,and give us a chance.
1,16,870,01:00:07:22,01:00:10:04,Take your bundle of belongings
1,16,871,01:00:10:06,01:00:11:22,and go to Uk's home.
1,16,872,01:00:12:22,01:00:14:15,"-Uncle…
-I need you"
1,16,873,01:00:15:13,01:00:17:01,to do something there.
1,16,874,01:00:26:19,01:00:28:17,"If this person comes to his house,"
1,16,875,01:00:28:19,01:00:30:11,let me know immediately.
1,16,876,01:00:30:13,01:00:32:14,Who is this?
1,16,877,01:00:33:18,01:00:35:14,Gwanju Jang Gang of Cheonbugwan.
1,16,878,01:00:36:08,01:00:37:14,He is Uk's father.
1,16,879,01:00:41:05,01:00:42:20,"If he comes,"
1,16,880,01:00:44:19,01:00:46:00,let me know
1,16,881,01:00:47:02,01:00:48:06,right away.
1,16,882,01:00:50:23,01:00:52:21,"Oh, I almost forgot."
1,16,883,01:00:52:23,01:00:56:11,Shaman Choi had a brother.
1,16,884,01:00:57:10,01:01:00:02,Do you know where he is?
1,16,885,01:01:00:04,01:01:04:08,I have not seen him since the incident.
1,16,886,01:01:04:24,01:01:08:13,But there was a rumor that
1,16,887,01:01:08:15,01:01:10:23,he married a woman from a powerful family.
1,16,888,01:01:35:15,01:01:38:14,"They said this girl
is very likely to be her."
1,16,889,01:01:39:12,01:01:41:07,Why is she wearing such ragged clothes?
1,16,890,01:01:41:10,01:01:43:21,"As a child, she washed up
along Lake Gyeongcheondaeho."
1,16,891,01:01:43:23,01:01:46:15,"She was barely alive
when the fishermen rescued her."
1,16,892,01:01:47:13,01:01:50:17,"That experience must have
caused memory loss,"
1,16,893,01:01:51:08,01:01:56:07,"but she can sense things around her
even though she is blind."
1,16,894,01:02:19:07,01:02:22:07,You have the birthmark here…
1,16,895,01:02:31:08,01:02:33:01,You have a scar in the same place.
1,16,896,01:02:34:09,01:02:39:20,"That is why they said
you are very likely to be my Bu-yeon."
1,16,897,01:02:39:23,01:02:41:10,"However,"
1,16,898,01:02:41:12,01:02:45:14,"it could still be a coincidence.
Why not test her with the surest method?"
1,16,899,01:02:52:12,01:02:54:17,Let us go and see
1,16,900,01:02:55:24,01:02:57:19,if you can open the doors of Jinyowon.
1,16,901,01:03:07:19,01:03:09:21,The Cheonbugwan people are here again.
1,16,902,01:03:09:23,01:03:12:06,"They must have brought
another girl to see if she is Bu-yeon."
1,16,903,01:03:22:07,01:03:25:17,"Since you have
Jin Cho-yeon's blood in your body,"
1,16,904,01:03:25:20,01:03:28:08,"you should be able to
move the doors of Jinyowon."
1,16,905,01:03:30:07,01:03:32:22,Try to move the doors even a little bit.
1,16,906,01:03:33:11,01:03:35:04,That should be enough.
1,16,907,01:03:45:04,01:03:47:17,"So many girls were brought here,"
1,16,908,01:03:48:10,01:03:49:21,but none of them could open the door.
1,16,909,01:04:33:07,01:04:34:11,Bu-yeon!
1,16,910,01:04:35:18,01:04:37:00,"My goodness, Bu-yeon!"
1,16,911,01:04:40:12,01:04:44:06,"It is happening again.
It happens every time I come to Jinyowon."
1,16,912,01:05:00:07,01:05:01:21,"If it was 20 years ago,"
1,16,913,01:05:02:09,01:05:05:05,"it was when Jin Mu
was your father's pupil."
1,16,914,01:05:06:09,01:05:08:16,"Jin Mu may know something.
Should I ask him?"
1,16,915,01:05:08:18,01:05:10:11,Absolutely not.
1,16,916,01:05:10:13,01:05:13:21,Please keep what you heard today a secret.
1,16,917,01:05:15:23,01:05:19:08,"What we learned today does not seem
all that important, but I will."
1,16,918,01:05:22:19,01:05:26:01,"Your Royal Highness,
did you say you came here alone?"
1,16,919,01:05:26:03,01:05:27:03,I did.
1,16,920,01:05:27:05,01:05:30:16,But it seems like someone is following us.
1,16,921,01:05:34:02,01:05:37:06,"Shall we split up
to see who he is following?"
1,16,922,01:06:17:09,01:06:18:15,Mother!
1,16,923,01:07:00:18,01:07:02:17,Who are you and why are you following me?
1,16,924,01:07:05:18,01:07:06:16,I said…
1,16,925,01:07:10:01,01:07:11:03,who are you?
