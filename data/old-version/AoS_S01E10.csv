1,10,1,00:00:39:05,00:00:43:00,"This room will be vacant
while our young master stays in Songrim."
1,10,2,00:00:43:03,00:00:45:23,Clean up his books and clothes.
1,10,3,00:00:46:00,00:00:47:07,"-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am."
1,10,4,00:00:49:18,00:00:54:04,"He had left home a dozen times
and returned every time."
1,10,5,00:00:54:14,00:00:57:05,"You should wait a few days
in case he comes back again."
1,10,6,00:00:57:22,00:00:59:07,It is different this time.
1,10,7,00:00:59:22,00:01:03:00,He is a changed man.
1,10,8,00:01:04:03,00:01:06:12,And he may bring home a wife soon.
1,10,9,00:01:07:01,00:01:08:19,That is why we need to clean up.
1,10,10,00:01:09:06,00:01:11:14,Is he getting engaged again?
1,10,11,00:01:12:09,00:01:15:21,"If this one falls through yet again,
he will never be able to get married."
1,10,12,00:01:16:07,00:01:17:21,It is different this time.
1,10,13,00:01:17:23,00:01:22:24,"Young Master Jang has a lady
he has deep feelings for."
1,10,14,00:01:24:09,00:01:25:15,"Right, Mu-deok?"
1,10,15,00:01:27:02,00:01:29:22,The bird egg that he mentioned.
1,10,16,00:01:30:18,00:01:34:23,"I believe it is that lady
I met in Songrim."
1,10,17,00:01:35:14,00:01:38:06,A bird egg on top of a tree.
1,10,18,00:01:38:08,00:01:41:01,She must be a sophisticated woman
1,10,19,00:01:41:11,00:01:43:06,whom he wants to protect.
1,10,20,00:01:43:08,00:01:46:01,She must be someone like an egret.
1,10,21,00:01:46:03,00:01:47:04,Like me.
1,10,22,00:01:47:06,00:01:48:18,Who knows?
1,10,23,00:01:49:07,00:01:54:00,"Once it hatches,
it may turn out to be a vicious eagle,"
1,10,24,00:01:54:02,00:01:56:08,not a sophisticated egret.
1,10,25,00:01:56:19,00:01:58:00,Is that so?
1,10,26,00:01:58:16,00:02:00:10,"A vicious eagle, how frightful."
1,10,27,00:02:01:01,00:02:03:11,"I hope it is not a woodpecker
or a cuckoo either."
1,10,28,00:02:03:13,00:02:05:07,Do not worry.
1,10,29,00:02:05:17,00:02:08:21,"Once it hatches,
I am sure it will fly away."
1,10,30,00:02:10:07,00:02:13:13,"How could she
when she has feelings for him?"
1,10,31,00:02:14:16,00:02:19:12,"If they were that close,
I am sure the feelings were mutual."
1,10,32,00:02:20:04,00:02:22:13,The bird must be in love with him as well.
1,10,33,00:02:25:05,00:02:27:13,I really hope it is Young Lady Heo.
1,10,34,00:02:28:06,00:02:29:24,She resembles Madam Do-hwa too.
1,10,35,00:02:32:16,00:02:33:24,"-Mr. Lee.
-Yes?"
1,10,36,00:02:34:01,00:02:36:10,"Leave those there.
They are Master Jang's books."
1,10,37,00:02:37:17,00:02:39:06,Hurry up.
1,10,38,00:02:43:01,00:02:45:08,What Uk and I shared
1,10,39,00:02:46:10,00:02:48:17,was the desperate feeling of survival
1,10,40,00:02:51:23,00:02:54:15,and the earnestness of finding ourselves.
1,10,41,00:03:04:02,00:03:06:04,"Once we got what we wanted,"
1,10,42,00:03:07:09,00:03:10:04,"we promised to part ways
without looking back."
1,10,43,00:03:12:20,00:03:15:05,The love that Maidservant Kim mentioned
1,10,44,00:03:17:13,00:03:19:22,may have seeped in between us.
1,10,45,00:03:20:20,00:03:25:16,"But it is nothing but a shell
that I will leave behind once I hatch."
1,10,46,00:03:47:16,00:03:50:23,"You have already memorized
and written all of this down?"
1,10,47,00:03:51:00,00:03:54:24,"Yes, please feel free to check.
I am certain I memorized everything."
1,10,48,00:03:57:18,00:03:58:22,"Even so,"
1,10,49,00:03:58:24,00:04:01:06,it should have taken you at least a month.
1,10,50,00:04:01:08,00:04:05:04,"I have served 12 masters so far
and thus have read the same book 12 times."
1,10,51,00:04:05:15,00:04:06:18,You could say
1,10,52,00:04:06:20,00:04:09:05,"that this task was a piece of cake,
to say the least."
1,10,53,00:04:09:07,00:04:12:17,"I was wondering
why he agreed to obey the rules."
1,10,54,00:04:12:19,00:04:14:08,He had his reasons.
1,10,55,00:04:14:10,00:04:17:21,"Now that I can leave Songrim
whenever I want, I will go home."
1,10,56,00:04:18:07,00:04:19:16,Not so fast.
1,10,57,00:04:27:11,00:04:29:01,Why not?
1,10,58,00:04:29:03,00:04:32:06,"The rules say that I can leave
once I master the basic education."
1,10,59,00:04:32:08,00:04:34:13,"When I asked you to read that,"
1,10,60,00:04:34:15,00:04:36:16,I did not simply mean to memorize it.
1,10,61,00:04:36:18,00:04:38:20,I wanted you to engrave it in your heart.
1,10,62,00:04:39:12,00:04:41:19,"But since you were sly enough
to deceive us,"
1,10,63,00:04:41:21,00:04:45:07,"I do not believe
that you have mastered this learning."
1,10,64,00:04:46:18,00:04:48:07,I did not know
1,10,65,00:04:48:21,00:04:51:22,"that the leader could change
Songrim's rules however he wanted."
1,10,66,00:04:53:05,00:04:54:04,Here you go.
1,10,67,00:04:54:18,00:04:56:20,I have another task for you.
1,10,68,00:04:57:06,00:04:59:16,"If you read this book as well,"
1,10,69,00:05:01:02,00:05:04:07,"then I will allow you
to leave Songrim whenever you wish."
1,10,70,00:05:07:17,00:05:09:03,No!
1,10,71,00:05:16:12,00:05:18:12,Are you sure that I can go outside
1,10,72,00:05:19:15,00:05:21:01,after reading this book?
1,10,73,00:05:21:03,00:05:22:09,That is right.
1,10,74,00:05:23:01,00:05:26:00,I hope reading this book
1,10,75,00:05:26:15,00:05:29:08,will be another piece of cake for you.
1,10,76,00:05:30:16,00:05:32:08,This is terrible.
1,10,77,00:05:32:10,00:05:34:22,"Mu-deok will not be able
to see Uk for a while."
1,10,78,00:05:48:09,00:05:50:05,What? This is empty.
1,10,79,00:05:52:11,00:05:56:16,"No, it is not.
There are words written on those papers."
1,10,80,00:05:57:19,00:05:58:19,"No, there are not."
1,10,81,00:05:58:21,00:06:00:12,Do you see anything here?
1,10,82,00:06:01:18,00:06:03:08,It is you who cannot see.
1,10,83,00:06:04:02,00:06:06:16,"You can only read it
once you focus your energy."
1,10,84,00:06:06:18,00:06:09:09,"That is Master Seo Gyeong's book,
Words of the Heart,"
1,10,85,00:06:12:23,00:06:14:01,I see.
1,10,86,00:06:14:21,00:06:17:17,So there are actual words on these papers?
1,10,87,00:06:17:19,00:06:20:16,So I am the only one who cannot read it?
1,10,88,00:06:25:14,00:06:27:14,"Your friend, Uk,"
1,10,89,00:06:27:16,00:06:29:10,must have not known what that book was.
1,10,90,00:06:29:12,00:06:33:01,"He has never received proper training.
Of course he would not know."
1,10,91,00:06:33:03,00:06:35:00,He will be stuck in the Training Center
1,10,92,00:06:35:02,00:06:36:17,until he can read it.
1,10,93,00:06:37:06,00:06:38:10,I feel bad for him.
1,10,94,00:06:38:13,00:06:40:13,"He will probably
be stuck there for half a year."
1,10,95,00:06:41:11,00:06:43:21,"Even six months
would be too short for him."
1,10,96,00:06:43:23,00:06:47:13,"He mastered Ryusu
due to pure luck, not training."
1,10,97,00:06:48:08,00:06:50:22,It will take him more than a year.
1,10,98,00:06:59:20,00:07:02:11,"How do you know that
when you were never given that book?"
1,10,99,00:07:02:13,00:07:05:10,"I know you need
ample training to read that book."
1,10,100,00:07:05:12,00:07:08:04,Then know that he is far ahead of you.
1,10,101,00:07:08:19,00:07:10:14,"Unlike him who received that book,"
1,10,102,00:07:11:06,00:07:12:19,you have not touched it yet.
1,10,103,00:07:17:19,00:07:20:13,He is right. You should not gossip.
1,10,104,00:07:20:15,00:07:21:20,Bye.
1,10,105,00:07:23:08,00:07:24:17,Darn it.
1,10,106,00:07:29:14,00:07:32:05,"I wonder why my uncle
gave him that book already."
1,10,107,00:07:33:17,00:07:34:23,I am baffled as well.
1,10,108,00:07:35:00,00:07:38:23,"He will not be able to do anything
while he is stuck there."
1,10,109,00:07:45:15,00:07:46:21,I have
1,10,110,00:07:47:15,00:07:49:20,no intention of training Uk.
1,10,111,00:07:50:07,00:07:53:15,"I am going to keep him near me
and check up on him"
1,10,112,00:07:53:18,00:07:56:13,"so that he will not cause
any trouble outside."
1,10,113,00:07:56:16,00:08:01:17,"So you did not take him under your wing.
You just locked him up in Songrim."
1,10,114,00:08:03:04,00:08:05:20,"Since Uk has entered Songrim with a fuss,"
1,10,115,00:08:06:05,00:08:07:21,his father will be coming.
1,10,116,00:08:07:23,00:08:10:00,"By ""father"", do you mean Jang Gang?"
1,10,117,00:08:10:02,00:08:13:06,"Jang Gang's biggest fear
was that Uk's gate of energy would be open"
1,10,118,00:08:14:16,00:08:17:12,and that he would go out into the open.
1,10,119,00:08:17:22,00:08:19:11,"Once he gets wind of this,"
1,10,120,00:08:20:05,00:08:22:02,he will come.
1,10,121,00:08:22:04,00:08:26:16,"The Gwanju needs to return
in order to get rid of Jin Mu."
1,10,122,00:08:27:18,00:08:29:20,Everything will be solved
1,10,123,00:08:31:03,00:08:33:11,once he returns.
1,10,124,00:08:34:23,00:08:37:04,I feel bad for Uk.
1,10,125,00:08:37:21,00:08:39:19,He came this far
1,10,126,00:08:39:21,00:08:42:02,without receiving any training.
1,10,127,00:08:42:04,00:08:43:14,How can he read Words of the Heart?
1,10,128,00:08:43:16,00:08:45:01,It is an impossible task.
1,10,129,00:08:53:10,00:08:56:00,Why would you give him these snacks?
1,10,130,00:08:56:19,00:08:58:18,"I heard some things
about Young Master Jang."
1,10,131,00:08:58:20,00:09:01:03,"He has a complicated family history,
barely any skills,"
1,10,132,00:09:01:05,00:09:03:16,"-and a terrible personality.
-That is not true."
1,10,133,00:09:05:17,00:09:06:21,He is a good man.
1,10,134,00:09:06:24,00:09:09:01,Why would you think that?
1,10,135,00:09:09:03,00:09:10:16,He is so fussy
1,10,136,00:09:10:18,00:09:14:03,"that the only person who can put up
with him is the maid Mu-deok."
1,10,137,00:09:16:05,00:09:17:19,"-Mu-deok?
-Yes."
1,10,138,00:09:17:21,00:09:20:24,She is the maid who is always by his side.
1,10,139,00:09:25:24,00:09:27:07,Mu-deok.
1,10,140,00:09:27:20,00:09:30:12,I heard you stayed by my side all night.
1,10,141,00:09:30:14,00:09:33:21,"I thought you were Mu-deok.
I apologize for the trouble."
1,10,142,00:09:35:06,00:09:38:02,So that is why he thought I was her.
1,10,143,00:09:44:02,00:09:45:08,Hello.
1,10,144,00:09:47:09,00:09:48:23,We are from Sejukwon.
1,10,145,00:09:49:16,00:09:51:06,"This way, my lady."
1,10,146,00:10:29:02,00:10:31:14,Wait. The fire…
1,10,147,00:10:57:17,00:10:58:17,Here you go.
1,10,148,00:10:58:19,00:11:00:14,I have another task for you.
1,10,149,00:11:05:20,00:11:07:02,He deceived me.
1,10,150,00:11:07:04,00:11:09:06,He did a number on me!
1,10,151,00:11:26:06,00:11:28:02,"Hey, we meet again."
1,10,152,00:11:28:04,00:11:31:23,Hello. Are you going somewhere?
1,10,153,00:11:32:00,00:11:34:13,"Well, yes. I need to meet someone outside."
1,10,154,00:11:35:17,00:11:37:18,But why are you leaving that way?
1,10,155,00:11:39:21,00:11:41:08,Because I am running away.
1,10,156,00:11:43:06,00:11:46:03,Please turn a blind eye to this as well.
1,10,157,00:11:49:12,00:11:53:19,"My gosh. Young Lady Heo is so impatient.
Why did she not wait for me?"
1,10,158,00:11:53:21,00:11:56:09,Why did she leave me behind?
1,10,159,00:12:00:21,00:12:02:09,What is the matter?
1,10,160,00:12:03:21,00:12:05:13,Is Jang Uk not in his room?
1,10,161,00:12:05:24,00:12:07:17,"Yes, he is."
1,10,162,00:12:08:04,00:12:09:12,Let us go upstairs then.
1,10,163,00:12:09:15,00:12:13:07,I need to talk to him.
1,10,164,00:12:13:09,00:12:15:06,"In private, please."
1,10,165,00:12:17:15,00:12:20:23,This will take some time. Wait outside.
1,10,166,00:12:40:15,00:12:43:14,"Mu-deok, the young master
from Songrim is here."
1,10,167,00:12:43:16,00:12:45:08,He is looking for you.
1,10,168,00:13:02:21,00:13:04:16,"Hello, Young Master Seo."
1,10,169,00:13:07:02,00:13:08:24,You must have been expecting Uk.
1,10,170,00:13:10:19,00:13:12:24,He will not be back for some time.
1,10,171,00:13:13:15,00:13:15:17,He was given a difficult task to complete.
1,10,172,00:13:16:07,00:13:17:23,He will do well.
1,10,173,00:13:18:16,00:13:20:22,It is most crucial for him to remain there
1,10,174,00:13:21:08,00:13:23:24,and receive training as of now.
1,10,175,00:13:24:14,00:13:27:18,"I was concerned after how you left
that day, but you look fine."
1,10,176,00:13:28:16,00:13:30:16,What have you been doing?
1,10,177,00:13:31:06,00:13:35:03,"I am just a maid here,
so I have been doing housework."
1,10,178,00:13:35:19,00:13:37:24,Maidservant Kim is away at the moment.
1,10,179,00:13:38:01,00:13:39:18,You can wait in the study.
1,10,180,00:13:40:03,00:13:42:01,"I am here to see you, not her."
1,10,181,00:13:43:22,00:13:45:02,Me?
1,10,182,00:13:45:16,00:13:48:12,Why would you want to see me?
1,10,183,00:13:49:04,00:13:50:08,Well…
1,10,184,00:13:50:20,00:13:52:04,The umbrella.
1,10,185,00:13:52:23,00:13:56:21,"I came to get the umbrella
I had lent you that day."
1,10,186,00:13:58:02,00:13:59:11,That umbrella?
1,10,187,00:13:59:13,00:14:02:12,"The wind tore it open
on my way home, so I threw it away."
1,10,188,00:14:03:18,00:14:04:21,Is that so?
1,10,189,00:14:07:01,00:14:08:04,Then let us go.
1,10,190,00:14:08:18,00:14:09:13,What?
1,10,191,00:14:09:16,00:14:11:05,We should get a new one.
1,10,192,00:14:11:07,00:14:14:02,You need to buy me a new umbrella.
1,10,193,00:14:16:14,00:14:19:12,UMBRELLAS
1,10,194,00:14:22:15,00:14:25:11,"This looks exactly like
the umbrella you lent me."
1,10,195,00:14:25:13,00:14:27:01,That is made of low-quality…
1,10,196,00:14:28:19,00:14:31:02,"That is a disposable umbrella
made of low-quality paper."
1,10,197,00:14:31:05,00:14:33:13,"Mine was made
from high-quality sheepskin and bamboo."
1,10,198,00:14:34:23,00:14:36:13,"High-quality, you say?"
1,10,199,00:14:37:02,00:14:39:09,"Why did you give a maid
such an expensive umbrella?"
1,10,200,00:14:39:11,00:14:41:09,I had only lent it to you.
1,10,201,00:14:41:11,00:14:43:19,You should compensate for losing it.
1,10,202,00:14:46:08,00:14:48:14,And that was my one and only umbrella.
1,10,203,00:14:48:16,00:14:51:20,"Why would a young master like you
only have one umbrella?"
1,10,204,00:14:51:22,00:14:54:04,I rarely go out when it is raining.
1,10,205,00:14:55:05,00:14:59:07,"I had hurt my leg as a child,
and it still hurts when it rains."
1,10,206,00:15:00:07,00:15:03:14,Is your broken leg still giving you pain?
1,10,207,00:15:07:17,00:15:10:19,"Young Master Park told me
about how you had broken your leg."
1,10,208,00:15:12:00,00:15:13:21,"Yes, back in Danhyanggok."
1,10,209,00:15:13:23,00:15:17:18,"I pity you for being a mage
who has a weak leg."
1,10,210,00:15:18:09,00:15:20:23,Your leg probably did not heal properly.
1,10,211,00:15:23:05,00:15:24:16,There was a friend
1,10,212,00:15:25:09,00:15:27:20,who used to wait for me in Danhyanggok.
1,10,213,00:15:30:06,00:15:32:15,She saved me and treated my wound.
1,10,214,00:15:33:18,00:15:36:03,My leg must not have healed properly
1,10,215,00:15:37:12,00:15:39:06,because I had not thanked her.
1,10,216,00:15:52:15,00:15:54:15,"-I like this one.
-Pardon?"
1,10,217,00:15:54:17,00:15:56:23,I will take this one. Go and pay for it.
1,10,218,00:15:58:22,00:16:00:07,"Yes, Young Master Seo."
1,10,219,00:16:04:24,00:16:06:12,"-We will take this one.
-All right."
1,10,220,00:16:06:14,00:16:09:05,Please put it on Master Jang Gang's tab.
1,10,221,00:16:09:15,00:16:12:16,"Why would you do that?
You should pay for it."
1,10,222,00:16:13:03,00:16:15:13,A maid like me has no money.
1,10,223,00:16:15:16,00:16:17:01,"Of course, you do."
1,10,224,00:16:17:09,00:16:19:00,I saw you go out
1,10,225,00:16:19:02,00:16:21:09,"and buy clothes
with the money you keep hidden."
1,10,226,00:16:21:12,00:16:23:00,That was because…
1,10,227,00:16:27:18,00:16:30:14,"-How much is it?
-You have a good eye."
1,10,228,00:16:30:16,00:16:33:06,That is our most expensive umbrella.
1,10,229,00:16:38:11,00:16:39:17,Darn it.
1,10,230,00:16:45:01,00:16:46:10,Mu-deok is not here?
1,10,231,00:16:47:10,00:16:50:07,"Why did she have to be away
now of all times?"
1,10,232,00:16:50:09,00:16:53:01,"Young Master Jang,
were you kicked out again?"
1,10,233,00:16:53:11,00:16:55:24,"No, I was not.
I only stopped by for a minute."
1,10,234,00:16:56:01,00:16:57:22,I will be going back soon.
1,10,235,00:16:57:24,00:16:58:20,I see.
1,10,236,00:16:58:22,00:17:00:22,Mu-deok will be here soon.
1,10,237,00:17:01:07,00:17:03:23,"Should I prepare a bath for you
in the meantime?"
1,10,238,00:17:04:12,00:17:05:09,That sounds nice.
1,10,239,00:17:05:12,00:17:07:22,"It has been a while
since I last bathed in this house."
1,10,240,00:17:07:24,00:17:10:07,"-I will get it ready then.
-Sure."
1,10,241,00:17:26:02,00:17:27:13,Hold on.
1,10,242,00:17:28:14,00:17:30:23,Were our honey biscuits always this sweet?
1,10,243,00:17:33:00,00:17:35:13,Why does Songrim not have any snacks?
1,10,244,00:17:35:24,00:17:38:06,"Our leader also had a sweet tooth
back in the day."
1,10,245,00:17:55:07,00:17:59:08,Are we breaking up today?
1,10,246,00:18:00:02,00:18:01:17,Yes.
1,10,247,00:18:02:03,00:18:05:04,"The three big-mouthed sisters will be done
with their floriculture class"
1,10,248,00:18:05:06,00:18:06:15,and will pass us by soon.
1,10,249,00:18:07:01,00:18:09:08,"If we argue in front of them then,"
1,10,250,00:18:09:10,00:18:12:05,they will gossip about how we broke up.
1,10,251,00:18:17:23,00:18:19:12,"As I promised,"
1,10,252,00:18:19:14,00:18:22:04,I will be the reason for our breakup.
1,10,253,00:18:22:16,00:18:25:01,"First, slap me hard across my face."
1,10,254,00:18:25:03,00:18:28:02,"Then push me away
when I cling onto you and leave."
1,10,255,00:18:28:13,00:18:30:14,That seems a bit extreme…
1,10,256,00:18:30:16,00:18:32:08,We have to go that far
1,10,257,00:18:32:11,00:18:35:11,"for them to believe
that we really broke off our engagement."
1,10,258,00:18:35:13,00:18:39:00,Then people will bad-mouth you.
1,10,259,00:18:39:02,00:18:42:19,"There will be no matchmaking for you
if you have a bad reputation."
1,10,260,00:18:45:13,00:18:46:21,I do not wish
1,10,261,00:18:47:10,00:18:49:15,to get married by matchmaking.
1,10,262,00:18:53:02,00:18:54:22,I will marry the woman
1,10,263,00:18:55:22,00:18:57:06,who I like.
1,10,264,00:19:05:21,00:19:07:08,"Still, slapping is too much."
1,10,265,00:19:08:14,00:19:11:07,I will pour this on you instead.
1,10,266,00:19:11:18,00:19:14:20,Sure. You can do that.
1,10,267,00:19:18:02,00:19:19:19,The tea is too hot.
1,10,268,00:19:20:19,00:19:23:01,Your face will burn.
1,10,269,00:19:28:06,00:19:29:21,Goodness.
1,10,270,00:19:30:13,00:19:31:23,It is fine.
1,10,271,00:19:33:22,00:19:37:11,There will be a magic show in a few days.
1,10,272,00:19:39:00,00:19:40:22,I really wanted to watch it.
1,10,273,00:19:41:11,00:19:44:12,"But I will not be able to
if we break up today."
1,10,274,00:19:44:24,00:19:47:05,Wait. Why not?
1,10,275,00:19:47:07,00:19:51:07,"Up until now,
I stayed home for at least a month"
1,10,276,00:19:52:01,00:19:54:13,after breaking off an engagement.
1,10,277,00:19:55:19,00:19:58:08,I see.
1,10,278,00:20:01:24,00:20:06:04,"Then should we postpone
our breakup for a few days?"
1,10,279,00:20:06:06,00:20:07:05,Should we?
1,10,280,00:20:10:04,00:20:13:11,But those three sisters will be there too.
1,10,281,00:20:14:03,00:20:17:17,I do not think I should go there alone.
1,10,282,00:20:18:13,00:20:22:09,"Then since they think
we are a couple, I will go with you."
1,10,283,00:20:24:12,00:20:26:24,"Well, I suppose."
1,10,284,00:20:31:20,00:20:34:14,"I would like
some pumpkin taffy, rice taffy,"
1,10,285,00:20:34:16,00:20:36:17,and honey biscuits.
1,10,286,00:20:36:19,00:20:38:02,Sure.
1,10,287,00:20:39:14,00:20:41:16,My young master is like a child.
1,10,288,00:20:41:18,00:20:44:00,"He gets cranky
when there are no snacks around."
1,10,289,00:20:44:19,00:20:46:03,Please give them to him.
1,10,290,00:20:48:24,00:20:51:07,I like these pine pollen tea snacks.
1,10,291,00:20:51:09,00:20:54:00,"I suspected you would have
expensive tastes."
1,10,292,00:20:54:02,00:20:56:15,"-Would you like some of that too?
-No, thank you."
1,10,293,00:21:07:19,00:21:10:02,RECRUITING SERVANTS FOR SONGRIM
1,10,294,00:21:11:23,00:21:13:08,RECRUITING SERVANTS FOR SONGRIM
1,10,295,00:21:13:10,00:21:16:13,"QUALIFICATIONS: HEALTHY, LITERATE,
CAN CALCULATE, NO CRIMINAL RECORD"
1,10,296,00:21:18:21,00:21:21:02,I will put this on the Jang family's tab.
1,10,297,00:21:27:10,00:21:29:05,Please give these to Young Master Jang.
1,10,298,00:21:30:05,00:21:33:23,"I have some business
to take care of. Goodbye."
1,10,299,00:21:50:22,00:21:51:23,Here you go.
1,10,300,00:21:52:00,00:21:53:14,"-Have a look around.
-I will."
1,10,301,00:21:54:05,00:21:55:08,"-Excuse me.
-Yes?"
1,10,302,00:21:55:10,00:21:56:19,Goodbye.
1,10,303,00:22:01:20,00:22:03:21,"It is her, right?"
1,10,304,00:22:03:23,00:22:05:06,It is her.
1,10,305,00:22:06:22,00:22:08:02,Hey.
1,10,306,00:22:08:05,00:22:10:13,"-You took my purse, right?
-Give me back my ring."
1,10,307,00:22:15:08,00:22:16:21,"-Goodness!
-Where is she?"
1,10,308,00:22:16:24,00:22:19:10,"-Hey! Stop right there!
-Hey!"
1,10,309,00:22:19:12,00:22:20:16,Stop right there!
1,10,310,00:22:20:18,00:22:23:01,"-You!
-Stop that swindler!"
1,10,311,00:22:23:03,00:22:25:12,"-Thief!
-Hey, come back here!"
1,10,312,00:22:25:14,00:22:29:01,"-Goodness!
-Just wait until I get my hands on you!"
1,10,313,00:22:29:11,00:22:31:12,"-Hey! Stop!
-Wait for me!"
1,10,314,00:22:31:15,00:22:33:17,"-Darn it.
-Hey!"
1,10,315,00:22:33:19,00:22:35:10,"-Hurry up!
-What are you doing?"
1,10,316,00:22:35:13,00:22:36:16,You little…
1,10,317,00:22:36:18,00:22:38:08,Catch that swindler!
1,10,318,00:22:38:11,00:22:40:14,"-She got away.
-Hey."
1,10,319,00:22:40:16,00:22:42:16,"-That is her, right?
-Yes."
1,10,320,00:22:49:20,00:22:51:08,That is Mu-deok.
1,10,321,00:22:51:10,00:22:52:10,Mu-deok!
1,10,322,00:22:57:18,00:22:59:08,"There you are, you…"
1,10,323,00:22:59:10,00:23:01:02,"-You.
-Catch that thief!"
1,10,324,00:23:01:04,00:23:04:05,"Come here.
Wait until I get my hands on you."
1,10,325,00:23:04:07,00:23:05:13,Hey!
1,10,326,00:23:05:15,00:23:06:23,You little…
1,10,327,00:23:19:01,00:23:20:19,It was definitely her.
1,10,328,00:23:22:10,00:23:24:09,But how can she see now?
1,10,329,00:23:38:01,00:23:40:09,She had always covered her eyes with this.
1,10,330,00:23:42:08,00:23:44:02,Was it not her?
1,10,331,00:24:03:19,00:24:05:16,"We finally meet again,"
1,10,332,00:24:06:09,00:24:07:16,So-i.
1,10,333,00:24:08:01,00:24:11:01,"I went all the way to Sari Village
because I heard you were there."
1,10,334,00:24:11:03,00:24:12:23,But you were long gone.
1,10,335,00:24:13:10,00:24:15:19,"Did you think hiding
in the capital would work?"
1,10,336,00:24:17:10,00:24:18:12,What is this?
1,10,337,00:24:19:17,00:24:23:11,Were you pretending to be blind?
1,10,338,00:24:25:14,00:24:28:00,"But then again,
you did put up a nice, pitiful front."
1,10,339,00:24:28:02,00:24:31:16,"Then you would betray others
behind their backs."
1,10,340,00:24:33:24,00:24:35:08,How dare you steal
1,10,341,00:24:36:16,00:24:38:14,my money?
1,10,342,00:24:40:13,00:24:42:09,I do not know what you are--
1,10,343,00:24:43:24,00:24:46:01,Jeez…
1,10,344,00:24:46:17,00:24:50:04,Look at you trying to deceive me again.
1,10,345,00:24:50:16,00:24:51:16,Take her.
1,10,346,00:24:56:01,00:24:57:07,Help me!
1,10,347,00:24:57:09,00:24:59:04,"Somebody, please help me!"
1,10,348,00:25:01:09,00:25:03:15,I am blind!
1,10,349,00:25:03:17,00:25:06:02,"I do not know them,"
1,10,350,00:25:06:04,00:25:08:17,yet they are trying to kidnap me!
1,10,351,00:25:09:06,00:25:12:22,"Someone, please help me!"
1,10,352,00:25:12:24,00:25:15:17,Look at you trying real hard.
1,10,353,00:25:18:11,00:25:19:10,Please help me!
1,10,354,00:25:19:12,00:25:20:19,What are you all looking at?
1,10,355,00:25:20:21,00:25:23:10,"-Come here.
-Let me go!"
1,10,356,00:25:33:23,00:25:36:16,You cannot drag her against her will.
1,10,357,00:25:37:15,00:25:40:07,"I have a good reason for doing this,"
1,10,358,00:25:40:09,00:25:41:24,so just go on your way.
1,10,359,00:25:42:13,00:25:44:09,"I cannot see,"
1,10,360,00:25:44:11,00:25:46:14,"-and I do not know who they are.
-You little--"
1,10,361,00:25:49:01,00:25:50:11,Get him!
1,10,362,00:26:02:08,00:26:04:02,He is a mage.
1,10,363,00:26:04:04,00:26:05:11,Let us go!
1,10,364,00:26:13:15,00:26:15:03,Can you stand?
1,10,365,00:26:20:06,00:26:21:19,Thank you.
1,10,366,00:26:21:21,00:26:23:15,They look like dangerous men.
1,10,367,00:26:23:17,00:26:26:01,You should ask the authorities for help.
1,10,368,00:26:26:16,00:26:27:17,I will take you there.
1,10,369,00:26:27:19,00:26:30:18,"That is all right.
I do not need their help."
1,10,370,00:26:32:07,00:26:33:22,Your cane is broken.
1,10,371,00:26:40:09,00:26:41:12,This is an umbrella.
1,10,372,00:26:42:09,00:26:43:21,You can use this as a cane.
1,10,373,00:27:00:15,00:27:03:05,"Master, it is best to just let her be."
1,10,374,00:27:03:07,00:27:05:20,"She refused to be taken
to the authorities."
1,10,375,00:27:05:22,00:27:08:05,"I do not know what kind of past she has,"
1,10,376,00:27:08:07,00:27:10:05,but those were thugs.
1,10,377,00:27:10:17,00:27:15:00,"Nothing good will come out
of involving yourself in their affairs."
1,10,378,00:27:24:11,00:27:25:19,I will take you there.
1,10,379,00:27:26:12,00:27:29:02,You should ask the authorities for help.
1,10,380,00:27:33:04,00:27:35:05,Maybe I should have said yes.
1,10,381,00:27:56:03,00:27:58:21,Number 125.
1,10,382,00:28:00:05,00:28:02:18,"Did these many people
already sign up for it?"
1,10,383,00:28:02:20,00:28:04:07,ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-FIVE
1,10,384,00:28:05:05,00:28:07:05,They are only picking five people.
1,10,385,00:28:08:06,00:28:10:12,Do I have hope?
1,10,386,00:28:10:23,00:28:12:05,"Hey, Mu-deok."
1,10,387,00:28:13:17,00:28:14:22,Were you here all along?
1,10,388,00:28:14:24,00:28:16:11,The young master was looking for you.
1,10,389,00:28:16:13,00:28:18:24,Did Young Master Seo come by again?
1,10,390,00:28:19:01,00:28:21:07,Not him. Young Master Jang.
1,10,391,00:28:21:22,00:28:24:24,"Young Master Jang snuck out
and has come home."
1,10,392,00:28:34:02,00:28:37:19,"I need to go back before sundown.
Where in the world is she?"
1,10,393,00:29:20:07,00:29:21:10,Where is Young Master Jang?
1,10,394,00:29:21:12,00:29:23:20,"He just left,
but I did not see him either."
1,10,395,00:29:26:05,00:29:28:10,"He said he would be obedient,
so why did he escape?"
1,10,396,00:29:30:03,00:29:32:02,I hope he does not get caught.
1,10,397,00:29:34:23,00:29:36:12,He just left.
1,10,398,00:29:36:23,00:29:38:02,Just now.
1,10,399,00:29:39:21,00:29:41:20,What is with her?
1,10,400,00:30:06:03,00:30:07:11,Jang Uk.
1,10,401,00:30:07:22,00:30:08:24,Young Master!
1,10,402,00:30:13:14,00:30:16:11,"Where have you been?
I thought I would not get to see you."
1,10,403,00:30:45:09,00:30:47:22,I finally got to see you. I am glad.
1,10,404,00:30:50:08,00:30:52:24,"I need to go.
They cannot know that I am gone."
1,10,405,00:30:53:18,00:30:56:12,Wait there. I will go to you soon.
1,10,406,00:30:58:00,00:31:02:05,"I found a way,
so do what you need to do in there."
1,10,407,00:31:02:07,00:31:04:04,I will do what I can out here.
1,10,408,00:31:05:11,00:31:08:05,All right. But what way is that?
1,10,409,00:31:09:11,00:31:11:13,Songrim is hiring.
1,10,410,00:31:32:01,00:31:33:10,Do not get caught and get back safely.
1,10,411,00:31:59:07,00:32:02:12,"Your Royal Highness,
instead of going to Sejukwon yourself,"
1,10,412,00:32:02:14,00:32:04:18,"you should summon
Master Heo to your palace."
1,10,413,00:32:06:02,00:32:09:09,"That is all right.
It gives me a reason to come out."
1,10,414,00:32:09:11,00:32:11:03,I like taking strolls.
1,10,415,00:32:16:24,00:32:18:05,Is that not Jang Uk?
1,10,416,00:32:28:05,00:32:29:21,Why are you out here?
1,10,417,00:32:29:23,00:32:32:00,"I heard you could not leave
the Training Center"
1,10,418,00:32:32:02,00:32:33:20,until you could read Words of the Heart.
1,10,419,00:32:33:22,00:32:36:08,"Not only did you follow me
to where I was drinking,"
1,10,420,00:32:36:10,00:32:38:05,but you are also keeping tabs on me.
1,10,421,00:32:38:19,00:32:41:23,"Why are you so interested in me?
It is making me uncomfortable."
1,10,422,00:32:42:01,00:32:44:05,Master Heo from Sejukwon told me.
1,10,423,00:32:45:00,00:32:48:15,"Right. I heard you fell ill
after drinking the liquor I had given you."
1,10,424,00:32:48:17,00:32:51:03,Then why did you come to Sejukwon?
1,10,425,00:32:51:17,00:32:56:05,Does it still hurt where I hit you?
1,10,426,00:32:56:07,00:32:57:09,"Oh, dear."
1,10,427,00:32:57:11,00:33:00:14,Not at all. I am all better now.
1,10,428,00:33:00:16,00:33:03:06,I only go there to get some supplements.
1,10,429,00:33:03:22,00:33:07:12,"I hope you take many good supplements.
You must live a long, healthy life."
1,10,430,00:33:09:10,00:33:12:06,What were you hiding just a while ago?
1,10,431,00:33:13:04,00:33:14:08,Let me see it.
1,10,432,00:33:31:21,00:33:33:01,It is a honey biscuit.
1,10,433,00:33:33:11,00:33:36:07,"I wanted to eat it for myself.
How did you know?"
1,10,434,00:33:36:18,00:33:38:00,You can have it.
1,10,435,00:33:44:04,00:33:47:10,"Songrim does not have
these kinds of snacks."
1,10,436,00:33:48:18,00:33:50:00,Did you go home?
1,10,437,00:33:56:19,00:34:00:01,"You will be in trouble
if they find out you have sneaked out."
1,10,438,00:34:00:13,00:34:03:19,"You even gave me a congratulatory drink
and complimented me."
1,10,439,00:34:03:21,00:34:06:24,"Will you seriously tattle on me
for this little misdeed?"
1,10,440,00:34:10:11,00:34:13:00,"After all, I even gave you
that honey biscuit."
1,10,441,00:34:18:05,00:34:22:18,"Stay away from that big pine tree.
I saw a group of mages there."
1,10,442,00:34:25:14,00:34:27:21,"Thank you, Your Royal Highness. Goodbye."
1,10,443,00:34:31:24,00:34:34:05,"I do not understand
why I am being nice to him."
1,10,444,00:34:38:14,00:34:40:06,This is tasty.
1,10,445,00:34:40:22,00:34:42:05,Is it?
1,10,446,00:34:46:02,00:34:48:00,"-Is it tasty, Your Royal Highness?
-Yes."
1,10,447,00:34:48:11,00:34:50:14,I thought the Crown Prince
1,10,448,00:34:51:07,00:34:54:04,"would be hostile
toward Songrim after the match."
1,10,449,00:34:55:04,00:34:57:06,"Rather, he has sheathed his sword"
1,10,450,00:34:57:19,00:35:00:02,and become closer to them.
1,10,451,00:35:00:13,00:35:03:20,"He must have decided to befriend them
so that they could be of use"
1,10,452,00:35:03:22,00:35:05:16,when he becomes the next king.
1,10,453,00:35:07:05,00:35:10:15,"Are you sure we do not need
to do anything about it?"
1,10,454,00:35:10:17,00:35:11:23,Do not worry.
1,10,455,00:35:12:00,00:35:14:03,We can easily change his mind.
1,10,456,00:35:14:15,00:35:17:02,We have Jang Uk's constellation plate.
1,10,457,00:35:18:18,00:35:22:08,"The Crown Prince will have no choice
but to kill him eventually."
1,10,458,00:35:33:04,00:35:37:19,"Is that what we will use
to subdue Jin Ho-gyeong?"
1,10,459,00:35:37:21,00:35:41:08,Jinyowon will be ours soon.
1,10,460,00:36:01:20,00:36:04:13,"It has been four hours
since Young Lady Heo went inside."
1,10,461,00:36:07:03,00:36:08:09,Do not bother them.
1,10,462,00:36:08:11,00:36:09:23,They must have a lot to talk about.
1,10,463,00:36:13:12,00:36:16:11,Hey! Wait!
1,10,464,00:36:17:07,00:36:19:13,You should not bother them.
1,10,465,00:36:19:15,00:36:20:20,Something is not right.
1,10,466,00:36:20:22,00:36:23:02,"I must check whether or not
Jang Uk is in there."
1,10,467,00:36:23:04,00:36:25:13,Are you doubting my lady?
1,10,468,00:36:27:06,00:36:28:11,Gosh.
1,10,469,00:36:30:24,00:36:33:04,Why is he not here yet?
1,10,470,00:36:34:18,00:36:38:07,"It will be awkward
if they find out he is not here."
1,10,471,00:36:48:07,00:36:50:08,Why are you here? What are you doing?
1,10,472,00:36:51:03,00:36:55:11,"I told them we were in here together
so they would not catch you leaving."
1,10,473,00:36:56:08,00:36:58:09,I have been waiting for your return.
1,10,474,00:37:04:19,00:37:07:23,See? They are together.
1,10,475,00:37:09:20,00:37:11:07,I will go now.
1,10,476,00:37:11:16,00:37:14:21,I had a great chat with you today.
1,10,477,00:37:16:02,00:37:17:11,Likewise.
1,10,478,00:37:17:22,00:37:19:08,Goodbye.
1,10,479,00:37:29:17,00:37:32:02,"What were you doing here
for the past four hours?"
1,10,480,00:37:33:09,00:37:34:18,Beats me.
1,10,481,00:37:35:09,00:37:38:23,What were we doing here for that long?
1,10,482,00:38:01:06,00:38:02:22,She must have been bored.
1,10,483,00:38:07:03,00:38:09:19,You want to become a servant of Songrim?
1,10,484,00:38:10:05,00:38:12:06,"Yes, ma'am. Look what happened today."
1,10,485,00:38:12:08,00:38:16:19,"Young Master Jang needs me
by his side at all times."
1,10,486,00:38:17:11,00:38:18:14,I agree.
1,10,487,00:38:19:04,00:38:22:23,"He must have been so uncomfortable
that he came here to bathe and eat snacks."
1,10,488,00:38:23:15,00:38:26:23,"Our young master is very sensitive
and has been doted on growing up."
1,10,489,00:38:27:00,00:38:29:09,"Living with others in Songrim
does not suit him."
1,10,490,00:38:29:20,00:38:31:01,ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-FIVE
1,10,491,00:38:31:03,00:38:32:12,I already signed up.
1,10,492,00:38:33:06,00:38:34:13,I will get in at all costs.
1,10,493,00:38:35:09,00:38:37:11,"Hey, you do not need that."
1,10,494,00:38:37:24,00:38:39:12,This is the Jang family.
1,10,495,00:38:39:14,00:38:41:04,We can easily put you in there.
1,10,496,00:38:41:16,00:38:42:14,Is that true?
1,10,497,00:38:42:16,00:38:45:16,"Does that mean
I do not need to take the test?"
1,10,498,00:38:45:18,00:38:48:10,Of course not. Just trust me.
1,10,499,00:38:51:12,00:38:53:02,That is not possible.
1,10,500,00:38:53:15,00:38:57:11,"Songrim's servants are only chosen
through open recruitments."
1,10,501,00:38:57:13,00:38:58:19,There is no exception.
1,10,502,00:38:58:21,00:39:01:01,"I am not asking you
to give her a free position."
1,10,503,00:39:01:03,00:39:03:22,"She just needs the entrance plaque.
Just register her name"
1,10,504,00:39:03:24,00:39:05:13,so she can get one.
1,10,505,00:39:05:15,00:39:07:13,We will pay you monthly.
1,10,506,00:39:10:23,00:39:12:08,Also…
1,10,507,00:39:12:21,00:39:14:01,Here.
1,10,508,00:39:15:08,00:39:18:17,"I thought it would suit you,
so I got you one, Maidservant Park."
1,10,509,00:39:23:10,00:39:24:19,Here.
1,10,510,00:39:49:14,00:39:53:11,Word has it that you bribed
1,10,511,00:39:53:13,00:39:57:14,Maidservant Park of Songrim with this.
1,10,512,00:39:58:01,00:40:01:07,"-It was purely a gift…
-I heard you asked her"
1,10,513,00:40:02:01,00:40:04:10,to give Mu-deok a spot there.
1,10,514,00:40:04:12,00:40:07:13,"Since our young master is so sensitive,"
1,10,515,00:40:07:15,00:40:09:14,I thought having Mu-deok by his side
1,10,516,00:40:09:16,00:40:13:19,"would help him with his training,
so I asked for a favor."
1,10,517,00:40:15:04,00:40:16:13,So this truly was a bribe!
1,10,518,00:40:17:18,00:40:21:01,I apologize. It was thoughtless of me.
1,10,519,00:40:21:03,00:40:23:04,"When Maidservant Park brought this to me,"
1,10,520,00:40:23:06,00:40:26:06,"I vehemently told her
that you were not one to do such a thing."
1,10,521,00:40:26:22,00:40:28:00,I defended you.
1,10,522,00:40:28:02,00:40:32:02,How will I dare face her ever again?
1,10,523,00:40:32:04,00:40:33:14,I…
1,10,524,00:40:37:18,00:40:40:08,I will apologize to her.
1,10,525,00:40:40:20,00:40:42:04,What will everyone think?
1,10,526,00:40:42:21,00:40:46:07,"They will think you abused
your relationship with me"
1,10,527,00:40:46:10,00:40:48:06,to bribe someone.
1,10,528,00:40:48:09,00:40:51:20,"I did give her that scarf,
but I never mentioned you to her."
1,10,529,00:40:51:22,00:40:53:01,"Even so,"
1,10,530,00:40:53:03,00:40:55:19,"everyone in Songrim knows
that you and I are close."
1,10,531,00:40:55:21,00:40:59:17,"If you do this, I can no longer…"
1,10,532,00:41:02:22,00:41:07:02,have a close relationship with you.
1,10,533,00:41:08:19,00:41:12:16,"In that case, I will stop coming here."
1,10,534,00:41:13:16,00:41:14:22,And what did you say?
1,10,535,00:41:14:24,00:41:18:18,Was our relationship ever that deep?
1,10,536,00:41:19:05,00:41:21:00,"If we were truly close,"
1,10,537,00:41:21:02,00:41:24:03,"you would not have mentioned
cutting ties with me so easily."
1,10,538,00:41:24:05,00:41:25:18,Fine.
1,10,539,00:41:26:06,00:41:29:15,"-Maidservant Kim, I…
-I will tell Maidservant Park"
1,10,540,00:41:29:17,00:41:32:02,"that I, who bribes people,"
1,10,541,00:41:32:04,00:41:33:15,am not close
1,10,542,00:41:33:17,00:41:36:20,with the leader of Songrim even one bit.
1,10,543,00:41:36:22,00:41:38:08,"-Look--

1,10,554,00:42:29:22,00:42:31:17,Maidservant Kim!
1,10,555,00:42:36:22,00:42:38:06,This is difficult.
1,10,556,00:42:55:24,00:42:57:16,You cannot do it yet.
1,10,557,00:43:00:06,00:43:01:13,Master Lee.
1,10,558,00:43:02:00,00:43:05:02,"You cannot read that book

1,10,560,00:43:08:21,00:43:11:22,"How long will it take
if I start training now?"
1,10,561,00:43:11:24,00:43:14:13,The earliest would be in a year.
1,10,562,00:43:15:10,00:43:18:15,"I cannot do that. I refuse
to be stuck in here for that long."
1,10,563,00:43:18:18,00:43:22:00,"I think that is exactly the reason
why Park Jin gave you that book."
1,10,564,00:43:26:09,00:43:28:00,You could shorten that time
1,10,565,00:43:28:15,00:43:32:08,"if you become my pupil
and receive my teachings."
1,10,566,00:43:32:11,00:43:33:19,Do you mean
1,10,567,00:43:34:24,00:43:36:21,by drinking that chaste herb tea?
1,10,568,00:43:39:23,00:43:42:11,Please give me some time to think.

1,10,571,00:43:50:15,00:43:51:19,Poem?

1,10,573,00:43:54:22,00:43:57:11,"Once you read the first word,"
1,10,574,00:43:57:13,00:43:59:16,the rest will come easily to you.

1,10,576,00:44:04:17,00:44:07:18,"Are you having fun teasing me?
It is not like you will tell me."
1,10,577,00:44:07:20,00:44:09:06,It is quite entertaining to watch.
1,10,578,00:44:11:02,00:44:13:18,Shall I help you again this time?
1,10,579,00:44:15:12,00:44:16:11,"Yes, please."
1,10,580,00:44:17:05,00:44:20:19,"Let me tell you one secret
about this book that no one knows of."
1,10,581,00:44:21:22,00:44:25:16,This poem is actually a love letter.
1,10,582,00:44:27:02,00:44:28:11,A love letter?
1,10,583,00:44:28:13,00:44:29:14,That is right.
1,10,584,00:44:29:16,00:44:33:18,"Countless mages have read this,
but no one knows that fact."
1,10,585,00:44:37:12,00:44:41:13,"Master Seo Gyeong wrote this
for a lady who could not see"
1,10,586,00:44:41:15,00:44:44:15,so that she could read it with her heart.
1,10,587,00:44:49:02,00:44:52:07,"You can read it by training
your concentration skills."
1,10,588,00:44:52:09,00:44:56:13,"But try to think of another way
since I told you it was a love letter."
1,10,589,00:44:57:24,00:45:01:21,How does a love letter begin?
1,10,590,00:45:08:23,00:45:10:06,What is this?
1,10,591,00:45:13:03,00:45:14:09,Was he a pervert?
1,10,592,00:45:14:11,00:45:18:05,"Why would he make others
read his love letter?"
1,10,593,00:45:18:13,00:45:21:10,"Why must I read this?
It is invisible to me."
1,10,594,00:45:22:02,00:45:23:19,Was he really a pervert?
1,10,595,00:45:26:14,00:45:31:00,"Master Lee, it is getting colder now.
Instead of returning to Danhyanggok,"
1,10,596,00:45:31:02,00:45:34:09,"how about you stay here?
I will treat you well."
1,10,597,00:45:34:24,00:45:36:00,Yeom.
1,10,598,00:45:36:02,00:45:40:20,"I cannot train by wearing warm clothes
and feeling comfortable."

from the Jang family."
1,10,602,00:46:12:18,00:46:15:22,"Seeing how she looks unhappy,
she must have fought with Jin again."
1,10,603,00:46:17:05,00:46:19:06,Goodness. Hello.

1,10,606,00:46:28:06,00:46:29:23,I did not have the chance to thank you.
1,10,607,00:46:30:00,00:46:33:10,Have you two met before?
1,10,608,00:46:33:21,00:46:36:18,We met at the party in Chwiseonru.
1,10,609,00:46:37:16,00:46:39:04,How are your clothes?
1,10,610,00:46:39:06,00:46:41:15,I made your seam run.
1,10,611,00:46:42:18,00:46:44:03,I am fine.

1,10,613,00:46:45:20,00:46:47:06,I see.
1,10,614,00:46:47:16,00:46:48:20,It is very cold.
1,10,615,00:46:48:22,00:46:50:23,Do you not feel cold in those clothes?
1,10,616,00:46:52:06,00:46:54:01,Wear this.
1,10,617,00:46:54:03,00:46:56:16,I wanted to get you a thank-you gift.
1,10,618,00:46:59:15,00:47:02:21,"This is a gift, not a bribe."

1,10,726,00:55:23:09,00:55:26:11,"Park Jun-hwa, you have passed."
1,10,727,00:55:27:00,00:55:29:08,"Lee Yeong-ok, failed."
1,10,728,00:55:29:10,00:55:32:16,"Hwang Yeon-ji, failed."
1,10,729,00:55:33:08,00:55:35:13,"Oh Jae-ho, you have passed."
1,10,730,00:55:37:21,00:55:39:13,Number 125.
1,10,731,00:55:39:15,00:55:41:02,Mu-deok.
1,10,732,00:55:50:23,00:55:52:12,Your Royal Highness!
1,10,733,00:55:54:17,00:55:56:03,She got in!
1,10,734,00:55:56:05,00:55:57:23,Yes!
1,10,735,00:56:02:00,00:56:03:10,Good work.
1,10,736,00:56:04:01,00:56:08:04,Forty of you have passed the first test.
1,10,737,00:56:08:07,00:56:11:24,Now comes the practical test.
1,10,738,00:56:14:08,00:56:18:21,"The practical test
will evaluate them on their duties."
1,10,739,00:56:19:14,00:56:20:22,"They will prepare ingredients,"
1,10,740,00:56:21:00,00:56:23:20,"clean, and wash clothes."
1,10,741,00:56:23:23,00:56:26:13,"Lastly, there will be a fitness test."
1,10,742,00:56:55:17,00:56:58:08,"Number 125, Mu-deok."
1,10,743,00:56:58:10,00:56:59:24,You have passed.
1,10,744,00:57:28:21,00:57:30:23,"Number 125, Mu-deok."
1,10,745,00:57:31:00,00:57:32:02,You have passed!
1,10,746,00:57:34:24,00:57:36:07,ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-FIVE
1,10,747,00:57:46:22,00:57:48:24,"Number 125, Mu-deok."
1,10,748,00:57:49:08,00:57:50:20,You have passed!
1,10,749,00:57:53:24,00:57:56:12,"Gosh, Mu-deok is impressive."
1,10,750,00:57:56:14,00:57:58:09,"Now, it is the fitness test."
1,10,751,00:57:58:11,00:58:00:13,We should go and cheer for her.
1,10,752,00:58:01:03,00:58:04:01,I saw many fit individuals back there.
1,10,753,00:58:04:03,00:58:06:09,"I highly doubt she will be
one of the last five."
1,10,754,00:58:06:12,00:58:08:22,"Your Royal Highness,
thank you for helping us."
1,10,755,00:58:09:07,00:58:10:10,Goodbye.
1,10,756,00:58:12:14,00:58:14:21,"-Let us go.
-All right."
1,10,757,00:58:17:06,00:58:21:04,"That was his way of telling me
not to come, right?"
1,10,758,00:58:21:06,00:58:23:16,"Goodness, why did they have to be so mean?"
1,10,759,00:58:23:18,00:58:26:00,Unbelievable.
1,10,760,00:58:26:19,00:58:28:13,Forget it. Let us go.
1,10,761,00:58:29:04,00:58:30:15,"Your Royal Highness, it is this way."
1,10,762,00:58:33:11,00:58:35:15,"-I know.
-Of course, Your Royal Highness."
1,10,763,00:58:36:11,00:58:40:22,"You will travel five ri
and bring back some water."
1,10,764,00:58:40:24,00:58:42:14,Those who are the first five
1,10,765,00:58:43:02,00:58:46:13,to arrive will be the final winners.
1,10,766,00:58:47:16,00:58:49:01,This is the last hurdle.
1,10,767,00:58:50:02,00:58:52:06,I must be in the first five.
1,10,768,00:59:04:07,00:59:05:06,Go!
1,10,769,00:59:13:17,00:59:16:24,"He has been looking
at Words of the Heart for days on end."
1,10,770,00:59:18:14,00:59:19:21,Is that so?
1,10,771,00:59:27:24,00:59:29:24,It will not happen that soon.
1,10,772,00:59:30:01,00:59:31:16,Have patience.
1,10,773,00:59:33:18,00:59:35:04,"Yes, my lord."
1,10,774,00:59:35:18,00:59:39:04,Maidservant Kim is worried sick about you.
1,10,775,00:59:39:22,00:59:41:17,Let me know if you need anything.
1,10,776,00:59:41:19,00:59:46:02,"I will prepare your bed, food,
and clothes to your liking."
1,10,777,00:59:47:19,00:59:49:09,I am fine.
1,10,778,00:59:58:09,01:00:00:18,The wind is getting chillier now.
1,10,779,01:00:00:20,01:00:03:09,Keep the windows closed.
1,10,780,01:00:04:19,01:00:08:23,"Master Seo Gyeong wrote this
for a lady who could not see"
1,10,781,01:00:09:00,01:00:12:03,so that she could read it with her heart.
1,10,782,01:00:13:15,01:00:15:09,I have one question.
1,10,783,01:00:16:08,01:00:20:08,"Did Master Seo Gyeong know
of a woman who could not see?"
1,10,784,01:00:24:01,01:00:26:15,"During the Great Chaos
that occurred 200 years ago,"
1,10,785,01:00:27:03,01:00:29:09,the first leader of Jinyowon
1,10,786,01:00:29:11,01:00:31:20,"was the one who helped
Master Seo Gyeong by his side."
1,10,787,01:00:31:22,01:00:35:00,And she could not see.
1,10,788,01:00:36:02,01:00:39:24,"He had written this love letter
for the leader of Jinyowon."
1,10,789,01:00:41:18,01:00:45:24,"By the way, are you sure
you can let others read this?"
1,10,790,01:00:46:11,01:00:48:15,What if these are his private thoughts
1,10,791,01:00:48:17,01:00:50:22,that you are making everyone read?
1,10,792,01:00:54:20,01:00:57:24,"You must be trying to use me
to read what is written in there."
1,10,793,01:00:58:12,01:01:00:07,I will tell you this.
1,10,794,01:01:00:09,01:01:05:13,"Those words have nothing to do
with his private thoughts."
1,10,795,01:01:07:16,01:01:12:09,"Countless mages have read this,
but no one knows that fact."
1,10,796,01:01:12:19,01:01:15:15,"Right. No one knows
that it is a love letter."
1,10,797,01:01:15:17,01:01:17:16,"Instead of coming up with tricks,"
1,10,798,01:01:17:18,01:01:20:09,"you should focus more
on training yourself."
1,10,799,01:01:21:00,01:01:24:09,"How could no one know
that this is a love letter?"
1,10,800,01:01:29:03,01:01:32:11,"You can read it by training
your concentration skills."
1,10,801,01:01:32:14,01:01:37:07,"But try to think of another way
since I told you it was a love letter."
1,10,802,01:01:37:24,01:01:41:20,"There must be a different way
to read this love letter."
1,10,803,01:01:42:17,01:01:44:21,"Those who read this
through training do not know."
1,10,804,01:01:44:23,01:01:47:15,"Only those who are aware
that it is a love letter can read it."
1,10,805,01:01:48:00,01:01:49:10,But how?
1,10,806,01:01:49:12,01:01:52:20,How does a love letter begin?
1,10,807,01:02:03:18,01:02:05:07,I have one last question.
1,10,808,01:02:06:02,01:02:07:23,What was the name
1,10,809,01:02:08:19,01:02:10:11,of the first leader of Jinyowon?
1,10,810,01:02:22:15,01:02:24:17,All love letters begin
1,10,811,01:02:25:24,01:02:28:00,with the recipient's name.
1,10,812,01:02:28:19,01:02:30:01,Her surname
1,10,813,01:02:30:12,01:02:33:20,"was Jin, and her first name was Seol-ran."
1,10,814,01:02:34:16,01:02:37:00,The recipient's name was Seol-ran.
1,10,815,01:02:37:02,01:02:38:21,"""An orchid that blooms"
1,10,816,01:02:39:22,01:02:41:08,"in the white snow."""
1,10,817,01:02:42:18,01:02:44:03,Her name
1,10,818,01:02:45:04,01:02:47:05,will open this letter.
1,10,819,01:03:14:15,01:03:19:24,"YOU CANNOT GRASP WATER
BUT IT IS INSIDE THE SOIL"
1,10,820,01:03:25:13,01:03:26:22,I can read it.
1,10,821,01:03:34:23,01:03:37:02,"Hey, there she is."
1,10,822,01:03:38:23,01:03:40:18,There is Mu-deok.
1,10,823,01:03:55:03,01:03:56:20,"""You cannot grasp water,"
1,10,824,01:03:58:04,01:03:59:21,"but it is inside the soil."""
1,10,825,01:04:01:12,01:04:03:13,"""You cannot touch fire,"
1,10,826,01:04:03:15,01:04:05:05,"but it is inside the tree."""

1,10,828,01:04:10:22,01:04:12:12,"but it is resting on the rock."""

1,10,833,01:04:29:15,01:04:31:24,"turned into snow and tears."""

1,10,835,01:04:37:08,01:04:40:05,"""Despite knowing that
they will fill up once again,"
1,10,836,01:04:40:19,01:04:45:07,"I am a fool

1,10,837,01:04:50:10,01:04:52:05,Those two are already back.
1,10,838,01:04:54:17,01:04:56:01,I do not see Mu-deok.
1,10,839,01:05:04:12,01:05:06:14,There are six people in front of Mu-deok.
1,10,840,01:05:06:16,01:05:09:00,"She needs to beat
at least two of them to win."
1,10,841,01:05:19:08,01:05:22:14,"I AM A FOOL
WHO DARES NOT SHED A SINGLE TEAR"
1,10,842,01:05:29:17,01:05:32:02,"YOU CANNOT GRASP WATER

1,10,843,01:05:38:13,01:05:39:19,Where are you going?
1,10,844,01:05:40:17,01:05:41:24,Right.
1,10,845,01:05:44:07,01:05:45:13,I read it.
1,10,846,01:06:07:20,01:06:08:20,"Number 29,"
1,10,847,01:06:08:23,01:06:10:23,Jang Jeong-do. You have passed.
1,10,848,01:06:11:20,01:06:14:04,Only one more remains.
1,10,849,01:06:47:00,01:06:49:06,"I do not need a pupil
who does not improve."
1,10,850,01:06:49:14,01:06:51:20,"Just die if you are
not going to do anything."
1,10,851,01:06:52:17,01:06:54:17,Hey! That is dangerous!
1,10,852,01:06:54:20,01:06:56:16,You are no longer Naksu.
1,10,853,01:07:03:04,01:07:05:07,"No matter how pathetic you feel,"
1,10,854,01:07:06:05,01:07:08:11,you must do what you can at the moment.
1,10,855,01:07:10:19,01:07:12:19,"If I am not willing to do anything,"
1,10,856,01:07:14:05,01:07:15:21,I might as well just die.
1,10,857,01:07:35:04,01:07:37:04,"Number 125, Mu-deok."
1,10,858,01:07:39:11,01:07:40:24,You have passed!
1,10,859,01:07:48:08,01:07:49:23,"YOU CANNOT GRASP WATER
BUT IT IS INSIDE THE SOIL"
1,10,860,01:07:50:00,01:07:52:24,"It is exactly identical
to Words of the Heart."
1,10,861,01:07:53:13,01:07:55:15,Jang Uk accomplished the task.
1,10,862,01:07:57:21,01:07:59:11,He accomplished the task?
1,10,863,01:08:04:04,01:08:07:08,"-Where is he right now?
-He is at Sejukwon."
1,10,864,01:08:07:10,01:08:10:17,"The maid who was always with him
collapsed while taking the test,"
1,10,865,01:08:10:19,01:08:12:03,so he took her there.
1,10,866,01:08:13:04,01:08:14:12,His maid?
1,10,867,01:08:15:00,01:08:16:24,"-Do you mean Mu-deok?
-Yes, my lord."
1,10,868,01:08:17:01,01:08:19:04,She passed the test today.
1,10,869,01:08:19:18,01:08:21:23,"She did pass out at the finish line,"
1,10,870,01:08:22:00,01:08:24:05,but she did indeed make it.
1,10,871,01:08:24:19,01:08:26:04,Is that so?
1,10,872,01:08:30:07,01:08:33:20,"My maid only risked her life
by doing what she was told to do."
1,10,873,01:08:34:08,01:08:35:22,It was all my doing.
1,10,874,01:08:48:18,01:08:50:05,"Now that I think of it,"
1,10,875,01:08:51:20,01:08:54:03,she was always beside Uk.
1,10,876,01:08:56:01,01:08:57:21,"His maid, Mu-deok…"
1,10,877,01:09:03:13,01:09:07:12,"The book that I read was actually
Master Seo Gyeong's love letter."
1,10,878,01:09:10:03,01:09:11:11,Really?
1,10,879,01:09:12:03,01:09:14:09,Then why did he make it invisible?
1,10,880,01:09:14:24,01:09:18:18,"The woman could not see.
He wanted her to read with her heart."
1,10,881,01:09:19:23,01:09:21:14,How wistful.
1,10,882,01:09:21:24,01:09:23:06,I do not think
1,10,883,01:09:23:23,01:09:25:21,the letter was sent.
1,10,884,01:09:26:11,01:09:28:17,"If it was, it would have been in Jinyowon,"
1,10,885,01:09:29:07,01:09:31:00,not Songrim.
1,10,886,01:09:31:11,01:09:34:19,"An invisible love letter
that was never sent?"
1,10,887,01:09:36:18,01:09:37:24,What a coward.
1,10,888,01:09:39:20,01:09:42:07,"He wrote down his feelings
without her knowing."
1,10,889,01:09:43:15,01:09:45:04,What a foolish
1,10,890,01:09:46:08,01:09:48:01,and pitiful love letter.
1,10,891,01:09:53:13,01:09:55:14,You are right. He should have…
1,10,892,01:09:58:13,01:10:00:12,delivered the letter like you did.
1,10,893,01:10:01:20,01:10:04:15,RECRUITING SERVANTS FOR SONGRIM
1,10,894,01:10:05:20,01:10:07:07,That is not a letter.
1,10,895,01:10:07:09,01:10:08:18,What is there to a letter?
1,10,896,01:10:08:20,01:10:11:17,As long as it delivers your feelings.
1,10,897,01:10:13:02,01:10:15:14,Wait there. I will go to you soon.
1,10,898,01:10:15:16,01:10:17:14,Do not get caught and get back safely.
1,10,899,01:10:26:20,01:10:31:03,"You must have pitied me
for trying to get in here as a servant."
1,10,900,01:10:31:24,01:10:34:19,"You used to be
an incredibly experienced master."
1,10,901,01:10:35:02,01:10:37:01,I did feel bad for you.
1,10,902,01:10:37:21,01:10:40:08,"I guess I helped you learn
about loyalty and duties."
1,10,903,01:10:40:11,01:10:42:12,"Seeing how far you would go as my master,"
1,10,904,01:10:42:14,01:10:46:02,I did think that I should do my best.
1,10,905,01:10:48:06,01:10:50:02,You must have felt pressured.
1,10,906,01:10:50:18,01:10:53:17,Not really. But I was in a dilemma.
1,10,907,01:10:54:08,01:10:59:06,"I did not know if I should reply
as your young master or pupil."
1,10,908,01:10:59:16,01:11:02:14,Or just reply based on what I read.
1,10,909,01:11:08:06,01:11:09:24,What did you read?
1,10,910,01:11:10:18,01:11:14:14,"Then should I also reply
based on what I read?"
1,10,911,01:11:16:01,01:11:17:19,Also? What do you mean?
1,10,912,01:11:18:03,01:11:22:10,"It is written here.
""I will go this far just to see you."""
1,10,913,01:11:22:24,01:11:26:10,"""I can do anything
if it means being able to see you."""
1,10,914,01:11:26:22,01:11:28:10,And this is my reply.
1,10,915,01:11:33:10,01:11:38:00,"I should have braced myself
before letting him get this close to me."
1,10,916,01:11:42:00,01:11:43:16,I also missed you.
1,10,917,01:11:47:10,01:11:48:22,That is my reply.
1,10,918,01:11:57:23,01:11:59:22,What I gave him
1,10,919,01:12:01:06,01:12:05:10,"should not have been read
or delivered in the first place."
1,10,920,01:12:07:03,01:12:08:23,It was my foolish and pathetic
1,10,921,01:12:10:14,01:12:12:07,love letter.
