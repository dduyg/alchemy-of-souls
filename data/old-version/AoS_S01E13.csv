1,13,1,00:00:51:00,00:00:52:15,Is it possible to treat soul shifters
1,13,2,00:00:52:20,00:00:55:21,"and turn them back into humans
even after they have run wild?"
1,13,3,00:00:57:01,00:01:00:09,"We are not treating him
to turn him back into a human being."
1,13,4,00:01:00:21,00:01:04:18,"We are merely trying to keep him
conscious enough for him to speak."
1,13,5,00:01:08:03,00:01:10:12,"So you are not looking for a way
to bring them back."
1,13,6,00:01:10:20,00:01:14:00,"Once a soul shifter runs wild,
they are no longer human."
1,13,7,00:01:14:23,00:01:16:05,They are monsters.
1,13,8,00:01:18:02,00:01:21:00,"They either feed off
the energy of human beings,"
1,13,9,00:01:21:03,00:01:23:14,"or they get petrified.
It is one or the other."
1,13,10,00:01:30:13,00:01:32:07,We cannot stop them from running wild.
1,13,11,00:01:36:21,00:01:38:00,The ice stone.
1,13,12,00:01:39:21,00:01:42:06,"I heard the ice stone
carries the power of Hwansu."
1,13,13,00:01:42:08,00:01:44:13,"Maybe that could stop them
from running wild."
1,13,14,00:01:45:24,00:01:48:12,"Yes, maybe. However,"
1,13,15,00:01:49:04,00:01:53:03,"that kind of power
should be forbidden to mankind."
1,13,16,00:02:06:14,00:02:08:12,It looks like it is going to rain.
1,13,17,00:02:10:12,00:02:13:07,"I did not even get to use
the energy of the Soul Ejector."
1,13,18,00:02:13:09,00:02:16:08,"It looks like it will
get washed away by the rain."
1,13,19,00:02:16:10,00:02:19:09,"Can the energy of the Soul Ejector
disappear due to the rain?"
1,13,20,00:02:19:11,00:02:21:21,"The power of the ice stone
came from the skies."
1,13,21,00:02:21:24,00:02:24:17,"Thus, its power can
also be taken away by the skies."
1,13,22,00:02:45:22,00:02:48:15,"I wonder if that girl tried to summon
the power of the skies"
1,13,23,00:02:48:17,00:02:51:07,to make the ice stone disappear.
1,13,24,00:02:55:23,00:02:57:14,Jin Bu-yeon.
1,13,25,00:02:58:20,00:03:02:02,"If she were alive,
she would have become a great priestess"
1,13,26,00:03:02:12,00:03:05:08,"who could even control
the energy of the skies."
1,13,27,00:03:29:09,00:03:30:24,You are fine.
1,13,28,00:03:31:11,00:03:34:12,"Look. I am all right too.
You did not run wild."
1,13,29,00:03:52:22,00:03:55:03,"The ceiling above the constellation basin
has opened."
1,13,30,00:03:55:14,00:03:58:00,"- Was it not always open?
- No."
1,13,31,00:03:58:13,00:04:00:03,"It may seem like it,"
1,13,32,00:04:00:24,00:04:02:19,but I was told that it was not.
1,13,33,00:04:02:21,00:04:05:06,Who told you that? Your father?
1,13,34,00:04:06:15,00:04:09:15,"He said the only way to open
the ceiling above the constellation basin"
1,13,35,00:04:09:18,00:04:12:13,"is by the energy
of a constellation recorder mage."
1,13,36,00:04:12:20,00:04:14:13,How did this open?
1,13,37,00:04:14:18,00:04:18:00,"In any case, it seems like
we did something we should not have."
1,13,38,00:04:18:07,00:04:19:13,I wonder what happened.
1,13,39,00:04:21:13,00:04:22:18,It was me.
1,13,40,00:04:24:14,00:04:26:02,I opened it.
1,13,41,00:04:26:22,00:04:28:20,My energy seeped inside the water.
1,13,42,00:04:29:17,00:04:31:14,Just like at Lake Gyeongcheondaeho
1,13,43,00:04:32:06,00:04:34:00,and inside the Mirror of Longing.
1,13,44,00:04:35:24,00:04:38:09,"This water enabled me
to get my energy back."
1,13,45,00:04:57:01,00:04:58:11,What do you mean lightning struck?
1,13,46,00:04:58:13,00:05:01:07,"There was a loud noise coming from
the Constellation Recording room."
1,13,47,00:05:01:09,00:05:04:14,"That is where Eunuch Kim
and Jang Uk are right now."
1,13,48,00:05:12:11,00:05:14:12,It is the energy of the Soul Ejector.
1,13,49,00:05:15:00,00:05:18:01,"I felt the same dark energy
when Gil-ju attempted to shift souls."
1,13,50,00:05:20:12,00:05:21:18,What is the matter?
1,13,51,00:05:22:00,00:05:24:22,"I cannot see just like how I could not
when I came out of the mirror."
1,13,52,00:05:25:18,00:05:27:08,I feel dizzy and nauseous.
1,13,53,00:05:27:11,00:05:29:22,Jin Mu will be back soon. We must leave.
1,13,54,00:05:41:24,00:05:43:11,"Oh, right. The door."
1,13,55,00:05:45:14,00:05:48:11,"The door is locked with his energy,
the constellation basin is damaged,"
1,13,56,00:05:48:13,00:05:50:01,and the soul shifter is dead.
1,13,57,00:05:51:09,00:05:52:12,This is bad.
1,13,58,00:05:53:04,00:05:56:01,"There is an exit for servants
next to the constellation basin."
1,13,59,00:05:56:17,00:05:59:08,"My father used to take me out
through that exit."
1,13,60,00:05:59:11,00:06:01:23,But we will still be inside Cheonbugwan.
1,13,61,00:06:05:18,00:06:08:18,"You cannot see,
and I do not know my way around here."
1,13,62,00:06:09:24,00:06:13:09,"If we get lost,
the mages here will catch us."
1,13,63,00:06:13:11,00:06:15:17,"If we stay here,
Jin Mu will come and kill us."
1,13,64,00:06:15:19,00:06:17:16,I am not strong enough to defeat him.
1,13,65,00:06:21:05,00:06:24:02,I am going to call my savior for help.
1,13,66,00:06:25:06,00:06:27:05,"- Your savior?
- It is someone I know."
1,13,67,00:06:29:01,00:06:32:19,"A person who will come running over
with a fluttering heart."
1,13,68,00:06:33:12,00:06:35:02,My savior.
1,13,69,00:06:58:21,00:07:01:08,"Uk, you must be mad."
1,13,70,00:07:06:21,00:07:08:13,You heard a loud noise inside?
1,13,71,00:07:08:15,00:07:11:17,"Yes, but you told us not to go inside,
so we did not."
1,13,72,00:07:11:19,00:07:14:15,"Yeom-su, follow me.
The rest can stay and guard the door."
1,13,73,00:07:30:04,00:07:32:09,Jang Uk broke the barrier and escaped.
1,13,74,00:07:32:13,00:07:33:16,Assistant Gwanju.
1,13,75,00:07:34:01,00:07:35:12,The constellation basin…
1,13,76,00:07:36:13,00:07:38:13,What happened to the constellation basin?
1,13,77,00:07:39:11,00:07:41:00,I must find him.
1,13,78,00:07:41:02,00:07:43:02,I cannot let Uk leave this place alive.
1,13,79,00:07:43:14,00:07:45:08,Move this body to the Secret Room.
1,13,80,00:07:45:10,00:07:48:04,"- Do not let anybody see you.
- Yes, sir."
1,13,81,00:07:54:16,00:07:56:20,Seal all the exits of Cheonbugwan.
1,13,82,00:07:56:22,00:07:58:20,Then find Jang Uk and his maid.
1,13,83,00:07:59:07,00:08:01:19,"If they try to fight, you may kill them."
1,13,84,00:08:01:21,00:08:02:24,"- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir."
1,13,85,00:08:17:12,00:08:21:07,"Uk will never manage to find his way
out of this maze-like place."
1,13,86,00:08:22:11,00:08:24:02,He will get lost and get caught.
1,13,87,00:08:26:07,00:08:27:10,"But then again,"
1,13,88,00:08:28:06,00:08:32:07,"maybe he knew he would get lost
and just decided to hide instead."
1,13,89,00:08:35:12,00:08:37:09,You almost fooled me.
1,13,90,00:08:38:11,00:08:39:22,Are you here?
1,13,91,00:08:40:21,00:08:43:13,"I noticed you broke
the water barrier I had made."
1,13,92,00:08:43:15,00:08:45:19,How about I make one with fire this time?
1,13,93,00:08:47:11,00:08:50:01,"If I surround this place with fire,"
1,13,94,00:08:50:03,00:08:53:01,maybe it will get hot enough
1,13,95,00:08:53:15,00:08:55:07,for you to finally show yourself.
1,13,96,00:08:55:09,00:08:59:13,"Try to convince me like you did earlier
instead of trying to blackmail me."
1,13,97,00:09:01:14,00:09:03:18,Why should I when I have nothing to lose?
1,13,98,00:09:04:05,00:09:07:24,"You are a trespasser who came unannounced
and broke the constellation basin."
1,13,99,00:09:08:01,00:09:10:02,"And as the Assistant Gwanju
of Cheonbugwan,"
1,13,100,00:09:10:04,00:09:12:06,it is my duty to get rid of trespassers.
1,13,101,00:09:15:11,00:09:18:06,"You are being too harsh
to a guest who came bearing gifts."
1,13,102,00:09:18:08,00:09:21:20,"Are you angry that we turned
your friend here into stone?"
1,13,103,00:09:21:22,00:09:23:02,What friend?
1,13,104,00:09:23:19,00:09:28:07,"I do not recall seeing anyone else here
other than you, your maid, and myself."
1,13,105,00:09:28:21,00:09:31:04,I see you plan to hide that mass of rock.
1,13,106,00:09:32:01,00:09:33:12,But here is some bad news.
1,13,107,00:09:34:17,00:09:37:12,"- You will get caught.
- That will not happen."
1,13,108,00:09:37:21,00:09:40:21,Because you and your maid will soon die.
1,13,109,00:09:41:19,00:09:43:01,Now show yourself.
1,13,110,00:09:43:12,00:09:44:18,Come on out!
1,13,111,00:10:12:00,00:10:13:18,Did you see it?
1,13,112,00:10:13:20,00:10:16:02,"A bolt of lightning struck
near Cheonbugwan."
1,13,113,00:10:16:04,00:10:18:19,Cheonbugwan is right next to the palace.
1,13,114,00:10:18:21,00:10:21:13,"I must go and see
if everyone is all right."
1,13,115,00:10:21:15,00:10:23:11,That bolt of lightning was enormous.
1,13,116,00:10:23:13,00:10:26:02,I do hope Jin Mu got hit by it.
1,13,117,00:10:41:07,00:10:42:15,It is a pity.
1,13,118,00:10:43:11,00:10:46:02,"I bet you came here elated,"
1,13,119,00:10:46:04,00:10:48:09,hoping to become the Gwanju one day.
1,13,120,00:10:48:12,00:10:50:01,"But instead, your death awaits."
1,13,121,00:10:50:03,00:10:52:00,You are one unlucky man.
1,13,122,00:10:53:12,00:10:54:24,That is too bad.
1,13,123,00:10:55:03,00:10:56:07,"If I were to die,"
1,13,124,00:10:56:09,00:10:58:15,you would have easily become the Gwanju.
1,13,125,00:10:58:17,00:11:00:07,"However, that will not happen."
1,13,126,00:11:00:09,00:11:01:12,What?
1,13,127,00:11:03:23,00:11:05:18,Have you heard of the yin-and-yang jade?
1,13,128,00:11:07:03,00:11:09:15,"It consists of
a pair of red and blue jade."
1,13,129,00:11:09:17,00:11:12:07,"If you fill one with energy,
the other reacts to it."
1,13,130,00:11:12:09,00:11:13:20,"If they are close by,"
1,13,131,00:11:14:12,00:11:16:16,"the two will find each other
no matter what."
1,13,132,00:11:17:20,00:11:18:21,What about that?
1,13,133,00:11:18:24,00:11:20:14,"Of the two,"
1,13,134,00:11:21:04,00:11:23:06,"the blue jade is
in the Crown Prince's possession."
1,13,135,00:11:25:05,00:11:26:08,That is a nice jade.
1,13,136,00:11:26:10,00:11:28:24,I got it in exchange for ten gold toads.
1,13,137,00:11:29:01,00:11:30:08,Is it something valuable?
1,13,138,00:11:32:05,00:11:34:00,So what if he has that?
1,13,139,00:11:34:02,00:11:36:08,I had the other red jade.
1,13,140,00:11:36:10,00:11:39:02,"I filled it with energy,
which means the Crown Prince"
1,13,141,00:11:39:20,00:11:41:13,is on his way here to find it.
1,13,142,00:11:51:08,00:11:53:04,Are you going to kill me and take it?
1,13,143,00:11:54:11,00:11:57:07,"I figured you would do that,
so I hid it somewhere else."
1,13,144,00:11:59:16,00:12:02:03,"I filled the red jade
with energy and hid it"
1,13,145,00:12:02:05,00:12:04:07,"inside the robe
of the eunuch that ran wild."
1,13,146,00:12:13:22,00:12:17:19,"The Crown Prince is
probably on his way to that mass of rock."
1,13,147,00:12:20:24,00:12:23:11,"Imagine how he would react
when he sees that body."
1,13,148,00:12:24:05,00:12:26:23,"Gosh, he will get quite the shock."
1,13,149,00:12:39:07,00:12:40:10,Cheonbugwan.
1,13,150,00:12:42:21,00:12:45:00,Jang Uk is somewhere inside Cheonbugwan.
1,13,151,00:12:52:09,00:12:54:03,"Rather than killing me,"
1,13,152,00:12:54:21,00:12:57:00,you should go stop the Crown Prince.
1,13,153,00:13:01:14,00:13:03:06,I will be back.
1,13,154,00:13:04:05,00:13:06:20,"You will never be able
to leave this place anyway."
1,13,155,00:13:18:11,00:13:20:16,"- Where did you put Eunuch Kim?
- In the Secret Room."
1,13,156,00:13:20:18,00:13:23:05,"If you give me your order,
I will take his body outside."
1,13,157,00:13:32:21,00:13:34:04,Where…
1,13,158,00:13:37:02,00:13:40:18,"It is not here.
That little punk fooled me again."
1,13,159,00:13:43:14,00:13:45:00,"Assistant Gwanju, sir."
1,13,160,00:13:45:02,00:13:48:00,"I know you ordered not to let anyone in,
but we had no choice."
1,13,161,00:13:48:12,00:13:51:04,What? Is the Crown Prince here?
1,13,162,00:13:51:06,00:13:52:09,Yes.
1,13,163,00:13:54:08,00:13:56:15,"So he was not lying about
the yin-and-yang jade."
1,13,164,00:14:13:04,00:14:14:05,Assistant Gwanju.
1,13,165,00:14:14:07,00:14:17:13,"Did a eunuch serving the royal family
really turn out to be a soul shifter?"
1,13,166,00:14:20:14,00:14:23:04,"And I heard you tried to kill Uk
to keep that a secret."
1,13,167,00:14:23:06,00:14:25:11,"That is a big misunderstanding,
Your Royal Highness."
1,13,168,00:15:02:07,00:15:03:13,You even tried
1,13,169,00:15:03:15,00:15:06:05,"to use my maid
as prey for that soul shifter."
1,13,170,00:15:06:08,00:15:10:09,"You better have a good excuse
for this to be a misunderstanding."
1,13,171,00:15:22:12,00:15:25:12,"Are you asking about Cho Chung,
the man who used to work"
1,13,172,00:15:25:14,00:15:27:23,as a constellation mage at Cheonbugwan?
1,13,173,00:15:28:07,00:15:32:01,"I heard Jang Gang
and Cho Chung were very close."
1,13,174,00:15:32:03,00:15:33:07,"Yes, they were."
1,13,175,00:15:33:23,00:15:35:18,They were very good friends.
1,13,176,00:15:36:06,00:15:38:01,He visited our home often.
1,13,177,00:15:38:13,00:15:42:04,"He made funny jokes,
and he was a warm-hearted man."
1,13,178,00:15:43:04,00:15:44:21,"Cho Chung got involved with sorcery,"
1,13,179,00:15:44:23,00:15:47:14,"and that eventually wiped out
his entire family."
1,13,180,00:15:47:16,00:15:49:09,He was such a good man.
1,13,181,00:15:49:23,00:15:53:13,"It is still hard to believe
that such a thing happened to him."
1,13,182,00:15:54:20,00:15:58:19,"Cho Chung had a daughter.
Did you also know her?"
1,13,183,00:15:59:13,00:16:01:03,"Yes, I remember her."
1,13,184,00:16:01:12,00:16:05:06,"She was always right beside her father
and was very close with him too."
1,13,185,00:16:05:08,00:16:07:12,"I heard she also disappeared
amid the chaos."
1,13,186,00:16:08:06,00:16:09:09,I am guessing
1,13,187,00:16:10:02,00:16:11:15,that she is dead.
1,13,188,00:16:12:11,00:16:14:19,Why do you think so?
1,13,189,00:16:14:21,00:16:18:22,"Master Jang Gang tried to find that girl
for a very long time."
1,13,190,00:16:19:19,00:16:22:24,"If she was still alive,
he would have found her already,"
1,13,191,00:16:23:01,00:16:25:03,unless someone was purposely hiding her.
1,13,192,00:16:26:06,00:16:27:20,Madam Do-hwa had passed away.
1,13,193,00:16:28:15,00:16:30:17,"His best friend had
ended up in such a state."
1,13,194,00:16:30:19,00:16:34:02,"Master Jang was not
in his right mind back then."
1,13,195,00:16:34:13,00:16:38:00,He blamed himself for both their deaths
1,13,196,00:16:38:14,00:16:40:07,and was in great agony.
1,13,197,00:16:41:09,00:16:43:20,"He left home
to find his friend's daughter,"
1,13,198,00:16:43:22,00:16:46:06,"and I thought
he would come back once he did."
1,13,199,00:16:46:16,00:16:47:19,But…
1,13,200,00:16:48:10,00:16:52:09,"It is odd that he would leave home
for 20 years just to find a little girl."
1,13,201,00:16:53:01,00:16:55:18,"I am starting to worry that maybe
he has not returned"
1,13,202,00:16:55:20,00:16:57:09,because of another reason.
1,13,203,00:16:57:19,00:17:01:15,"If he had found the girl 20 years ago,"
1,13,204,00:17:02:06,00:17:04:22,her life would not have been so hard.
1,13,205,00:17:04:24,00:17:08:23,"And Jang Gang would not have had
to feel so guilty."
1,13,206,00:17:09:00,00:17:10:14,"""Guilty""?"
1,13,207,00:17:10:16,00:17:14:18,"Are you implying that what Master Jang did
to his friend was wrong?"
1,13,208,00:17:15:06,00:17:17:08,He punished someone who practiced sorcery.
1,13,209,00:17:17:10,00:17:19:09,That was the right thing to do as a mage.
1,13,210,00:17:19:11,00:17:23:13,"No matter how close they may have been,
it was not wrong of him to punish him."
1,13,211,00:17:23:15,00:17:28:00,"You cannot judge what is right or wrong
merely based on the things you see."
1,13,212,00:17:28:11,00:17:30:24,There are stories to everything.
1,13,213,00:17:31:01,00:17:34:05,"And fate is made up of
many stories and relationships."
1,13,214,00:17:34:07,00:17:36:05,"Are you implying that
the ill-fated relationship"
1,13,215,00:17:36:07,00:17:41:08,"between the Cho family and the Jang family
has not yet ended?"
1,13,216,00:17:42:22,00:17:44:00,"By any chance,"
1,13,217,00:17:44:23,00:17:49:00,"are you saying that a member
of the Cho family is in this household?"
1,13,218,00:17:49:22,00:17:52:08,Did Songrim find the girl?
1,13,219,00:17:54:18,00:17:56:05,That girl…
1,13,220,00:17:58:09,00:17:59:16,Is dead.
1,13,221,00:18:05:00,00:18:06:05,I see.
1,13,222,00:18:06:22,00:18:08:05,Poor thing.
1,13,223,00:18:09:07,00:18:11:09,I should hold a memorial service for her.
1,13,224,00:18:14:14,00:18:15:22,Maidservant Kim.
1,13,225,00:18:16:22,00:18:18:10,You are very warm-hearted.
1,13,226,00:18:18:12,00:18:20:11,It is not a gesture of kindness.
1,13,227,00:18:20:13,00:18:23:21,"I just do not wish her spirit
to remain in this world"
1,13,228,00:18:24:06,00:18:25:21,and harass Young Master Jang.
1,13,229,00:18:26:07,00:18:30:15,"What if her spirit
is indeed lingering by Uk?"
1,13,230,00:18:30:17,00:18:33:16,"I should get rid of it.
She would have become an evil spirit."
1,13,231,00:18:33:18,00:18:35:17,I cannot let such a thing linger by him.
1,13,232,00:18:37:04,00:18:39:01,An evil spirit?
1,13,233,00:18:42:24,00:18:44:13,Where is Mu-deok?
1,13,234,00:18:44:15,00:18:45:23,Mu-deok?
1,13,235,00:18:46:10,00:18:49:15,"I sent her to Cheonbugwan
to run an errand."
1,13,236,00:18:56:15,00:18:58:04,Are you all right? Can you see?
1,13,237,00:18:58:20,00:19:00:19,"Yes, I can see now."
1,13,238,00:19:01:05,00:19:02:07,"And you, Young Master?"
1,13,239,00:19:02:09,00:19:04:16,Did you get hurt anywhere?
1,13,240,00:19:04:18,00:19:05:21,I am all right.
1,13,241,00:19:05:23,00:19:08:07,"What does it mean when two people
share something that should be a pair?"
1,13,242,00:19:08:09,00:19:10:18,It means they are married or a couple.
1,13,243,00:19:14:00,00:19:17:09,"Songrim's leader has come to Cheonbugwan
as you have ordered, Your Royal Highness."
1,13,244,00:19:37:21,00:19:39:15,You came to Cheonbugwan
1,13,245,00:19:40:06,00:19:42:23,"to give honey biscuits
to the Assistant Gwanju?"
1,13,246,00:19:43:00,00:19:46:24,"Yes, I heard you two had an argument
over honey biscuits."
1,13,247,00:19:47:12,00:19:49:19,"Maidservant Kim did not want him
to stay upset,"
1,13,248,00:19:49:21,00:19:51:21,so I brought what she had sent him.
1,13,249,00:19:51:23,00:19:53:12,What a feeble excuse.
1,13,250,00:19:54:10,00:19:55:14,The leader of Songrim
1,13,251,00:19:55:16,00:19:58:19,"and Assistant Gwanju of Cheonbugwan
fighting over honey biscuits?"
1,13,252,00:20:00:02,00:20:02:19,"Even if that were true,
you could have left right away."
1,13,253,00:20:02:21,00:20:04:24,"Why were you in the main room
with the constellation basin?"
1,13,254,00:20:05:01,00:20:07:08,I wanted to see the constellation basin.
1,13,255,00:20:07:12,00:20:10:17,"However, I ended up seeing something
that I should not have."
1,13,256,00:20:11:14,00:20:15:03,Are you sure you saw a soul shifter?
1,13,257,00:20:15:05,00:20:18:16,"Yes, he locked me inside a barrier
to hide that fact"
1,13,258,00:20:18:18,00:20:21:07,"and threw Mu-deok to
the soul shifter so he could feed on her."
1,13,259,00:20:21:09,00:20:22:24,He is lying.
1,13,260,00:20:24:11,00:20:27:12,"Jang Uk entered the main room
of Cheonbugwan without permission"
1,13,261,00:20:27:15,00:20:29:12,and damaged the constellation basin.
1,13,262,00:20:29:15,00:20:31:23,"Now that he finds himself in trouble,"
1,13,263,00:20:32:00,00:20:35:01,"he is making up an absurd lie
about a soul shifter."
1,13,264,00:20:36:20,00:20:38:13,I am sure it was a soul shifter.
1,13,265,00:20:38:15,00:20:40:14,He ran wild and got petrified.
1,13,266,00:20:40:16,00:20:42:13,My maid and I both saw it.
1,13,267,00:20:42:15,00:20:44:23,"When I arrived,
I did not see the body of a soul shifter."
1,13,268,00:20:45:00,00:20:46:15,He probably hid it somewhere.
1,13,269,00:20:46:17,00:20:48:11,You need to block all the exits
1,13,270,00:20:48:13,00:20:51:12,"and find the body of the soul shifter
before he takes it out."
1,13,271,00:20:54:09,00:20:58:17,"I guess the truth will be revealed
once we find the soul shifter's body."
1,13,272,00:21:01:12,00:21:04:10,"I shall summon the mages of Songrim
and investigate Cheonbugwan."
1,13,273,00:21:04:12,00:21:07:23,"No. I cannot let him
search through Cheongbugwan"
1,13,274,00:21:08:00,00:21:10:11,based on a ridiculous lie.
1,13,275,00:21:15:24,00:21:17:11,Jang Uk.
1,13,276,00:21:18:12,00:21:20:13,"Did you say the soul shifter
was a royal eunuch?"
1,13,277,00:21:20:15,00:21:21:12,"Yes, Your Royal Highness."
1,13,278,00:21:21:14,00:21:25:05,"I saw him beside the Queen
the day you came to Songrim for a duel."
1,13,279,00:21:25:07,00:21:27:20,"Eunuch Oh,
which eunuch was there that day?"
1,13,280,00:21:27:22,00:21:30:15,"Eunuch Kim, Your Royal Highness.
He serves the Queen."
1,13,281,00:21:31:19,00:21:34:24,"Then we just need to check
whether or not he is in the palace."
1,13,282,00:21:35:10,00:21:37:01,Go and check if he is there.
1,13,283,00:21:37:03,00:21:39:07,That will be unnecessary.
1,13,284,00:22:02:09,00:22:03:15,The Queen is here!
1,13,285,00:22:03:17,00:22:05:10,Bow before her!
1,13,286,00:22:12:22,00:22:14:03,Mother.
1,13,287,00:22:15:08,00:22:17:15,"The Assistant Gwanju
told me what happened."
1,13,288,00:22:17:17,00:22:19:18,"I was shocked, so I came here myself."
1,13,289,00:22:23:06,00:22:26:08,"Is it true that a soul shifter
was found here?"
1,13,290,00:22:26:22,00:22:29:06,"The eunuch who served you
was a soul shifter."
1,13,291,00:22:29:08,00:22:32:01,"He ran wild and got petrified
here at Cheonbugwan."
1,13,292,00:22:33:18,00:22:36:03,"- Is that so?
- That is not true."
1,13,293,00:22:36:15,00:22:38:24,No soul shifter ran wild here.
1,13,294,00:22:39:01,00:22:40:10,It is simply a lie
1,13,295,00:22:41:14,00:22:43:05,that Jang Uk is making up.
1,13,296,00:22:43:08,00:22:48:01,"Let us see if it is a lie or not
after we search for the eunuch's body."
1,13,297,00:22:50:19,00:22:54:18,"Who is this soul shifter eunuch
that he claims to have seen?"
1,13,298,00:22:55:17,00:22:57:03,Eunuch Kim.
1,13,299,00:23:04:14,00:23:08:02,Eunuch Kim came here with me.
1,13,300,00:23:18:18,00:23:20:16,"Eunuch Kim, come inside."
1,13,301,00:23:51:17,00:23:53:08,Is he the eunuch
1,13,302,00:23:54:07,00:23:56:08,that you claim to have seen
1,13,303,00:23:56:20,00:23:58:15,run wild?
1,13,304,00:24:00:05,00:24:01:06,Yes.
1,13,305,00:24:01:08,00:24:03:24,You said he got petrified.
1,13,306,00:24:04:01,00:24:06:13,But he is well and alive.
1,13,307,00:24:07:20,00:24:09:04,You are right.
1,13,308,00:24:13:01,00:24:14:18,He is completely fine.
1,13,309,00:24:23:07,00:24:25:14,The only way to get out of this situation…
1,13,310,00:24:28:11,00:24:31:03,Is to bring this thing back to life.
1,13,311,00:24:47:03,00:24:48:22,He is fine even after he ran wild.
1,13,312,00:24:49:22,00:24:51:23,"If that is the power of the ice stone,"
1,13,313,00:24:52:00,00:24:54:15,"it means I can save Mu-deok
even if she ever runs wild."
1,13,314,00:24:55:10,00:24:56:13,Mu-deok.
1,13,315,00:24:57:17,00:24:59:17,We must have been mistaken.
1,13,316,00:25:01:10,00:25:02:22,"I guess so, Young Master."
1,13,317,00:25:05:01,00:25:07:15,You were not mistaken. You blatantly lied.
1,13,318,00:25:07:17,00:25:09:23,"He is standing there completely fine,"
1,13,319,00:25:10:16,00:25:12:24,so I guess that means I was lying.
1,13,320,00:25:17:07,00:25:19:06,He tried to lie his way out
1,13,321,00:25:19:08,00:25:22:14,"because he got scared that
he broke the constellation basin."
1,13,322,00:25:22:16,00:25:23:24,Uk.
1,13,323,00:25:25:05,00:25:27:02,Is that true?
1,13,324,00:25:28:15,00:25:32:09,"Yes, it is true.
Everything I said was a lie."
1,13,325,00:25:35:01,00:25:38:07,"You entered Cheonbugwan without permission
and broke a valuable possession."
1,13,326,00:25:38:09,00:25:42:05,"Then you made up a lie
to get yourself out of the situation?"
1,13,327,00:25:42:07,00:25:45:03,I apologize. I am sorry.
1,13,328,00:25:47:17,00:25:49:11,"This was done by a mage of Songrim,"
1,13,329,00:25:49:13,00:25:52:12,so allow me to apologize on his behalf.
1,13,330,00:25:54:02,00:25:57:03,"I would also like to apologize
to Assistant Gwanju Jin Mu."
1,13,331,00:26:01:04,00:26:05:23,"Songrim will fix
the broken constellation basin."
1,13,332,00:26:08:04,00:26:09:10,That is unnecessary.
1,13,333,00:26:09:12,00:26:10:17,Do not refuse.
1,13,334,00:26:10:19,00:26:13:09,"It is only right that
we take full responsibility."
1,13,335,00:26:14:23,00:26:16:13,"- No.
- Your Highness."
1,13,336,00:26:16:24,00:26:19:19,"Please give Songrim a chance
to make up for our mistake."
1,13,337,00:26:21:23,00:26:23:15,"You should let them do that, Mother."
1,13,338,00:26:25:13,00:26:27:13,You may do as you wish.
1,13,339,00:26:28:13,00:26:30:18,I shall head back now.
1,13,340,00:26:53:11,00:26:56:10,"I will send our people to Cheonbugwan
starting from tomorrow"
1,13,341,00:26:56:12,00:26:58:12,and have them fix what has been damaged.
1,13,342,00:26:59:02,00:27:02:10,"As for now,
I should head back to punish our mage"
1,13,343,00:27:02:12,00:27:05:20,"for having deceived the royal family
and the people of Cheonbugwan."
1,13,344,00:27:06:18,00:27:08:08,"- Let us go.
- Nonsense."
1,13,345,00:27:08:22,00:27:12:08,Jang Uk will stay and get punished here.
1,13,346,00:27:17:11,00:27:19:09,I also think that is…
1,13,347,00:27:20:06,00:27:22:05,"My goodness, Your Royal Highness."
1,13,348,00:27:22:22,00:27:24:18,Please help my young master.
1,13,349,00:27:25:05,00:27:27:13,Do not let him get taken to Songrim.
1,13,350,00:27:30:01,00:27:33:23,"If he gets taken there,
he might get flogged to death."
1,13,351,00:27:36:04,00:27:37:17,"Last time,"
1,13,352,00:27:37:19,00:27:40:00,he got flogged 100 times in Songrim.
1,13,353,00:27:40:15,00:27:42:17,"This time, it will only be worse."
1,13,354,00:27:42:19,00:27:45:00,Please do not let that happen.
1,13,355,00:27:46:22,00:27:48:06,"Mu-deok, that is enough."
1,13,356,00:27:50:03,00:27:53:09,"What I did was wrong.
It is only right for me to get punished."
1,13,357,00:27:56:22,00:27:59:04,"I failed to show courtesy
to His Royal Highness."
1,13,358,00:28:01:15,00:28:03:10,I have no right to ask for mercy.
1,13,359,00:28:03:12,00:28:07:11,"Then are you going to let them
drag you away and kill you?"
1,13,360,00:28:08:01,00:28:10:09,"If that is what the leader wants,
then yes."
1,13,361,00:28:13:03,00:28:14:06,"Oh, goodness."
1,13,362,00:28:19:23,00:28:21:13,You can take me.
1,13,363,00:28:23:20,00:28:25:14,"My goodness, Young Master!"
1,13,364,00:28:25:16,00:28:27:10,But you will die!
1,13,365,00:28:27:22,00:28:32:02,"Goodness, you will die if you go back!"
1,13,366,00:28:34:14,00:28:39:04,I will punish him adequately.
1,13,367,00:28:43:06,00:28:45:01,Hey. You there.
1,13,368,00:28:49:11,00:28:51:13,Uk will be punished severely.
1,13,369,00:28:51:15,00:28:53:09,So just forget about what happened.
1,13,370,00:28:54:06,00:28:55:20,How ridiculous.
1,13,371,00:28:55:22,00:28:57:01,"But then again,"
1,13,372,00:28:57:12,00:29:00:02,"the honey biscuit story
was absurd to begin with."
1,13,373,00:29:00:17,00:29:03:08,"The leader of Songrim
and Assistant Gwanju of Cheonbugwan"
1,13,374,00:29:03:10,00:29:05:03,fighting over honey biscuits?
1,13,375,00:29:05:24,00:29:07:03,Goodness.
1,13,376,00:29:07:18,00:29:09:07,What an outrageous excuse.
1,13,377,00:29:10:24,00:29:12:03,Right.
1,13,378,00:29:14:06,00:29:16:07,But how did the constellation basin break?
1,13,379,00:29:19:03,00:29:21:02,"If it got struck by lightning,"
1,13,380,00:29:21:04,00:29:23:15,"it means the ceiling
above the constellation basin was open."
1,13,381,00:29:23:18,00:29:27:01,"But I thought only those
who have reached Chisu could open it."
1,13,382,00:29:27:23,00:29:29:06,That is correct.
1,13,383,00:29:32:06,00:29:34:20,Jang Uk could not have reached Chisu.
1,13,384,00:29:38:24,00:29:41:03,I wonder how this broke.
1,13,385,00:29:46:24,00:29:51:02,"Was there another mage here
who had reached Chisu?"
1,13,386,00:29:51:17,00:29:53:12,But that would be impossible.
1,13,387,00:30:09:22,00:30:13:03,"We were able to get out of there
thanks to you, Mu-deok."
1,13,388,00:30:13:05,00:30:15:00,"If you try to hold on, people let go."
1,13,389,00:30:15:02,00:30:17:06,"If you let go, people try to hold on."
1,13,390,00:30:17:08,00:30:21:03,"So you caused a fuss on purpose?
That was clever of you."
1,13,391,00:30:21:05,00:30:24:03,"I did not think
they would be convinced by you,"
1,13,392,00:30:24:05,00:30:26:11,so I got involved without any permission.
1,13,393,00:30:26:13,00:30:28:17,I am sorry to have flustered you.
1,13,394,00:30:29:10,00:30:32:15,"I did not expect that,
so it is true that I was flustered."
1,13,395,00:30:34:12,00:30:35:19,But you did well.
1,13,396,00:30:37:08,00:30:38:13,My lord.
1,13,397,00:30:38:15,00:30:40:14,We were not lying.
1,13,398,00:30:40:16,00:30:44:08,"We clearly saw Eunuch Kim run wild
and get petrified."
1,13,399,00:30:44:10,00:30:45:21,I know you were not lying.
1,13,400,00:30:46:08,00:30:48:18,"I may be slow-witted at times,"
1,13,401,00:30:48:20,00:30:50:20,but I can tell lies from the truth.
1,13,402,00:30:51:16,00:30:53:09,"A petrified soul shifter
came back to life."
1,13,403,00:30:53:11,00:30:57:05,Does that mean they have the ice stone?
1,13,404,00:30:57:22,00:30:59:17,Songrim has been
1,13,405,00:31:00:13,00:31:03:10,keeping our eyes on Jin Mu.
1,13,406,00:31:03:23,00:31:05:14,It is just as expected.
1,13,407,00:31:07:18,00:31:09:20,I guess they really do have the ice stone.
1,13,408,00:31:15:17,00:31:19:14,"Did you insert the ice stone
inside my body?"
1,13,409,00:31:19:16,00:31:22:03,Its power is truly astounding.
1,13,410,00:31:23:00,00:31:25:13,It really feels like I am still alive.
1,13,411,00:31:26:18,00:31:30:06,"Was it Jang Uk who caused you
to become petrified?"
1,13,412,00:31:31:01,00:31:34:05,"Just as I was about to suck out
his servant's energy,"
1,13,413,00:31:34:19,00:31:38:20,"my energy suddenly started
to leave my body,"
1,13,414,00:31:39:15,00:31:41:02,and I lost consciousness.
1,13,415,00:31:42:03,00:31:45:19,"Did you also not see Jang Uk open
the ceiling above the constellation basin?"
1,13,416,00:31:46:09,00:31:47:17,"No, I did not."
1,13,417,00:31:48:20,00:31:51:12,"Was there another mage there
other than Jang Uk?"
1,13,418,00:31:52:08,00:31:53:17,"No, there was not."
1,13,419,00:31:54:18,00:31:57:01,What if Jang Uk has reached Chisu already?
1,13,420,00:31:57:16,00:31:59:02,Maybe he is just hiding it.
1,13,421,00:32:00:16,00:32:04:07,"When he tried to attack me,
he did not seem that skilled."
1,13,422,00:32:04:09,00:32:07:15,"He mastered Ryusu
in an extremely short amount of time."
1,13,423,00:32:08:08,00:32:09:20,So it is possible.
1,13,424,00:32:12:15,00:32:14:17,"Now that I have the ice stone,"
1,13,425,00:32:14:19,00:32:18:02,does that mean I am capable of Hwansu?
1,13,426,00:32:21:05,00:32:23:13,You do possess the power of it.
1,13,427,00:32:24:11,00:32:27:07,"However, you do not know
how to practice spells."
1,13,428,00:32:27:10,00:32:30:10,"Therefore, you are unable to use it."
1,13,429,00:32:35:23,00:32:38:19,But this ice stone is mine now.
1,13,430,00:32:38:21,00:32:41:23,"I only brought you back to life
momentarily because it was urgent."
1,13,431,00:33:35:19,00:33:37:19,"So the ice stone
really does have the ability"
1,13,432,00:33:37:21,00:33:40:11,"to stop a soul shifter
from getting petrified."
1,13,433,00:33:41:07,00:33:42:24,We must find it and destroy it.
1,13,434,00:33:43:16,00:33:47:06,"We should be getting rid of soul shifters,
but it brings them back to life."
1,13,435,00:33:47:08,00:33:49:07,Its power is truly evil.
1,13,436,00:33:50:21,00:33:52:00,But that is…
1,13,437,00:33:53:18,00:33:57:06,"Uk, word will get out
about your punishment,"
1,13,438,00:33:57:08,00:33:59:07,so you should not be in Songrim.
1,13,439,00:33:59:21,00:34:01:06,Stay at home for a while.
1,13,440,00:34:01:08,00:34:05:04,"Yes, my lord.
Mu-deok and I will head home."
1,13,441,00:34:05:06,00:34:09:17,Be careful not to cross paths with Jin Mu.
1,13,442,00:34:10:21,00:34:11:24,I will.
1,13,443,00:34:13:22,00:34:15:03,Let us go.
1,13,444,00:34:23:03,00:34:25:09,"He will get rid of the ice stone
as soon as he finds it."
1,13,445,00:34:25:12,00:34:27:09,We need to find it before he does.
1,13,446,00:34:27:12,00:34:29:04,Gil-ju was right.
1,13,447,00:34:29:19,00:34:32:15,The ice stone is inside the palace.
1,13,448,00:34:33:00,00:34:36:08,Then the Danju who possesses the ice stone
1,13,449,00:34:37:03,00:34:38:14,must be that person.
1,13,450,00:34:42:18,00:34:45:03,Take care of everything quietly.
1,13,451,00:34:45:05,00:34:47:19,I will have Court Lady Han take his place.
1,13,452,00:34:47:21,00:34:50:05,You may relay your messages through her.
1,13,453,00:34:50:18,00:34:52:01,"Yes, Your Highness."
1,13,454,00:34:52:15,00:34:56:23,"Because of what happened today,
Songrim will start suspecting me."
1,13,455,00:34:57:09,00:35:02:03,"This all happened
because you underestimated Jang Uk."
1,13,456,00:35:02:15,00:35:05:10,"I had no idea
he would break free so easily."
1,13,457,00:35:05:13,00:35:07:19,"He is a genius
who instantly reached Ryusu."
1,13,458,00:35:07:21,00:35:10:00,"He was born with the energy
of the King's Star."
1,13,459,00:35:10:02,00:35:11:22,"I did not underestimate him
from the start."
1,13,460,00:35:12:17,00:35:14:07,I also figured he might be special
1,13,461,00:35:14:10,00:35:17:04,"because he was born
with the energy of the King's star."
1,13,462,00:35:17:07,00:35:20:13,"However, Jang Uk turned out to be
a complete disappointment."
1,13,463,00:35:20:15,00:35:23:11,"He was just an average boy
with nothing special about him."
1,13,464,00:35:26:10,00:35:30:02,"He was angry at the world,
and he hid his helplessness and indolence"
1,13,465,00:35:30:04,00:35:34:10,"by putting on a cold-hearted mask.
He never did anything with a goal."
1,13,466,00:35:34:22,00:35:37:11,"He was just a young master
who was full of himself,"
1,13,467,00:35:37:23,00:35:40:09,so all one ever had to do was appease him.
1,13,468,00:35:41:05,00:35:43:06,That means he has changed.
1,13,469,00:35:44:05,00:35:45:21,I thought he was weak.
1,13,470,00:35:45:23,00:35:48:18,"But he opened his gate of energy
by consuming poison."
1,13,471,00:35:48:20,00:35:52:06,"I thought he liked to show off,
but he actually beat the Crown Prince."
1,13,472,00:35:53:04,00:35:55:06,"Why do you think
he changed all of a sudden?"
1,13,473,00:35:55:09,00:35:57:08,People change…
1,13,474,00:35:58:17,00:36:00:07,Because of other people.
1,13,475,00:36:01:11,00:36:04:08,"Find out who showed up
just when he began to change."
1,13,476,00:36:07:06,00:36:08:13,That will be your answer.
1,13,477,00:36:12:07,00:36:15:24,"Jang Uk was rejected by 12 masters,
but has finally found his way…"
1,13,478,00:36:19:11,00:36:21:06,Who could have helped him do that?
1,13,479,00:36:24:22,00:36:27:15,"Master, should we go straight
to Danhyanggok?"
1,13,480,00:36:28:20,00:36:31:14,"Thanks to my punishment,
we have some time."
1,13,481,00:36:32:00,00:36:33:19,Let us train at Danhyanggok.
1,13,482,00:36:33:21,00:36:36:19,We can also try climbing up that tree.
1,13,483,00:36:40:19,00:36:42:21,It is freezing right now at Danhyanggok.
1,13,484,00:36:43:16,00:36:46:06,"If we get stuck there due to the snow,"
1,13,485,00:36:47:03,00:36:48:14,we could starve to death.
1,13,486,00:36:48:16,00:36:51:16,"I thought it was warm during the winter
and had a lot to eat."
1,13,487,00:36:51:18,00:36:54:05,I heard you say that to Yul last time.
1,13,488,00:36:58:00,00:37:01:11,I only said that to put him at ease.
1,13,489,00:37:05:21,00:37:09:05,"He was worried that his pet bird
might have suffered during the winter,"
1,13,490,00:37:09:07,00:37:10:21,so I told him that.
1,13,491,00:37:11:14,00:37:16:01,"You mean the bird he always called
using his whistle at Danhyanggok?"
1,13,492,00:37:37:19,00:37:41:02,Uk was almost killed by Jin Mu.
1,13,493,00:37:42:09,00:37:46:09,"I apologized for what Uk did
and got him out of there."
1,13,494,00:37:46:11,00:37:49:08,But Jin Mu might try to harm Uk.
1,13,495,00:37:52:08,00:37:55:15,"Fortunately, I insisted on
fixing the constellation basin,"
1,13,496,00:37:55:17,00:37:57:13,so we have access to Cheonbugwan.
1,13,497,00:37:59:20,00:38:03:03,"I want you to go to Cheonbugwan
along with Songrim's laborers"
1,13,498,00:38:03:18,00:38:05:12,and keep an eye on Jin Mu.
1,13,499,00:38:06:18,00:38:08:05,"- Yes, my lord.
- Yes, my lord."
1,13,500,00:38:17:10,00:38:18:19,Sang-ho.
1,13,501,00:38:19:14,00:38:22:08,"I heard Mu-deok was
also at Cheonbugwan today."
1,13,502,00:38:22:10,00:38:24:02,Is she all right?
1,13,503,00:38:24:04,00:38:25:14,She is fine.
1,13,504,00:38:28:24,00:38:32:16,"By the way, did the soul shifter
who ran wild and got petrified"
1,13,505,00:38:32:18,00:38:34:14,really come back to life?
1,13,506,00:38:34:16,00:38:38:05,"That is why the leader had to leave
without being able to say anything."
1,13,507,00:38:40:15,00:38:42:13,How did Uk react to that?
1,13,508,00:38:42:24,00:38:44:24,He actually did not seem too flustered.
1,13,509,00:38:45:10,00:38:48:04,"He kept asking the leader
if the soul shifter who ran wild"
1,13,510,00:38:48:07,00:38:50:22,"was able to come back to life
thanks to the ice stone."
1,13,511,00:38:50:24,00:38:53:04,"He already seemed to know
about the ice stone."
1,13,512,00:38:55:13,00:38:58:13,"So he saw a soul shifter come back to life
with his own two eyes."
1,13,513,00:38:58:15,00:39:01:05,"The leader told him
that they must be destroyed."
1,13,514,00:39:02:06,00:39:04:06,Both the soul shifters and ice stones.
1,13,515,00:39:04:08,00:39:06:15,"He said we must
get rid of all things that are evil."
1,13,516,00:39:09:10,00:39:11:20,What did Uk say to that?
1,13,517,00:39:11:22,00:39:13:23,"This is just my hunch,"
1,13,518,00:39:14:19,00:39:16:10,but he seemed to disagree.
1,13,519,00:39:17:03,00:39:20:09,Uk is always carefree and easygoing.
1,13,520,00:39:20:12,00:39:24:14,"However, he should not keep that attitude
toward sorcery as well."
1,13,521,00:39:25:13,00:39:27:12,You and Uk are close.
1,13,522,00:39:27:14,00:39:29:17,So you should warn him about it.
1,13,523,00:39:41:18,00:39:44:06,"Not only is Danhyanggok cold,"
1,13,524,00:39:44:08,00:39:46:20,"but it would also mean
we would have to be alone."
1,13,525,00:39:47:13,00:39:50:00,"We should refrain from doing that
from now on."
1,13,526,00:39:50:18,00:39:52:08,Why all of a sudden?
1,13,527,00:39:54:24,00:39:56:06,I am scared that…
1,13,528,00:39:58:19,00:40:00:10,I might devour your energy.
1,13,529,00:40:00:22,00:40:04:03,"You did not run wild.
Nothing happened even after we touched."
1,13,530,00:40:04:05,00:40:06:17,"I clearly absorbed
the energy of that eunuch."
1,13,531,00:40:07:03,00:40:08:14,"I may seem fine now,"
1,13,532,00:40:08:16,00:40:11:06,"but we never know
when that might happen again."
1,13,533,00:40:12:23,00:40:14:13,"Feel free to run away,"
1,13,534,00:40:15:05,00:40:17:02,or kill me if you must.
1,13,535,00:40:19:10,00:40:21:11,But if I devour your energy until you die…
1,13,536,00:40:23:13,00:40:25:04,That will be unbearable.
1,13,537,00:40:34:02,00:40:35:10,Why are you laughing?
1,13,538,00:40:35:24,00:40:37:15,Is this funny to you?
1,13,539,00:40:38:06,00:40:39:18,"No, it is not that."
1,13,540,00:40:42:14,00:40:43:21,You made my heart race.
1,13,541,00:40:46:09,00:40:48:00,What you just said…
1,13,542,00:40:49:04,00:40:51:17,"Holds a deeper meaning
than saying, ""I missed you."""
1,13,543,00:40:54:15,00:40:57:03,The cruel assassin has finally replied
1,13,544,00:40:58:08,00:41:01:02,to my naive and sincere love confession.
1,13,545,00:41:10:04,00:41:12:04,I will find the ice stone
1,13,546,00:41:12:19,00:41:16:03,"so that you will never feel the need
to devour my energy."
1,13,547,00:41:23:01,00:41:25:04,You will have to go against Park Jin.
1,13,548,00:41:25:06,00:41:28:05,Then I will become just as strong.
1,13,549,00:41:32:12,00:41:35:15,"You lost nine duels in a row
to the mages of Jeongjingak."
1,13,550,00:41:36:19,00:41:38:06,Stop putting on airs.
1,13,551,00:41:41:10,00:41:45:02,"Right, the yin-and-yang jade.
I should get that back first."
1,13,552,00:41:46:03,00:41:49:21,"But how did you call the Crown Prince
through the yin-and-yang jade?"
1,13,553,00:41:51:14,00:41:53:23,There is a way to do that. It really…
1,13,554,00:41:54:22,00:41:56:18,It really makes your heart race.
1,13,555,00:42:16:18,00:42:19:13,"Jang Uk, the so-called intruder,
had no sword."
1,13,556,00:42:20:21,00:42:23:23,"But Jin Mu had one
although he claimed to be innocent."
1,13,557,00:42:36:16,00:42:38:03,Young Master.
1,13,558,00:42:38:05,00:42:41:02,"Master Lee, what are you doing
at our house?"
1,13,559,00:42:41:04,00:42:43:08,"What about you?
Should you not be at Songrim?"
1,13,560,00:42:44:11,00:42:46:04,He is here on probation.
1,13,561,00:42:48:12,00:42:50:07,"""Probation""? Did you get punished?"
1,13,562,00:42:50:23,00:42:52:19,What did you do this time?
1,13,563,00:42:52:21,00:42:54:05,"No, that is not it."
1,13,564,00:42:54:08,00:42:57:03,"Maidservant Kim, do not get too shocked."
1,13,565,00:42:57:06,00:42:58:17,This is sort of like…
1,13,566,00:42:59:24,00:43:01:24,Fake probation.
1,13,567,00:43:02:01,00:43:05:08,"It is more like a vacation
disguised as probation."
1,13,568,00:43:08:12,00:43:09:24,He is right.
1,13,569,00:43:11:08,00:43:12:12,That is good to hear.
1,13,570,00:43:13:15,00:43:16:23,"Let us fish at Lake Gyeongcheondaeho
starting from tomorrow."
1,13,571,00:43:18:06,00:43:19:12,Good idea.
1,13,572,00:43:19:14,00:43:23:23,"You should enjoy your time here
by spending time with Young Master Jang."
1,13,573,00:43:24:00,00:43:24:24,Gosh.
1,13,574,00:43:25:01,00:43:28:16,"No, Maidservant Kim.
I am in no position to slack around."
1,13,575,00:43:28:18,00:43:30:02,"Master Lee, I apologize."
1,13,576,00:43:30:04,00:43:32:18,I have already lost nine out of ten duels.
1,13,577,00:43:32:20,00:43:34:18,I only have one more duel left.
1,13,578,00:43:35:06,00:43:38:03,"I plan to use this time to train.
I hope you understand."
1,13,579,00:43:39:09,00:43:42:10,"You have become very diligent
all of a sudden."
1,13,580,00:43:42:12,00:43:45:16,"Yes, my goal is
to make Maidservant Kim proud."
1,13,581,00:43:45:18,00:43:47:20,I cannot slack around and go fishing.
1,13,582,00:43:48:23,00:43:52:24,"These days, you touch me
with your words every single day."
1,13,583,00:43:53:15,00:43:54:14,All right.
1,13,584,00:43:54:16,00:43:56:03,Go ahead and train.
1,13,585,00:43:56:05,00:43:59:04,"Meanwhile, I will cook
a delicious late-night snack."
1,13,586,00:44:07:20,00:44:11:02,"Tell me the truth.
Why are you on probation?"
1,13,587,00:44:15:00,00:44:17:10,"I went to Cheonbugwan
and broke the constellation basin."
1,13,588,00:44:18:09,00:44:20:04,Please do not tell Maidservant Kim.
1,13,589,00:44:20:07,00:44:23:06,"I did see the lightning strike
from the skies right above Cheonbugwan."
1,13,590,00:44:23:08,00:44:25:02,I guess that hit the constellation basin.
1,13,591,00:44:25:16,00:44:29:12,"We cannot tell you anything in detail,
but it was not Young Master Jang's fault."
1,13,592,00:44:30:21,00:44:33:11,"The leader of Songrim
will tell you what happened."
1,13,593,00:44:35:02,00:44:36:13,I will lend you my fishing rods.
1,13,594,00:44:36:15,00:44:38:11,"Back when I used to enjoy fishing,"
1,13,595,00:44:38:13,00:44:41:03,"I collected several
high-quality fishing rods."
1,13,596,00:44:41:05,00:44:42:08,I will bring them.
1,13,597,00:44:47:10,00:44:48:19,What a pity.
1,13,598,00:44:50:08,00:44:54:06,"I was going to teach him
how to catch a Golden Fish."
1,13,599,00:44:55:01,00:44:56:05,A Golden Fish?
1,13,600,00:44:56:17,00:45:00:04,"You mean the legendary golden fish
that can only be found"
1,13,601,00:45:00:07,00:45:01:24,in Lake Gyeongcheondaeho?
1,13,602,00:45:02:14,00:45:03:20,Do you know what it is?
1,13,603,00:45:03:22,00:45:07:03,"I have heard of it.
A fish that grows with the lake's energy."
1,13,604,00:45:07:05,00:45:11:10,"I heard it can only be caught
by mages who have mastered Chisu or above."
1,13,605,00:45:11:12,00:45:13:19,You really are knowledgeable.
1,13,606,00:45:14:01,00:45:16:07,"That feeling of catching a Golden Fish
as you control"
1,13,607,00:45:16:09,00:45:18:03,the energy of Lake Gyeongcheondaeho…
1,13,608,00:45:19:13,00:45:20:22,It is ecstatic.
1,13,609,00:45:22:03,00:45:25:19,"Please teach Young Master Jang
what that feels like."
1,13,610,00:45:25:21,00:45:26:24,He said he is busy.
1,13,611,00:45:27:14,00:45:29:05,Master Lee.
1,13,612,00:45:29:07,00:45:31:04,"Master Lee, look at this."
1,13,613,00:45:31:06,00:45:33:08,"This is the best one.
It was made with bamboo..."
1,13,614,00:45:33:10,00:45:35:24,"He is not busy. Starting tomorrow,"
1,13,615,00:45:36:01,00:45:39:01,"Young Master Jang
will go fishing with you."
1,13,616,00:45:40:12,00:45:42:12,What do you mean? I need to train.
1,13,617,00:45:42:14,00:45:45:24,"Right now, you need to fish,
not practice with a sword."
1,13,618,00:45:47:04,00:45:50:09,"Go to Lake Gyeongcheondaeho
and catch a Golden Fish."
1,13,619,00:45:50:22,00:45:52:05,What?
1,13,620,00:46:04:15,00:46:06:05,This looks like a nice spot.
1,13,621,00:46:06:18,00:46:08:06,"No, Master Lee."
1,13,622,00:46:08:21,00:46:12:12,"I have fished here before.
The water is too cold here."
1,13,623,00:46:12:15,00:46:15:12,"Fish do not swim here
because there are no lake weeds."
1,13,624,00:46:15:22,00:46:18:22,"On top of that, we did not even bring
any of the nice fishing rods."
1,13,625,00:46:18:24,00:46:22:13,"When catching a Golden Fish,
you must use a rod that bends easily."
1,13,626,00:46:23:10,00:46:25:02,Just like this one.
1,13,627,00:46:26:16,00:46:28:24,Is this bait for the Golden Fish?
1,13,628,00:46:29:11,00:46:30:15,They are snacks.
1,13,629,00:46:30:17,00:46:34:06,"Maidservant Kim packed some snacks
for Master Lee."
1,13,630,00:46:34:20,00:46:37:21,Maidservant Kim is a very kind woman.
1,13,631,00:46:38:08,00:46:40:06,Where is the bait?
1,13,632,00:46:40:08,00:46:42:10,We need worms or mudfish as bait.
1,13,633,00:46:42:12,00:46:44:01,What? My goodness.
1,13,634,00:46:45:15,00:46:47:16,Do you fish with no bait?
1,13,635,00:46:47:19,00:46:51:04,"I told you already.
Golden Fish feed off of energy."
1,13,636,00:46:51:20,00:46:54:15,"My energy will
flow along this bamboo stick,"
1,13,637,00:46:55:02,00:46:57:03,and that will act as bait.
1,13,638,00:46:58:15,00:46:59:18,Your energy?
1,13,639,00:47:00:17,00:47:03:22,"Young Master Jang, go ahead
and follow what he is doing."
1,13,640,00:47:04:09,00:47:05:12,Go on.
1,13,641,00:47:12:08,00:47:16:09,"Now we just need to control
the energy of Lake Gyeongcheondaeho"
1,13,642,00:47:16:11,00:47:18:19,and wait until a Golden Fish bites.
1,13,643,00:47:26:04,00:47:27:09,Mu-deok.
1,13,644,00:47:27:21,00:47:31:01,"I feel like a fool doing this.
Must I continue?"
1,13,645,00:47:38:14,00:47:39:17,It bit!
1,13,646,00:47:50:16,00:47:52:12,That is what you call a Golden Fish.
1,13,647,00:47:53:00,00:47:56:19,"It is a mass of water that is formed
with the energy of Lake Gyeongcheondaeho."
1,13,648,00:47:57:08,00:48:00:14,"Only masters of Chisu and above
who have the ability to control water"
1,13,649,00:48:00:16,00:48:02:11,are able to catch it.
1,13,650,00:48:05:01,00:48:06:11,I have not fished in a long time.
1,13,651,00:48:06:13,00:48:09:24,"But I must say, it still feels great
to catch a Golden Fish."
1,13,652,00:48:12:03,00:48:14:20,So it is not an actual fish?
1,13,653,00:48:15:06,00:48:17:17,Master Lee did not bring you here to fish.
1,13,654,00:48:18:06,00:48:21:11,"He is here to teach you
how to master Chisu."
1,13,655,00:48:22:05,00:48:23:14,Only those who are able
1,13,656,00:48:23:16,00:48:26:16,"to fish out the mass of energy
from Lake Gyeongcheondaeho"
1,13,657,00:48:27:15,00:48:29:12,can master Chisu.
1,13,658,00:48:31:03,00:48:32:14,"""Chisu""?"
1,13,659,00:48:40:22,00:48:42:24,Slowly.
1,13,660,00:48:43:04,00:48:44:06,All right.
1,13,661,00:48:44:08,00:48:47:09,"No, you are too hasty. Slow and steady."
1,13,662,00:48:47:24,00:48:49:14,"- Slowly.
- No."
1,13,663,00:49:02:13,00:49:04:18,"Cheonbugwan must have found
another blind lady."
1,13,664,00:49:04:20,00:49:07:05,"Young Lady Jin says
they bring in several blind ladies"
1,13,665,00:49:07:07,00:49:09:08,from all over the country every day.
1,13,666,00:49:11:19,00:49:13:19,"- Let us go.
- All right."
1,13,667,00:49:26:02,00:49:28:03,So are you saying
1,13,668,00:49:28:05,00:49:31:02,"there could be a soul shifter
hidden inside every family"
1,13,669,00:49:31:04,00:49:33:05,that took part in murdering Naksu's father
1,13,670,00:49:33:07,00:49:35:10,and that we should use Jinyowon's relics
1,13,671,00:49:36:08,00:49:37:12,to find them?
1,13,672,00:49:37:14,00:49:39:20,"We were going to wait
until the soul shifter"
1,13,673,00:49:39:22,00:49:42:07,"that ran wild at Daegangtongun
regained consciousness,"
1,13,674,00:49:42:09,00:49:44:04,but we cannot do nothing until then.
1,13,675,00:49:44:06,00:49:45:20,"The truth is,"
1,13,676,00:49:46:15,00:49:48:22,"last night, we found another soul shifter."
1,13,677,00:49:50:00,00:49:51:09,"Yes, I heard."
1,13,678,00:49:51:11,00:49:55:00,"The soul shifter of a eunuch
was found in Cheonbugwan."
1,13,679,00:49:55:02,00:49:58:13,Jin Mu must have already paid you a visit.
1,13,680,00:49:59:09,00:50:04:00,"My brother, Jin Mu, told me that
Songrim sent an intruder to Cheonbugwan"
1,13,681,00:50:04:12,00:50:07:18,and tried to frame him. He was very upset.
1,13,682,00:50:07:20,00:50:11:02,"If we want to find out if he is innocent
or is actually using sorcery,"
1,13,683,00:50:11:16,00:50:15:16,"we need the relics of Jinyowon
and the power of its leader."
1,13,684,00:50:15:19,00:50:17:05,Please help me.
1,13,685,00:50:18:22,00:50:20:01,"I am sorry,"
1,13,686,00:50:21:10,00:50:22:23,but I refuse.
1,13,687,00:50:24:20,00:50:28:17,"It is extremely disgraceful for a mage
to be accused of sorcery."
1,13,688,00:50:29:10,00:50:30:21,If we go around
1,13,689,00:50:30:23,00:50:35:08,"investigating mages with our relics
without any kind of clear evidence,"
1,13,690,00:50:36:03,00:50:38:22,"it will anger many people
and cause them to resent Jinyowon."
1,13,691,00:50:38:24,00:50:40:11,I heard Jin Mu
1,13,692,00:50:41:05,00:50:44:01,"has been in search
of your eldest daughter."
1,13,693,00:50:44:20,00:50:48:07,"Did he ask you
not to cooperate with Songrim"
1,13,694,00:50:48:16,00:50:51:01,"in return for helping you
find your daughter?"
1,13,695,00:50:51:12,00:50:53:09,"- That is irrelevant.
- No, it is not."
1,13,696,00:50:53:11,00:50:57:24,"Your recent attitude toward Songrim
has suddenly changed."
1,13,697,00:50:58:01,00:51:01:12,"Do you always expect me
to do what you tell me to do?"
1,13,698,00:51:01:15,00:51:03:02,Is that the attitude you want?
1,13,699,00:51:04:09,00:51:08:07,"We, the people of Jinyowon,
do not take orders"
1,13,700,00:51:08:09,00:51:09:22,from Songrim.
1,13,701,00:51:09:24,00:51:11:23,"- Lady Jin...
- Please leave."
1,13,702,00:51:12:10,00:51:15:15,There is someone I must meet.
1,13,703,00:51:26:07,00:51:29:06,"Once they find your older sister,"
1,13,704,00:51:29:08,00:51:32:18,"there will no longer be
any obstacles to our love."
1,13,705,00:51:32:20,00:51:36:07,"That is because Songrim and Jinyowon
have a close relationship."
1,13,706,00:51:36:19,00:51:38:03,"Oh, and…"
1,13,707,00:51:40:14,00:51:41:21,Here.
1,13,708,00:51:43:05,00:51:45:23,"This is the ornament
that I said was pretty last time."
1,13,709,00:51:46:11,00:51:48:19,I thought someone had already bought it.
1,13,710,00:51:48:21,00:51:50:11,How did you get it?
1,13,711,00:51:50:13,00:51:53:15,"I paid that person
four times its original price."
1,13,712,00:51:53:17,00:51:55:10,I thought you might like it.
1,13,713,00:51:55:12,00:51:57:17,I am extremely happy.
1,13,714,00:51:58:12,00:52:01:06,The fact that you are happy
1,13,715,00:52:01:08,00:52:05:04,makes me the happiest man in the world.
1,13,716,00:52:16:03,00:52:18:01,Why does Uncle look so upset?
1,13,717,00:52:18:03,00:52:19:15,Did something happen?
1,13,718,00:52:20:12,00:52:23:06,"I think he had a big argument
with the leader of Jinyowon."
1,13,719,00:52:42:23,00:52:45:11,"I drew a dark red mole
behind her left ear."
1,13,720,00:52:46:24,00:52:51:05,"Bu-yeon fell as a child,
which left a scar on her left arm."
1,13,721,00:52:53:14,00:52:56:04,"Its length was
about one-third of a finger."
1,13,722,00:53:28:10,00:53:31:17,"You must go through this
to become Jin Bu-yeon, so endure it."
1,13,723,00:53:32:16,00:53:34:12,"We will engrave every little mole, scar,"
1,13,724,00:53:34:14,00:53:37:22,"and any other detail that
a mother would remember."
1,13,725,00:53:39:16,00:53:40:18,Yes.
1,13,726,00:53:40:21,00:53:44:12,"I will pour acid on your skin
so that the scar will become more clear."
1,13,727,00:54:28:02,00:54:31:12,"What kind of fish is Young Master Jang
trying to catch?"
1,13,728,00:54:31:15,00:54:33:11,All he does is go to that lake.
1,13,729,00:54:33:23,00:54:36:12,I should go and bring them their food.
1,13,730,00:54:36:14,00:54:38:14,I will ask Mr. Lee to do that.
1,13,731,00:54:38:16,00:54:40:22,"I want you to stay
and help me with something."
1,13,732,00:54:42:15,00:54:46:16,"We need to clean the house
and cook for a memorial service."
1,13,733,00:54:48:00,00:54:49:07,Whose memorial service?
1,13,734,00:54:49:09,00:54:51:17,A young girl who died a pitiful death.
1,13,735,00:54:52:02,00:54:54:08,"She had an ill-fated relationship
with our family,"
1,13,736,00:54:54:10,00:54:56:13,"so I wish to hold
a memorial service for her."
1,13,737,00:54:57:24,00:54:59:07,Maidservant Kim.
1,13,738,00:54:59:09,00:55:00:22,I am back from the temple.
1,13,739,00:55:00:24,00:55:02:03,"- All right.
- Here."
1,13,740,00:55:02:05,00:55:04:16,The Buddhist monk wrote an oration.
1,13,741,00:55:05:22,00:55:07:18,"Goodness, this is great."
1,13,742,00:55:08:17,00:55:10:07,But where are their names?
1,13,743,00:55:10:09,00:55:12:13,"He should have written the names
of the spirits."
1,13,744,00:55:12:16,00:55:13:23,Goodness.
1,13,745,00:55:14:00,00:55:16:23,"It is right there.
""Cho Chung and Cho Yeong."""
1,13,746,00:55:18:03,00:55:20:12,Cho Yeong? That is my name.
1,13,747,00:55:20:23,00:55:22:23,"Oh, yes. I see it now."
1,13,748,00:55:23:00,00:55:24:17,"""Cho Chung and Cho Yeong."""
1,13,749,00:55:25:24,00:55:27:08,What a nice oration.
1,13,750,00:55:27:10,00:55:29:22,"Mr. Lee, come with me."
1,13,751,00:55:30:01,00:55:32:00,"I need you to deliver food
to Young Master Jang."
1,13,752,00:55:32:03,00:55:33:09,All right.
1,13,753,00:55:34:15,00:55:36:20,"Is Maidservant Kim
holding a memorial service"
1,13,754,00:55:37:13,00:55:39:18,for me and my father?
1,13,755,00:56:18:04,00:56:20:13,"It is mushroom rice, my favorite."
1,13,756,00:56:20:15,00:56:24:00,Maidservant Kim is such a great cook.
1,13,757,00:56:31:02,00:56:32:15,It bit! I got one!
1,13,758,00:56:43:00,00:56:45:15,"I put a worm on the hook earlier.
That is what it bit."
1,13,759,00:56:46:16,00:56:48:09,We can have it as a side dish.
1,13,760,00:56:53:19,00:56:55:07,My gosh.
1,13,761,00:57:13:00,00:57:14:03,Here.
1,13,762,00:57:19:23,00:57:21:19,Do not rush yourself.
1,13,763,00:57:23:05,00:57:25:20,"One day, you will feel
the same feeling that you feel"
1,13,764,00:57:25:22,00:57:28:06,when a fish bites into a hook.
1,13,765,00:57:28:09,00:57:32:01,"That is what you call Chisu,
the ability to control energy."
1,13,766,00:57:33:16,00:57:34:19,I see.
1,13,767,00:57:35:18,00:57:38:20,"Master Lee, you even taught me
how to read Words of the Heart."
1,13,768,00:57:39:10,00:57:41:21,May I ask why you keep trying to help me?
1,13,769,00:57:42:23,00:57:45:24,"By any chance, is it because of a reason"
1,13,770,00:57:46:08,00:57:49:12,that must be kept a secret?
1,13,771,00:57:51:07,00:57:52:19,It is not your concern.
1,13,772,00:57:52:21,00:57:54:16,Did you think I would not know?
1,13,773,00:57:57:01,00:57:58:16,It is regarding my family.
1,13,774,00:58:03:13,00:58:05:05,It is because of Maidservant Kim?
1,13,775,00:58:07:00,00:58:10:07,"I mean, you compliment her nonstop."
1,13,776,00:58:10:10,00:58:12:18,And that scarf you are wearing.
1,13,777,00:58:12:20,00:58:15:06,"That is from the shop
that Maidservant Kim goes to."
1,13,778,00:58:16:03,00:58:17:12,"She gave it to you, right?"
1,13,779,00:58:18:10,00:58:19:15,"And most importantly,"
1,13,780,00:58:19:17,00:58:23:10,"I saw the dried wildflowers
in Maidservant Kim's room."
1,13,781,00:58:23:12,00:58:25:18,There were a lot of them at Danhyanggok.
1,13,782,00:58:25:20,00:58:27:12,"You gave them to her, did you not?"
1,13,783,00:58:28:24,00:58:31:17,"- Yes, I did.
- Gosh, I knew it."
1,13,784,00:58:32:23,00:58:34:24,But I thought you practiced chastity…
1,13,785,00:58:35:01,00:58:38:10,My feelings for her are not worldly.
1,13,786,00:58:38:22,00:58:41:12,"I just think she is beautiful
and warm-hearted."
1,13,787,00:58:41:15,00:58:43:03,That is all there is to it.
1,13,788,00:58:43:14,00:58:46:15,"That is the same thing
as saying you like her."
1,13,789,00:58:46:17,00:58:48:23,"How can love between
a man and a woman not be worldly?"
1,13,790,00:58:49:07,00:58:50:11,What about you?
1,13,791,00:58:50:21,00:58:54:00,"You are a man and Mu-deok is a woman.
What does that make you two?"
1,13,792,00:58:55:22,00:58:57:15,"Well, as for me…"
1,13,793,00:58:59:02,00:59:00:10,I do like her.
1,13,794,00:59:05:18,00:59:08:17,"I cannot believe I am talking about this
with a man who practices chastity."
1,13,795,00:59:08:19,00:59:12:06,"Anyway, Maidservant Kim
has feelings for someone else."
1,13,796,00:59:12:08,00:59:13:17,I hope you do not get hurt.
1,13,797,00:59:13:20,00:59:15:12,I should be saying that to you.
1,13,798,00:59:16:05,00:59:18:19,I heard Mu-deok likes Yul.
1,13,799,00:59:18:21,00:59:21:15,"Did Dang-go tell you that?
What kind of worldly conversation is that?"
1,13,800,00:59:21:17,00:59:23:16,I do not just spend time with you.
1,13,801,00:59:25:16,00:59:27:10,I learned that worldly conversations
1,13,802,00:59:28:03,00:59:30:03,can sometimes be of help.
1,13,803,00:59:32:03,00:59:34:05,"Thanks to Yul's story
about his first love,"
1,13,804,00:59:34:08,00:59:37:09,"I was able to learn about Naksu,
the assassin."
1,13,805,00:59:40:06,00:59:43:09,"The girl he met at Danhyanggok
when he was young"
1,13,806,00:59:44:08,00:59:45:20,turned out to be Naksu.
1,13,807,00:59:46:20,00:59:48:07,He knew it was her
1,13,808,00:59:48:09,00:59:51:05,"when he saw the whistle he gave her
on Naksu's dead body."
1,13,809,00:59:53:07,00:59:57:11,"I know you overheard my conversation
with Jin at Sejukwon."
1,13,810,01:00:00:02,01:00:02:21,"Then I am guessing
you also know about Naksu's story."
1,13,811,01:00:06:12,01:00:08:13,You should go home early today.
1,13,812,01:00:09:08,01:00:11:01,Maidservant Kim is going to hold
1,13,813,01:00:11:18,01:00:15:05,"a memorial service for the little girl
who died a pitiful death."
1,13,814,01:00:31:14,01:00:33:02,This is good enough.
1,13,815,01:00:33:13,01:00:34:22,The constellation basin is fixed.
1,13,816,01:00:34:24,01:00:37:23,So take all your laborers back to Songrim.
1,13,817,01:00:38:00,01:00:41:03,"No, it is not perfect yet."
1,13,818,01:00:41:05,01:00:42:17,We think it is good enough.
1,13,819,01:00:42:19,01:00:44:00,What is with you?
1,13,820,01:00:44:02,01:00:45:11,"Goodness, look at that."
1,13,821,01:00:45:13,01:00:49:11,"The lower part of the basin
is a different color from the top."
1,13,822,01:00:49:23,01:00:51:24,We should exchange the lower part.
1,13,823,01:00:52:01,01:00:54:05,You have exchanged it many times already.
1,13,824,01:00:54:15,01:00:55:23,We think it is fine.
1,13,825,01:00:56:00,01:00:57:11,The leader of Songrim promised
1,13,826,01:00:57:13,01:01:00:13,"to return the constellation basin
to its original form."
1,13,827,01:01:00:24,01:01:02:22,We cannot let a single mistake slide.
1,13,828,01:01:04:07,01:01:06:24,"The construction normally takes
a day or two at most."
1,13,829,01:01:07:14,01:01:09:05,But it is taking quite a long time.
1,13,830,01:01:09:07,01:01:11:16,"Do you feel uneasy
that we keep coming here?"
1,13,831,01:01:11:18,01:01:13:16,What is there to feel uneasy about?
1,13,832,01:01:13:18,01:01:18:12,"I just think Songrim is
wasting its time and money."
1,13,833,01:01:22:05,01:01:25:13,"Do not worry about money
when it comes to Songrim."
1,13,834,01:01:27:17,01:01:30:09,"Yul, the last time I saw you,
you seemed quite skilled."
1,13,835,01:01:30:11,01:01:32:06,Have you mastered Chisu?
1,13,836,01:01:33:24,01:01:35:04,Yes.
1,13,837,01:01:36:03,01:01:38:10,"Then you must be
the first mage in Jeongjingak"
1,13,838,01:01:38:12,01:01:40:19,to have mastered Chisu.
1,13,839,01:01:41:07,01:01:44:11,"Like father like son.
Your father, Seo Il, must be proud."
1,13,840,01:01:45:08,01:01:47:05,He was a Jeongjingak mage?
1,13,841,01:01:48:18,01:01:50:22,You cannot drag her against her will.
1,13,842,01:01:56:06,01:01:58:01,Can you stand?
1,13,843,01:02:00:04,01:02:01:10,What are you looking at?
1,13,844,01:02:04:13,01:02:06:15,Is he a Jeongjingak mage?
1,13,845,01:02:06:18,01:02:09:04,"- Is his name Seo Yul?
- Yes."
1,13,846,01:02:09:06,01:02:12:01,"They are sons of prestigious families
and are out of your league."
1,13,847,01:02:12:13,01:02:14:14,Do not roam around and stay hidden.
1,13,848,01:02:20:22,01:02:23:22,"He may be out of my league
when I am So-i, a swindling vagabond."
1,13,849,01:02:27:00,01:02:30:02,"But once I become Jin Bu-yeon,
the future leader of Jinyowon,"
1,13,850,01:02:31:15,01:02:33:07,I might have a chance.
1,13,851,01:02:41:23,01:02:44:19,"It is for Master Jang's friend
and that friend's daughter."
1,13,852,01:02:46:24,01:02:48:21,"There are no graves for them,"
1,13,853,01:02:49:18,01:02:52:09,"and I bet no one has held
a memorial service for them."
1,13,854,01:02:52:24,01:02:54:23,So I figured I should at least hold one.
1,13,855,01:02:56:18,01:02:57:24,Maidservant Kim.
1,13,856,01:03:00:18,01:03:02:02,Thank you.
1,13,857,01:03:03:00,01:03:04:11,What?
1,13,858,01:03:06:11,01:03:08:00,That is what they would say.
1,13,859,01:03:08:24,01:03:11:13,I bet they are extremely grateful.
1,13,860,01:03:13:03,01:03:14:22,It relieves me to hear that.
1,13,861,01:03:16:10,01:03:18:21,"Leave the incense sticks
until they burn out."
1,13,862,01:03:46:17,01:03:49:00,"CHO CHUNG, CHO YEONG"
1,13,863,01:04:05:12,01:04:09:14,"CHO CHUNG, CHO YEONG"
1,13,864,01:04:17:15,01:04:18:23,Father…
1,13,865,01:04:31:03,01:04:33:07,Young Master Jang went fishing.
1,13,866,01:04:33:09,01:04:36:05,"He will be back soon,
so you can wait for him inside."
1,13,867,01:04:37:14,01:04:39:10,Did Mu-deok also go with him?
1,13,868,01:04:39:12,01:04:41:17,Mu-deok is at home.
1,13,869,01:04:41:19,01:04:43:15,She had to prepare for a memorial service.
1,13,870,01:04:57:20,01:05:00:08,"CHO CHUNG, CHO YEONG"
1,13,871,01:05:02:20,01:05:04:06,If I had not left you there
1,13,872,01:05:05:12,01:05:07:05,"in the mountains,"
1,13,873,01:05:10:22,01:05:15:04,"you would not have to suffer this fate
where you have to hold your tears"
1,13,874,01:05:15:21,01:05:18:09,and pretend to be someone else.
1,13,875,01:05:23:14,01:05:25:07,"But even now,"
1,13,876,01:05:27:04,01:05:29:18,I cannot seem to step up
1,13,877,01:05:30:14,01:05:32:19,"and tell you that
I know who you really are."
1,13,878,01:05:45:17,01:05:47:11,"CHO CHUNG, CHO YEONG"
1,13,879,01:05:53:10,01:05:54:23,The incense sticks have burned out.
1,13,880,01:05:56:07,01:05:57:11,Yes.
1,13,881,01:05:57:24,01:05:59:04,They have.
1,13,882,01:05:59:15,01:06:00:18,Were you here all along?
1,13,883,01:06:04:01,01:06:05:12,Let us clean up.
1,13,884,01:06:45:07,01:06:48:05,"When did you come back?
I heard you went fishing."
1,13,885,01:06:48:07,01:06:50:08,"Yes, I just got back."
1,13,886,01:06:50:10,01:06:51:18,Are you here alone? Where is Dang-go?
1,13,887,01:06:51:21,01:06:54:14,"He is busy for some reason.
I think he is meeting someone."
1,13,888,01:06:54:16,01:06:56:01,I see.
1,13,889,01:06:57:04,01:06:58:10,What brings you here?
1,13,890,01:06:58:12,01:07:01:16,"The leader ended your probation
and asked you to come back to Songrim."
1,13,891,01:07:02:02,01:07:04:16,That was faster than expected.
1,13,892,01:07:05:11,01:07:08:17,"Have a seat. Let us enjoy some drinks.
I need to talk to you anyway."
1,13,893,01:07:08:19,01:07:10:13,"Unfortunately, I cannot drink."
1,13,894,01:07:11:03,01:07:13:17,"- I have to go back to Songrim.
- All right."
1,13,895,01:07:13:19,01:07:17:00,"Then I will tell you what I wanted to say
tomorrow at Jeongjingak."
1,13,896,01:07:17:11,01:07:19:07,You will be surprised.
1,13,897,01:07:20:20,01:07:24:13,"Uk, I will be returning
to Seoho Fortress soon."
1,13,898,01:07:26:04,01:07:28:01,I promised my father that
1,13,899,01:07:28:03,01:07:30:20,"I would only train at Jeongjingak
until I mastered Chisu."
1,13,900,01:07:31:10,01:07:33:22,"Master Heo wrote my father a letter,"
1,13,901,01:07:33:24,01:07:35:24,so he might order me to return soon.
1,13,902,01:07:36:10,01:07:37:12,Then I will have to go.
1,13,903,01:07:37:14,01:07:39:07,But that place is too far away.
1,13,904,01:07:40:01,01:07:43:02,"Dang-go and I are
going to miss you so much."
1,13,905,01:07:44:16,01:07:46:10,"When I return to Seoho Fortress,"
1,13,906,01:07:48:00,01:07:49:24,there is someone I wish to take with me.
1,13,907,01:07:52:14,01:07:54:16,"- Who?
- I cannot tell you now."
1,13,908,01:07:56:16,01:07:58:01,I will tell you once it is time.
1,13,909,01:08:00:03,01:08:01:24,I will be off now. See you tomorrow.
1,13,910,01:08:02:24,01:08:04:05,All right. Bye.
1,13,911,01:08:38:09,01:08:39:19,Because I missed them.
1,13,912,01:08:39:21,01:08:42:01,I liked them a lot.
1,13,913,01:08:45:18,01:08:48:18,"They can prevent that
by feeding on others' energy."
1,13,914,01:08:48:20,01:08:50:06,"But once they do that,"
1,13,915,01:08:51:05,01:08:53:01,"they will no longer be humans,
but monsters."
1,13,916,01:08:54:00,01:08:56:01,And it is our duty to protect this world…
1,13,917,01:08:56:22,01:08:58:08,From such monsters.
1,13,918,01:09:01:06,01:09:04:13,I wonder if Yul knows everything.
1,13,919,01:09:05:18,01:09:07:17,"When I return to Seoho Fortress,"
1,13,920,01:09:08:03,01:09:10:03,there is someone I wish to take with me.
1,13,921,01:09:16:14,01:09:17:22,Young Master.
1,13,922,01:09:17:24,01:09:19:05,Yes?
1,13,923,01:09:22:03,01:09:25:04,"Is Seo Yul gone?
Maidservant Kim sent this for him."
1,13,924,01:09:32:08,01:09:33:24,I guess he was talking about you.
1,13,925,01:09:34:17,01:09:37:19,"What do you mean?
Did Seo Yul say something?"
1,13,926,01:09:41:05,01:09:42:24,I was told to return to Songrim tomorrow.
1,13,927,01:09:43:18,01:09:45:04,Is that why you look upset?
1,13,928,01:09:45:21,01:09:48:01,Cha Beom will ask you
1,13,929,01:09:48:11,01:09:50:23,"to fight him for your last duel
as soon as you return."
1,13,930,01:09:51:00,01:09:52:13,You must be afraid of losing again.
1,13,931,01:09:53:00,01:09:54:16,I will not lose tomorrow.
1,13,932,01:09:57:06,01:09:58:15,I finally caught it.
1,13,933,01:10:17:20,01:10:20:03,Today is Jang Uk's last duel.
1,13,934,01:10:23:04,01:10:25:10,"I have talked to the person
who I have made this bet with,"
1,13,935,01:10:25:12,01:10:27:09,and the prize for today's winner
1,13,936,01:10:28:02,01:10:30:12,"will not be a gold toad.
It will be something else."
1,13,937,01:10:44:20,01:10:46:12,The winner of today's duel
1,13,938,01:10:47:19,01:10:49:05,will be winning that maid.
1,13,939,01:10:55:10,01:10:57:05,I have agreed to serve…
1,13,940,01:10:59:00,01:11:01:08,The winner of today's duel as my master.
1,13,941,01:11:10:21,01:11:13:03,"- What is going on?
- All right, then."
1,13,942,01:11:13:17,01:11:15:15,"The person fighting Jang Uk
for his last duel."
1,13,943,01:11:16:01,01:11:17:04,Step forward.
1,13,944,01:11:45:11,01:11:46:14,Uk.
1,13,945,01:11:48:07,01:11:50:05,The person you will be fighting against
1,13,946,01:11:51:07,01:11:52:18,is me.
