1,4,"00:00:40,707","00:00:42,707",2.00,1,"My lady, you must stay strong."
1,4,"00:00:42,792","00:00:44,542",1.75,2,You must stay awake.
1,4,"00:00:44,627","00:00:45,837",1.21,3,Please stay strong.
1,4,"00:00:56,306","00:00:58,266",1.96,4,I SHALL MAKE DO-HWA MINE
1,4,"00:00:56,306","00:00:58,266",1.96,5,"IF SHE BEARS A CHILD, KNOW THAT IT IS MINE"
1,4,"00:00:58,349","00:01:04,272",5.92,6,"Thanks to you, the past seven days have been wonderful."
1,4,"00:01:09,235","00:01:13,990",4.75,7,Do-hwa will be giving birth to my son soon.
1,4,"00:01:16,409","00:01:17,539",1.13,8,Your Majesty.
1,4,"00:01:18,244","00:01:22,044",3.80,9,Do you remember the divination I received on the day of my coronation?
1,4,"00:01:22,624","00:01:29,960",7.34,10,You said I would be granted a son who had the energy of the King's Star.
1,4,"00:01:30,548","00:01:34,218",3.67,11,The divination was incorrect.
1,4,"00:01:30,548","00:01:34,218",3.67,12,That cannot be.
1,4,"00:01:36,679","00:01:37,889",1.21,13,No.
1,4,"00:01:39,432","00:01:42,062",2.63,14,What you said has to be true.
1,4,"00:01:43,061","00:01:46,191",3.13,15,I will have a son thanks to your alchemy of souls.
1,4,"00:01:47,982","00:01:49,692",1.71,16,Remember that.
1,4,"00:01:50,902","00:01:56,157",5.25,17,Do-hwa will bear my son.
1,4,"00:01:59,202","00:02:00,542",1.34,18,He will be mine.
1,4,"00:02:59,012","00:03:07,354",8.34,19,The star at the center of the Big Dipper that contains nature's secrets only reveals itself when the sky is filled with the energy of the Daeho waters.
1,4,"00:03:15,361","00:03:18,201",2.84,20,And my son will be born when that star appears.
1,4,"00:03:28,583","00:03:31,963",3.38,21,"From this moment forward, I hereby banish Jang Uk from Songrim."
1,4,"00:03:33,296","00:03:34,626",1.33,22,There is one more left.
1,4,"00:03:34,714","00:03:36,094",1.38,23,"As for the last one, you should do it yourself."
1,4,"00:03:51,981","00:03:53,071",1.09,24,Mu-deok.
1,4,"00:03:54,317","00:03:57,697",3.38,25,Is Young Master still not talking?
1,4,"00:03:58,738","00:04:02,698",3.96,26,"No. His back was flogged, but it seems his mouth was as well."
1,4,"00:04:02,784","00:04:05,204",2.42,27,He cries in pain even when he bumps his fingers into something.
1,4,"00:04:05,286","00:04:07,956",2.67,28,But he is being silent after being flogged 100 times.
1,4,"00:04:08,039","00:04:09,119",1.08,29,I am truly worried.
1,4,"00:04:09,207","00:04:12,287",3.08,30,"He is a crybaby, so I am guessing it is still bearable for him."
1,4,"00:04:13,711","00:04:17,761",4.05,31,His back is not what is paining him.
1,4,"00:04:13,711","00:04:17,761",4.05,32,It is his heart.
1,4,"00:04:18,883","00:04:22,803",3.92,33,He was cast away by the man he considered a father figure.
1,4,"00:04:22,887","00:04:24,427",1.54,34,Imagine how he feels.
1,4,"00:04:25,765","00:04:27,555",1.79,35,He must think he was abandoned.
1,4,"00:04:51,582","00:04:53,462",1.88,36,You should be happy you got flogged.
1,4,"00:04:54,168","00:04:57,338",3.17,37,They will not be able to retrieve the torrent of energy right away.
1,4,"00:04:57,422","00:04:59,342",1.92,38,You will have more time to train.
1,4,"00:05:10,351","00:05:11,481",1.13,39,Young Master.
1,4,"00:05:12,312","00:05:13,312",1.00,40,Are you all right?
1,4,"00:05:33,624","00:05:35,754",2.13,41,"Mu-deok, look at this."
1,4,"00:05:35,835","00:05:38,125",2.29,42,I think I used my energy to make these ripples.
1,4,"00:05:42,967","00:05:44,387",1.42,43,The water is just rippling.
1,4,"00:05:46,095","00:05:48,885",2.79,44,Why is it not working? I have been practicing my breathing technique.
1,4,"00:05:48,973","00:05:51,313",2.34,45,Is that what you have been doing in silence?
1,4,"00:05:51,392","00:05:54,602",3.21,46,I thought you were wallowing in sadness for being abandoned.
1,4,"00:05:54,687","00:05:57,267",2.58,47,I was wrong.
1,4,"00:05:54,687","00:05:57,267",2.58,48,Wallowing in sadness?
1,4,"00:05:57,356","00:05:59,356",2.00,49,I was abandoned from the moment I was born.
1,4,"00:05:59,442","00:06:01,692",2.25,50,And this is not my first time getting kicked out.
1,4,"00:06:01,778","00:06:03,238",1.46,51,It does not faze me.
1,4,"00:06:09,035","00:06:10,535",1.50,52,Just wait and see.
1,4,"00:06:10,620","00:06:14,040",3.42,53,I will make them beg me to come back to Songrim.
1,4,"00:06:15,458","00:06:17,128",1.67,54,I guess being stupid can be helpful at times.
1,4,"00:06:17,710","00:06:18,710",1.00,55,I am acting with vigor.
1,4,"00:06:22,340","00:06:25,090",2.75,56,"By the way, why is it so hot in here?"
1,4,"00:06:25,718","00:06:27,598",1.88,57,Hot? I am cold.
1,4,"00:06:30,348","00:06:32,138",1.79,58,Why did the water become so hot?
1,4,"00:06:34,477","00:06:35,977",1.50,59,Why are you burning up?
1,4,"00:06:36,938","00:06:40,688",3.75,60,I feel strange.
1,4,"00:06:36,938","00:06:40,688",3.75,61,I think my body is getting hotter.
1,4,"00:06:40,775","00:06:42,105",1.33,62,It is the energy.
1,4,"00:06:43,236","00:06:44,446",1.21,63,But this soon?
1,4,"00:06:47,323","00:06:48,913",1.59,64,It was the flogging.
1,4,"00:06:48,991","00:06:51,161",2.17,65,It caused the torrent of energy to surge faster.
1,4,"00:06:51,911","00:06:53,581",1.67,66,I am glad you got flogged.
1,4,"00:06:56,499","00:06:58,249",1.75,67,"Mu-deok, I am burning up."
1,4,"00:06:58,334","00:07:01,674",3.34,68,You will burn up once the torrent of energy transforms into heat.
1,4,"00:07:01,754","00:07:03,884",2.13,69,Then you will feel chilly when it becomes cold.
1,4,"00:07:03,965","00:07:06,585",2.62,70,That energy will be yours only if you can bear that.
1,4,"00:07:07,760","00:07:10,560",2.80,71,Keep breathing slowly.
1,4,"00:07:18,396","00:07:19,806",1.41,72,This is cold water.
1,4,"00:07:33,494","00:07:34,624",1.13,73,Mu-deok.
1,4,"00:07:35,371","00:07:37,041",1.67,74,Is Young Master still bathing?
1,4,"00:07:37,123","00:07:39,083",1.96,75,It has been almost an hour.
1,4,"00:07:39,750","00:07:43,880",4.13,76,"If she finds out, she will tell Songrim."
1,4,"00:07:39,750","00:07:43,880",4.13,77,Then we will lose the torrent of energy.
1,4,"00:07:43,963","00:07:44,843",0.88,78,Medicinal herbs.
1,4,"00:07:46,382","00:07:48,632",2.25,79,He is bathing in medicinal herbs.
1,4,"00:07:49,218","00:07:53,852",4.63,80,I have dissolved some medicinal herbs and let him bathe in them to treat his wounds.
1,4,"00:07:55,099","00:07:55,929",0.83,81,Is that so?
1,4,"00:07:57,310","00:07:58,560",1.25,82,Good thinking.
1,4,"00:08:01,647","00:08:02,727",1.08,83,Hold on.
1,4,"00:08:09,906","00:08:11,736",1.83,84,Then why is the water cold?
1,4,"00:08:11,824","00:08:13,034",1.21,85,Sorry?
1,4,"00:08:13,117","00:08:16,077",2.96,86,The water must have cooled down in the past hour.
1,4,"00:08:16,162","00:08:18,082",1.92,87,So why are you not bringing him hot water?
1,4,"00:08:20,791","00:08:22,251",1.46,88,Is he running a fever?
1,4,"00:08:24,086","00:08:25,246",1.16,89,Young Master.
1,4,"00:08:30,468","00:08:31,468",1.00,90,That is so cold.
1,4,"00:08:32,178","00:08:33,758",1.58,91,How could you let this happen?
1,4,"00:08:33,846","00:08:35,306",1.46,92,What if he catches a cold?
1,4,"00:08:42,146","00:08:45,066",2.92,93,The boiling hot water became ice-cold.
1,4,"00:08:45,149","00:08:46,229",1.08,94,Young Master.
1,4,"00:08:47,777","00:08:49,067",1.29,95,Where did he go?
1,4,"00:08:49,946","00:08:50,856",0.91,96,Goodness.
1,4,"00:08:54,825","00:08:57,285",2.46,97,"Young Master, are you all right?"
1,4,"00:08:57,995","00:08:59,205",1.21,98,Yes.
1,4,"00:08:59,288","00:09:02,538",3.25,99,Bathing in medicinal herbs has made me relaxed but drowsy.
1,4,"00:09:05,336","00:09:07,876",2.54,100,"Come on, now. Go on and make his bed."
1,4,"00:09:09,173","00:09:12,473",3.30,101,It is the cold. His body is freezing now.
1,4,"00:09:18,683","00:09:21,773",3.09,102,I am freezing.
1,4,"00:09:18,683","00:09:21,773",3.09,103,I think I am covered in ice.
1,4,"00:09:22,687","00:09:26,397",3.71,104,It is the cold. Your energy is surging faster than I thought.
1,4,"00:09:27,650","00:09:28,820",1.17,105,Keep breathing.
1,4,"00:09:54,510","00:09:55,970",1.46,106,I am freezing. I think I might faint.
1,4,"00:09:58,180","00:10:00,270",2.09,107,Fight it. You must.
1,4,"00:10:02,643","00:10:05,193",2.55,108,Jang Uk! Stay alert.
1,4,"00:10:05,271","00:10:07,061",1.79,109,You could freeze to death if you fall asleep now.
1,4,"00:10:07,148","00:10:08,268",1.12,110,Get up.
1,4,"00:10:10,818","00:10:12,068",1.25,111,Keep breathing.
1,4,"00:10:23,039","00:10:26,539",3.50,112,"Uncle, Yul and I are the only friends Uk has."
1,4,"00:10:26,626","00:10:29,126",2.50,113,He has nowhere but Songrim to call home.
1,4,"00:10:29,211","00:10:32,011",2.80,114,Please let him return to Songrim.
1,4,"00:10:32,089","00:10:33,799",1.71,115,He will not be able to train anyway.
1,4,"00:10:34,300","00:10:38,352",4.05,116,No one will take him in once they find out he has been ousted from Songrim.
1,4,"00:10:39,889","00:10:41,769",1.88,117,Stop talking about Uk.
1,4,"00:10:41,849","00:10:45,099",3.25,118,I want you to focus on the soul shifter case from now on.
1,4,"00:10:53,944","00:10:56,244",2.30,119,He has completely hardened like stone.
1,4,"00:10:57,531","00:10:58,911",1.38,120,He has been petrified.
1,4,"00:11:02,370","00:11:07,001",4.63,121,A soul shifter who has run wild replaces their lost energy by absorbing that of a human.
1,4,"00:11:09,251","00:11:11,301",2.05,122,He is no different from an evil spirit.
1,4,"00:11:11,379","00:11:14,009",2.63,123,I can see why you forbid this sorcery.
1,4,"00:11:14,090","00:11:16,970",2.88,124,The alchemy of souls was not a type of sorcery from the start.
1,4,"00:11:17,551","00:11:22,681",5.13,125,"You can only perform this once you have mastered Jipsu, Ryusu, Chisu, and ultimately, Hwansu."
1,4,"00:11:22,765","00:11:27,770",5.00,126,Hwansu is the godlike power of changing water to fire and vice versa. Is it not?
1,4,"00:11:27,853","00:11:30,063",2.21,127,Humans cannot reach that level.
1,4,"00:11:27,853","00:11:30,063",2.21,128,Right.
1,4,"00:11:30,147","00:11:32,727",2.58,129,"But Master Seo Gyeong, the founder of Songrim, did."
1,4,"00:11:32,817","00:11:34,567",1.75,130,There was also someone else.
1,4,"00:11:34,652","00:11:35,692",1.04,131,Who?
1,4,"00:11:35,778","00:11:37,698",1.92,132,As if you would know his name.
1,4,"00:11:39,156","00:11:44,579",5.42,133,Who dared to perform the alchemy of souls on this poor Songrim pupil?
1,4,"00:11:44,662","00:11:48,372",3.71,134,He was meant to work at Cheonbugwan and record the constellations.
1,4,"00:11:48,457","00:11:50,707",2.25,135,He had been frequenting the place for a few months.
1,4,"00:11:51,627","00:11:56,716",5.09,136,Right. They were the ones who caught Naksu's men whom we had failed to catch as if they had been waiting.
1,4,"00:11:56,799","00:12:01,431",4.63,137,I am certain that they have something to do with this soul shifter case.
1,4,"00:12:03,389","00:12:08,097",4.71,138,"Yul and Dang-gu, keep an eye on Cheonbugwan and see if there is anything strange."
1,4,"00:12:08,686","00:12:09,556",0.87,139,"Yes, my lord."
1,4,"00:12:08,686","00:12:09,556",0.87,140,"Yes, my lord."
1,4,"00:12:12,064","00:12:13,654",1.59,141,What is wrong with that?
1,4,"00:12:13,732","00:12:16,032",2.30,142,It has been malfunctioning ever since Uk broke it.
1,4,"00:12:17,069","00:12:19,159",2.09,143,Jang Uk…
1,4,"00:12:17,069","00:12:19,159",2.09,144,Do not move!
1,4,"00:12:19,864","00:12:21,074",1.21,145,It will crumble.
1,4,"00:12:24,493","00:12:25,833",1.34,146,Do not move.
1,4,"00:12:26,412","00:12:28,122",1.71,147,Wait until the door completely shuts.
1,4,"00:12:29,206","00:12:30,076",0.87,148,Jang Uk!
1,4,"00:12:30,624","00:12:33,504",2.88,149,I told you not to move!
1,4,"00:12:33,586","00:12:35,336",1.75,150,Help me!
1,4,"00:12:37,465","00:12:38,585",1.12,151,Stay still.
1,4,"00:12:39,967","00:12:41,007",1.04,152,Jang Uk…
1,4,"00:13:12,333","00:13:14,253",1.92,153,Stay down for a moment.
1,4,"00:13:32,853","00:13:34,063",1.21,154,Sapsali.
1,4,"00:13:35,064","00:13:36,234",1.17,155,Come out.
1,4,"00:13:36,941","00:13:38,651",1.71,156,Come with me.
1,4,"00:14:23,153","00:14:24,953",1.80,157,I am glad you are back.
1,4,"00:14:28,617","00:14:32,867",4.25,158,I will reward you with delicious treats if you find the soul shifters.
1,4,"00:14:32,955","00:14:34,455",1.50,159,I hope we get along.
1,4,"00:15:04,653","00:15:05,783",1.13,160,Mu-deok.
1,4,"00:15:07,656","00:15:16,920",9.26,161,"If I freeze to death, take the torrent of energy… within me if you can."
1,4,"00:15:18,208","00:15:21,088",2.88,162,"If I could, I would have killed you and done that already."
1,4,"00:15:24,006","00:15:25,666",1.66,163,I am freezing to death here.
1,4,"00:15:27,259","00:15:29,259",2.00,164,Do not say such coldhearted things.
1,4,"00:15:31,263","00:15:32,773",1.51,165,Say something heartwarming.
1,4,"00:15:33,349","00:15:35,429",2.08,166,Have you finally gone mad?
1,4,"00:15:35,517","00:15:36,807",1.29,167,What is with you?
1,4,"00:15:41,649","00:15:43,729",2.08,168,Jang Uk. Open your eyes.
1,4,"00:15:44,526","00:15:47,446",2.92,169,Fine. I will say something heartwarming.
1,4,"00:15:50,366","00:15:53,826",3.46,170,There was a huge tree where I used to live.
1,4,"00:15:55,746","00:15:58,616",2.87,171,And there was a bird's nest on top.
1,4,"00:15:59,291","00:16:01,041",1.75,172,The egg inside it was warm.
1,4,"00:16:02,544","00:16:03,924",1.38,173,Did you eat it?
1,4,"00:16:04,922","00:16:06,922",2.00,174,I said this would be heartwarming.
1,4,"00:16:12,304","00:16:14,974",2.67,175,The mother bird always came by and sat on the egg.
1,4,"00:16:19,436","00:16:23,856",4.42,176,I am the egg that is at the top of the tree.
1,4,"00:16:27,277","00:16:32,661",5.38,177,I know no one… and I am powerless.
1,4,"00:16:36,829","00:16:39,419",2.59,178,You are the only one who can take care of me.
1,4,"00:16:43,460","00:16:47,835",4.38,179,My life… is in your hands.
1,4,"00:16:55,305","00:16:56,595",1.29,180,How heartwarming.
1,4,"00:17:02,730","00:17:04,020",1.29,181,Keep going.
1,4,"00:17:08,444","00:17:11,494",3.05,182,There was also a cave where I lived.
1,4,"00:17:13,782","00:17:16,042",2.26,183,A bear cub was living inside…
1,4,"00:17:47,066","00:17:49,436",2.37,184,You cannot even take out your own father's sword.
1,4,"00:17:49,526","00:17:51,276",1.75,185,How do you expect to learn spells?
1,4,"00:17:53,030","00:17:57,704",4.67,186,No one in Daeho will be able to go against your father and open your gate of energy.
1,4,"00:17:57,785","00:18:03,170",5.38,187,That was the fate given to you by your father.
1,4,"00:18:24,520","00:18:25,690",1.17,188,You are not ready yet.
1,4,"00:18:31,985","00:18:38,162",6.18,189,"To unsheathe a mage's sword, you must master Ryusu and be able to channel your energy outward."
1,4,"00:18:38,951","00:18:42,161",3.21,190,You cannot do it just yet since you cannot control your energy.
1,4,"00:18:42,913","00:18:45,793",2.88,191,My father left this sword behind when he abandoned me.
1,4,"00:18:45,874","00:18:48,094",2.22,192,And I can only join Songrim if I unsheathe it.
1,4,"00:18:50,838","00:18:52,918",2.08,193,I want to unsheathe it and show them.
1,4,"00:18:54,133","00:18:55,473",1.34,194,Is that an act of stupidity?
1,4,"00:18:55,551","00:18:56,841",1.29,195,"No, it is an act of vigor."
1,4,"00:18:59,096","00:19:01,966",2.87,196,"Stay strong, Jang Uk."
1,4,"00:19:21,034","00:19:22,164",1.13,197,Your Royal Highness.
1,4,"00:19:22,244","00:19:24,714",2.47,198,"We have arrived at Cheonbugwan's Gwanju, Jang Gang's house."
1,4,"00:19:29,042","00:19:30,252",1.21,199,Young Master!
1,4,"00:19:32,296","00:19:34,666",2.37,200,You have a guest.
1,4,"00:19:35,382","00:19:36,302",0.92,201,Who is it?
1,4,"00:19:36,383","00:19:39,643",3.26,202,The Crown Prince has come to see you.
1,4,"00:20:01,992","00:20:08,082",6.09,203,This is the perfect weather to go fishing with Uk by Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.
1,4,"00:20:10,167","00:20:12,957",2.79,204,I wonder if he has recovered from the flogging.
1,4,"00:20:14,546","00:20:16,626",2.08,205,I am going to see him since I am worried.
1,4,"00:20:16,715","00:20:18,375",1.66,206,But why are you tagging along?
1,4,"00:20:19,801","00:20:21,181",1.38,207,I need to check something.
1,4,"00:20:21,261","00:20:23,391",2.13,208,There is something I told his maid.
1,4,"00:20:23,472","00:20:24,312",0.84,209,I see.
1,4,"00:20:24,389","00:20:27,019",2.63,210,I understand that we are visiting him as friends.
1,4,"00:20:27,100","00:20:28,690",1.59,211,But why are you here?
1,4,"00:20:29,811","00:20:31,941",2.13,212,I just happened to run into you.
1,4,"00:20:32,022","00:20:35,692",3.67,213,And I had something to nitpick him about. That is why.
1,4,"00:20:35,776","00:20:38,316",2.54,214,I see. You are going to nitpick.
1,4,"00:20:38,904","00:20:40,454",1.55,215,What is in that bundle?
1,4,"00:20:43,325","00:20:45,485",2.16,216,It is medicine to treat his wounds.
1,4,"00:20:46,036","00:20:49,826",3.79,217,I see. You are going to give him some medicine before nitpicking at him.
1,4,"00:20:51,041","00:20:53,341",2.30,218,I see. How incredible.
1,4,"00:20:55,379","00:20:57,549",2.17,219,You are here for Naksu's sword?
1,4,"00:20:57,631","00:20:59,551",1.92,220,The King has entrusted Cheonbugwan with it.
1,4,"00:21:00,050","00:21:03,300",3.25,221,"Jin Mu, the Assistant Gwanju, should take it since the Gwanju is absent."
1,4,"00:21:07,516","00:21:10,306",2.79,222,"Since you came here yourself, I will hand it over to you."
1,4,"00:21:10,394","00:21:11,484",1.09,223,You can take it.
1,4,"00:21:12,104","00:21:12,944",0.84,224,Bring it here.
1,4,"00:21:14,731","00:21:15,861",1.13,225,And one more thing.
1,4,"00:21:16,608","00:21:18,988",2.38,226,There is another sword here that you cannot unsheathe.
1,4,"00:21:20,654","00:21:24,164",3.51,227,The late king had bestowed it on Gwanju Jang Gang.
1,4,"00:21:24,783","00:21:26,373",1.59,228,I would like to take that as well.
1,4,"00:21:26,451","00:21:29,251",2.80,229,But that belongs to his father.
1,4,"00:21:29,955","00:21:31,665",1.71,230,He has the right to keep it.
1,4,"00:21:31,748","00:21:33,288",1.54,231,He was never entrusted with it.
1,4,"00:21:34,668","00:21:36,878",2.21,232,I heard Songrim had kept it all this time.
1,4,"00:21:36,962","00:21:39,882",2.92,233,"You only took it after being kicked out, did you not?"
1,4,"00:21:41,591","00:21:45,101",3.51,234,The royal palace will keep it until a new Gwanju is instated.
1,4,"00:21:46,930","00:21:48,060",1.13,235,Bring it to me.
1,4,"00:21:55,397","00:21:56,897",1.50,236,I cannot.
1,4,"00:21:58,525","00:22:02,315",3.79,237,"As you already know, no one acknowledges him as my father."
1,4,"00:22:03,864","00:22:06,624",2.76,238,It will not bode well for me if I lose that sword as well.
1,4,"00:22:07,743","00:22:10,253",2.51,239,"I will keep it, even if it means using it as decoration."
1,4,"00:22:13,874","00:22:18,958",5.08,240,"I must take it with me, but you refuse. It cannot be helped."
1,4,"00:22:21,298","00:22:22,968",1.67,241,Whoever wins shall take the sword.
1,4,"00:22:41,026","00:22:43,646",2.62,242,You are not fully trained for a true fight.
1,4,"00:22:50,535","00:22:54,578",4.04,243,"If you can push me over this line, I will leave."
1,4,"00:23:09,304","00:23:13,934",4.63,244,I am sure you expected me to grovel in humiliation.
1,4,"00:23:15,268","00:23:18,608",3.34,245,Going against you would be an act of stupidity.
1,4,"00:23:18,688","00:23:21,318",2.63,246,"However, there is someone who sees it as one of vigor."
1,4,"00:23:21,399","00:23:22,439",1.04,247,So I shall try.
1,4,"00:24:15,829","00:24:17,159",1.33,248,It is the energy.
1,4,"00:24:17,247","00:24:18,537",1.29,249,It was the flogging.
1,4,"00:24:18,623","00:24:20,673",2.05,250,It caused the torrent of energy to surge faster.
1,4,"00:24:21,543","00:24:22,543",1.00,251,I am glad you got flogged.
1,4,"00:24:23,170","00:24:26,880",3.71,252,All right. You can hit me as much as you want.
1,4,"00:25:46,002","00:25:47,302",1.30,253,Step back!
1,4,"00:25:47,921","00:25:49,671",1.75,254,Step back! This is from the chamber pots!
1,4,"00:26:02,060","00:26:03,600",1.54,255,What did you just do?
1,4,"00:26:05,021","00:26:05,901",0.88,256,Who is she?
1,4,"00:26:07,315","00:26:10,145",2.83,257,I serve this young master.
1,4,"00:26:07,315","00:26:10,145",2.83,258,How dare a maid intervene?
1,4,"00:26:13,863","00:26:15,283",1.42,259,"My apologies, Your Royal Highness."
1,4,"00:26:15,365","00:26:17,025",1.66,260,My maid was impudent.
1,4,"00:26:19,619","00:26:20,539",0.92,261,What is this?
1,4,"00:26:23,331","00:26:25,791",2.46,262,That is disgusting.
1,4,"00:26:25,875","00:26:27,875",2.00,263,You should return home and get changed.
1,4,"00:26:28,378","00:26:30,548",2.17,264,What?
1,4,"00:26:28,378","00:26:30,548",2.17,265,You stepped over the line.
1,4,"00:26:33,633","00:26:37,796",4.16,266,"You may have stepped back to avoid the filthy water, but you still lost."
1,4,"00:26:37,887","00:26:41,267",3.38,267,Please keep your word and let me have my father's sword.
1,4,"00:26:42,267","00:26:46,443",4.18,268,"As you can see, I am afraid I cannot see you out since I am heavily injured."
1,4,"00:26:54,154","00:26:55,454",1.30,269,What is going on?
1,4,"00:26:56,448","00:26:57,658",1.21,270,All right.
1,4,"00:26:57,741","00:26:59,581",1.84,271,I will keep my promise and let you have it.
1,4,"00:27:00,285","00:27:03,910",3.62,272,"However, I must punish her."
1,4,"00:27:09,127","00:27:11,707",2.58,273,I will not forgive her for tainting my clothes.
1,4,"00:28:04,599","00:28:07,139",2.54,274,I unsheathed this sword…
1,4,"00:28:21,199","00:28:22,909",1.71,275,Jang Uk!
1,4,"00:28:22,992","00:28:27,412",4.42,276,"I thought you did not know how to use spells, but you have been deceiving us all."
1,4,"00:28:27,997","00:28:28,827",0.83,277,That is not…
1,4,"00:28:29,457","00:28:31,537",2.08,278,What?
1,4,"00:28:38,633","00:28:40,053",1.42,279,You!
1,4,"00:28:40,135","00:28:42,425",2.29,280,How dare you point the sword at the Crown Prince?
1,4,"00:28:42,512","00:28:44,682",2.17,281,"No, it was not me."
1,4,"00:28:42,512","00:28:44,682",2.17,282,Uk! Put that down!
1,4,"00:28:45,682","00:28:47,892",2.21,283,Put it down right now!
1,4,"00:28:45,682","00:28:47,892",2.21,284,I want to!
1,4,"00:28:48,476","00:28:49,476",1.00,285,But I cannot!
1,4,"00:29:12,876","00:29:13,996",1.12,286,Stop it this instant!
1,4,"00:29:15,503","00:29:17,173",1.67,287,I have no control!
1,4,"00:29:29,642","00:29:30,642",1.00,288,Jang Uk.
1,4,"00:29:31,644","00:29:32,904",1.26,289,Die!
1,4,"00:29:42,781","00:29:43,821",1.04,290,Please stop.
1,4,"00:29:52,207","00:29:54,287",2.08,291,Stop it.
1,4,"00:29:52,207","00:29:54,287",2.08,292,This is weird. I cannot control my arm.
1,4,"00:29:54,375","00:29:55,705",1.33,293,What?
1,4,"00:29:57,128","00:29:59,128",2.00,294,I did not mean to do that…
1,4,"00:29:59,631","00:30:02,011",2.38,295,Goodness! Young Master!
1,4,"00:30:03,259","00:30:04,549",1.29,296,"Oh, dear!"
1,4,"00:30:09,015","00:30:10,015",1.00,297,It is a binding bracelet.
1,4,"00:30:10,099","00:30:12,769",2.67,298,Its weight will keep your arm under control.
1,4,"00:30:19,150","00:30:22,820",3.67,299,His energy overflowed into one arm and made it uncontrollable.
1,4,"00:30:24,447","00:30:25,617",1.17,300,Unbind him!
1,4,"00:30:28,159","00:30:29,199",1.04,301,Jang Uk.
1,4,"00:30:30,286","00:30:31,406",1.12,302,Grab your sword.
1,4,"00:30:33,623","00:30:34,583",0.96,303,Your Royal Highness.
1,4,"00:30:34,666","00:30:36,666",2.00,304,He is no match for you.
1,4,"00:30:36,751","00:30:38,341",1.59,305,Did you not just witness it all?
1,4,"00:30:38,419","00:30:40,959",2.54,306,He unsheathed his father's sword and pointed it at me.
1,4,"00:30:41,047","00:30:43,587",2.54,307,He just failed to control his energy.
1,4,"00:30:43,675","00:30:46,175",2.50,308,"As you can see, he even hit me."
1,4,"00:30:43,675","00:30:46,175",2.50,309,Shut it!
1,4,"00:30:48,179","00:30:50,769",2.59,310,"Your Royal Highness, you wielded your sword at him first."
1,4,"00:30:51,349","00:30:53,389",2.04,311,The sword you swung in anger broke.
1,4,"00:30:53,476","00:30:55,896",2.42,312,You should abide by the mages' customs and return home.
1,4,"00:30:59,023","00:31:01,993",2.97,313,How dare you stand against the Crown Prince?
1,4,"00:31:04,404","00:31:08,034",3.63,314,"Jang, Jin, Seo, and Park."
1,4,"00:31:04,404","00:31:08,034",3.63,315,All four of you are before me.
1,4,"00:31:08,950","00:31:11,580",2.63,316,I refuse to go home defeated.
1,4,"00:31:11,661","00:31:12,831",1.17,317,What will you do?
1,4,"00:31:14,080","00:31:16,830",2.75,318,Join hands and come at me.
1,4,"00:31:24,632","00:31:26,512",1.88,319,This is not looking good.
1,4,"00:31:26,593","00:31:29,603",3.01,320,It will look like our families are up against the royalty.
1,4,"00:31:29,679","00:31:31,599",1.92,321,This is getting pretty serious.
1,4,"00:31:31,681","00:31:33,271",1.59,322,Cho-yeon provoked him.
1,4,"00:31:33,349","00:31:35,019",1.67,323,What did I do?
1,4,"00:31:35,560","00:31:38,400",2.84,324,Then let us just hand Uk over.
1,4,"00:31:38,479","00:31:39,559",1.08,325,Your Royal Highness.
1,4,"00:31:40,273","00:31:42,693",2.42,326,They are the four heirs of Daeho.
1,4,"00:31:43,318","00:31:46,399",3.08,327,The King will be furious if he hears of this fight.
1,4,"00:31:47,906","00:31:50,236",2.33,328,Then what? Should I just leave?
1,4,"00:31:51,451","00:31:53,541",2.09,329,You should have stopped me before I started.
1,4,"00:32:07,675","00:32:08,635",0.96,330,"Mu-deok, you…"
1,4,"00:32:17,101","00:32:18,771",1.67,331,"I am terribly sorry, Your Royal Highness."
1,4,"00:32:20,146","00:32:24,482",4.34,332,How dare a lowly brat like me splash filthy chamber pot water on your precious clothes?
1,4,"00:32:29,656","00:32:31,946",2.29,333,I am sorry. I truly am.
1,4,"00:32:32,033","00:32:33,163",1.13,334,Go away.
1,4,"00:32:33,242","00:32:35,542",2.30,335,Get lost. You reek. Go.
1,4,"00:32:36,579","00:32:38,919",2.34,336,Please forgive us.
1,4,"00:32:42,752","00:32:47,552",4.80,337,"As a token of my apology, I will drink the rest of this."
1,4,"00:32:48,466","00:32:50,716",2.25,338,So please forgive us.
1,4,"00:33:00,687","00:33:01,647",0.96,339,Mu-deok!
1,4,"00:33:03,982","00:33:06,112",2.13,340,Why on earth would you drink that?
1,4,"00:33:08,861","00:33:09,821",0.96,341,Young Master!
1,4,"00:33:13,074","00:33:14,624",1.55,342,I should be the one drinking it.
1,4,"00:33:16,494","00:33:17,834",1.34,343,What?
1,4,"00:33:19,622","00:33:21,212",1.59,344,That is not true.
1,4,"00:33:21,290","00:33:23,130",1.84,345,Why would you drink this?
1,4,"00:33:23,209","00:33:25,709",2.50,346,"I am the cause of all this, so I should."
1,4,"00:33:25,795","00:33:28,625",2.83,347,You got it all wrong.
1,4,"00:33:25,795","00:33:28,625",2.83,348,His Royal Highness is upset at me.
1,4,"00:33:28,715","00:33:30,755",2.04,349,So I ought to drink it.
1,4,"00:33:34,387","00:33:36,387",2.00,350,There is quite a lot.
1,4,"00:33:37,223","00:33:39,893",2.67,351,Just give it to me. I will drink it.
1,4,"00:33:39,976","00:33:41,096",1.12,352,Then should we share it?
1,4,"00:33:42,437","00:33:44,647",2.21,353,Why would we share drinking this filthy water?
1,4,"00:33:44,731","00:33:46,071",1.34,354,What?
1,4,"00:33:46,149","00:33:47,229",1.08,355,You can have it all.
1,4,"00:33:49,360","00:33:51,530",2.17,356,Then I will drink some and hand it to you.
1,4,"00:33:51,612","00:33:54,322",2.71,357,Help me hold it up since I cannot use my right arm.
1,4,"00:33:58,327","00:33:59,157",0.83,358,Young Master!
1,4,"00:34:03,833","00:34:05,253",1.42,359,I will drink…
1,4,"00:34:06,502","00:34:07,462",0.96,360,I will drink it.
1,4,"00:34:08,629","00:34:09,589",0.96,361,Forget it.
1,4,"00:34:09,672","00:34:11,552",1.88,362,Why would you drink this?
1,4,"00:34:11,632","00:34:12,762",1.13,363,Just go.
1,4,"00:34:12,842","00:34:15,092",2.25,364,Exactly how much is there?
1,4,"00:34:15,178","00:34:16,798",1.62,365,Do you want me to help out too?
1,4,"00:34:17,430","00:34:19,720",2.29,366,Really?
1,4,"00:34:17,430","00:34:19,720",2.29,367,Give it to me.
1,4,"00:34:23,394","00:34:24,484",1.09,368,It really is chamber pot water.
1,4,"00:34:27,857","00:34:29,067",1.21,369,Your Royal Highness.
1,4,"00:34:29,150","00:34:31,150",2.00,370,How could we possibly dare to challenge you?
1,4,"00:34:31,861","00:34:35,622",3.76,371,Must you let them drink that filthy water solely as an apology?
1,4,"00:34:38,993","00:34:40,373",1.38,372,Damn it.
1,4,"00:34:41,496","00:34:44,706",3.21,373,Forget it. You are making me retch.
1,4,"00:34:47,168","00:34:48,338",1.17,374,Let us go.
1,4,"00:34:50,088","00:34:53,468",3.38,375,His Royal Highness is leaving!
1,4,"00:34:50,088","00:34:53,468",3.38,376,Bow before him!
1,4,"00:34:59,180","00:35:01,640",2.46,377,"By the way, why did he come here?"
1,4,"00:35:02,266","00:35:04,226",1.96,378,He came for Naksu's sword.
1,4,"00:35:04,936","00:35:06,846",1.91,379,Then he suddenly picked a fight.
1,4,"00:35:07,522","00:35:10,362",2.84,380,He may have left for today.
1,4,"00:35:07,522","00:35:12,528",5.01,381,"But given his temper, he will retaliate for sure."
1,4,"00:35:16,030","00:35:18,370",2.34,382,Are you all right?
1,4,"00:35:16,030","00:35:18,370",2.34,383,He hit me so many times.
1,4,"00:35:18,449","00:35:20,989",2.54,384,Goodness.
1,4,"00:35:18,449","00:35:20,989",2.54,385,You hit me pretty hard.
1,4,"00:35:23,454","00:35:25,164",1.71,386,Are you all right?
1,4,"00:35:23,454","00:35:25,164",1.71,387,"Yes, I think so."
1,4,"00:35:25,248","00:35:26,498",1.25,388,It hurts.
1,4,"00:35:25,248","00:35:26,498",1.25,389,Does it?
1,4,"00:35:26,582","00:35:27,922",1.34,390,Are you all right?
1,4,"00:35:26,582","00:35:27,922",1.34,391,It hurts.
1,4,"00:35:28,000","00:35:30,590",2.59,392,It hurts.
1,4,"00:35:28,000","00:35:30,590",2.59,393,Do not touch him!
1,4,"00:35:33,548","00:35:36,378",2.83,394,Your Royal Highness!
1,4,"00:35:40,346","00:35:41,636",1.29,395,What is that?
1,4,"00:35:42,515","00:35:45,515",3.00,396,"You came here for Naksu's sword, so here it is."
1,4,"00:35:47,395","00:35:48,475",1.08,397,That is right.
1,4,"00:35:49,313","00:35:50,863",1.55,398,I had come here to retrieve that.
1,4,"00:35:50,940","00:35:54,780",3.84,399,I brought it to you so you will not have to come here again.
1,4,"00:35:54,861","00:35:56,241",1.38,400,Please take it.
1,4,"00:35:56,988","00:36:00,278",3.29,401,Are you telling me to take what I came here for and never return?
1,4,"00:36:01,534","00:36:05,584",4.05,402,You are truly intelligent and strong.
1,4,"00:36:05,663","00:36:07,873",2.21,403,Are you teasing me since I lost?
1,4,"00:36:07,957","00:36:10,787",2.83,404,Lost? You got what you came here for.
1,4,"00:36:10,877","00:36:12,877",2.00,405,And he lost it.
1,4,"00:36:12,962","00:36:15,972",3.01,406,You are the winner here.
1,4,"00:36:18,467","00:36:22,047",3.58,407,"She is right, Your Royal Highness."
1,4,"00:36:18,467","00:36:22,047",3.58,408,You won.
1,4,"00:36:22,889","00:36:25,099",2.21,409,"Congratulations, Your Royal Highness."
1,4,"00:36:27,185","00:36:28,475",1.29,410,Let us say that is the case.
1,4,"00:36:32,440","00:36:34,610",2.17,411,You are truly generous as well.
1,4,"00:36:34,692","00:36:37,652",2.96,412,There is no other man who is as noble as you.
1,4,"00:36:42,200","00:36:43,370",1.17,413,What is your name?
1,4,"00:36:45,494","00:36:47,124",1.63,414,"It is Mu-deok, Your Royal Highness."
1,4,"00:36:48,289","00:36:49,289",1.00,415,Mu-deok.
1,4,"00:36:49,790","00:36:53,339",3.55,416,"Since you threw filthy water at me, I will call you Filthy Mu-deok from now on."
1,4,"00:36:54,003","00:36:57,973",3.97,417,"Just like your name, you reek of filth right now."
1,4,"00:37:04,597","00:37:06,347",1.75,418,You even gave me a name.
1,4,"00:37:06,432","00:37:09,892",3.46,419,I am truly grateful for your kindness.
1,4,"00:37:14,315","00:37:15,685",1.37,420,"Goodbye, Your Royal Highness."
1,4,"00:37:17,777","00:37:18,737",0.96,421,Let us go.
1,4,"00:37:27,828","00:37:31,328",3.50,422,My pupil is still too weak to fight against you.
1,4,"00:37:31,415","00:37:35,085",3.67,423,"Until he becomes stronger, he should not get on your bad side."
1,4,"00:37:42,218","00:37:46,466",4.25,424,You do not hesitate to fall in love or brown-nose others for your young master's sake.
1,4,"00:37:46,555","00:37:49,135",2.58,425,"I could not fight him myself, so I splashed that on him."
1,4,"00:37:51,143","00:37:54,023",2.88,426,I reek of filth. You should avoid me.
1,4,"00:38:00,111","00:38:00,951",0.84,427,Wipe yourself.
1,4,"00:38:04,573","00:38:07,293",2.72,428,How dare I dirty the man I am in love with?
1,4,"00:38:08,286","00:38:09,536",1.25,429,"No, thank you."
1,4,"00:38:45,489","00:38:47,529",2.04,430,I sure have become Filthy Mu-deok.
1,4,"00:38:53,497","00:38:56,377",2.88,431,You should wash up since you probably reek as well.
1,4,"00:39:13,434","00:39:16,524",3.09,432,"Master, I finally did it."
1,4,"00:39:42,838","00:39:46,928",4.09,433,Gwigu was stolen from Jinyowon.
1,4,"00:39:48,052","00:39:51,812",3.76,434,Only those from the Jin family can open that door.
1,4,"00:39:52,515","00:39:55,765",3.25,435,They must have summoned it out of there.
1,4,"00:39:57,478","00:39:58,898",1.42,436,A burglary in Jinyowon?
1,4,"00:39:58,979","00:40:02,149",3.17,437,You were heartbroken for years after losing your eldest daughter.
1,4,"00:40:02,233","00:40:05,613",3.38,438,You must have become weaker over the years.
1,4,"00:40:06,737","00:40:08,947",2.21,439,What an impudent brat.
1,4,"00:40:09,532","00:40:12,992",3.46,440,"You may be an illegitimate son, but you are still part of the Jin family."
1,4,"00:40:13,077","00:40:15,157",2.08,441,How dare you bad-mouth your half-sister?
1,4,"00:40:15,246","00:40:16,366",1.12,442,How dare you?
1,4,"00:40:16,455","00:40:17,745",1.29,443,I am the Assistant Gwanju.
1,4,"00:40:17,832","00:40:20,462",2.63,444,I would appreciate it if you showed more respect.
1,4,"00:40:28,384","00:40:31,684",3.30,445,"My lord, please come outside."
1,4,"00:40:28,384","00:40:31,684",3.30,446,Jang Uk is here.
1,4,"00:40:53,159","00:40:55,119",1.96,447,Did I not forbid him from entering here?
1,4,"00:40:55,202","00:40:58,752",3.55,448,So why did you bring him with you?
1,4,"00:40:59,665","00:41:01,455",1.79,449,There is something you should see.
1,4,"00:41:08,674","00:41:10,554",1.88,450,This is my father's sword.
1,4,"00:41:11,343","00:41:14,723",3.38,451,"When I was young, you said you would accept me if I unsheathed this."
1,4,"00:41:15,389","00:41:16,349",0.96,452,Do you remember?
1,4,"00:41:57,306","00:42:00,016",2.71,453,I thought he had just opened his gate of energy.
1,4,"00:42:00,726","00:42:03,726",3.00,454,I see he has absorbed my torrent of energy.
1,4,"00:42:04,396","00:42:06,476",2.08,455,"Like father, like son."
1,4,"00:42:06,565","00:42:08,685",2.12,456,He mastered Ryusu in the blink of an eye.
1,4,"00:42:09,401","00:42:14,409",5.01,457,"Please take me under your wing, my lord."
1,4,"00:42:19,245","00:42:20,865",1.62,458,What is that around your arm?
1,4,"00:42:21,455","00:42:23,705",2.25,459,His energy is focused on his right arm.
1,4,"00:42:23,791","00:42:27,127",3.34,460,"He could not control it yet, so it has been tied down by the binding bracelet."
1,4,"00:42:38,722","00:42:40,682",1.96,461,Take it off.
1,4,"00:42:41,600","00:42:44,140",2.54,462,"If we do, his arm will get out of control."
1,4,"00:42:44,228","00:42:47,058",2.83,463,He should unbind it after receiving more training.
1,4,"00:42:48,107","00:42:49,227",1.12,464,Do it.
1,4,"00:43:15,634","00:43:19,054",3.42,465,Let me see you hold your sword.
1,4,"00:43:50,544","00:43:52,464",1.92,466,Bind his arm again.
1,4,"00:44:05,601","00:44:07,901",2.30,467,"Are you all right, my lord?"
1,4,"00:44:08,937","00:44:14,566",5.63,468,What is the point of unsheathing the sword when you cannot even hold it?
1,4,"00:44:20,741","00:44:22,661",1.92,469,He is just not able to control it for now.
1,4,"00:44:22,743","00:44:24,913",2.17,470,But his power is incredible.
1,4,"00:44:24,995","00:44:26,495",1.50,471,He even beat the Crown Prince with that.
1,4,"00:44:27,539","00:44:29,919",2.38,472,He broke His Royal Highness' sword.
1,4,"00:44:30,501","00:44:34,168",3.67,473,"Despite having mastered Ryusu long ago, he was defeated by Uk."
1,4,"00:44:35,714","00:44:37,934",2.22,474,"Cho-yeon, stop intervening."
1,4,"00:44:39,093","00:44:40,473",1.38,475,"Yes, Mother."
1,4,"00:44:41,345","00:44:46,095",4.75,476,"Uk, did you really fight the Crown Prince?"
1,4,"00:44:46,684","00:44:48,444",1.76,477,He did not start it first.
1,4,"00:44:48,519","00:44:50,399",1.88,478,Did you fight him?
1,4,"00:44:52,439","00:44:53,519",1.08,479,I did.
1,4,"00:44:54,817","00:44:57,527",2.71,480,His Royal Highness wanted to take the Gwanju's sword.
1,4,"00:44:57,611","00:44:59,491",1.88,481,"It was a bet, my lord."
1,4,"00:45:00,197","00:45:02,157",1.96,482,Even the Crown Prince forgave him.
1,4,"00:45:03,367","00:45:07,657",4.29,483,"Despite his sword having broken, Uk still threatened him with that sword!"
1,4,"00:45:07,746","00:45:10,576",2.83,484,He put the Crown Prince's life in danger.
1,4,"00:45:10,666","00:45:11,666",1.00,485,We were there too.
1,4,"00:45:12,793","00:45:13,883",1.09,486,We stopped him beforehand.
1,4,"00:45:13,961","00:45:18,258",4.30,487,That means the four of you watched as His Royal Highness was ridiculed.
1,4,"00:45:20,717","00:45:23,717",3.00,488,This is an insult to the royal family!
1,4,"00:45:26,723","00:45:28,523",1.80,489,Lock him up.
1,4,"00:45:31,395","00:45:33,555",2.16,490,He is uncontrollable and dangerous.
1,4,"00:45:33,647","00:45:34,767",1.12,491,"Yes, my lord."
1,4,"00:45:54,209","00:46:00,173",5.96,492,"As soon as his gate of energy was opened, Jang Uk immediately wielded his sword at the Crown Prince."
1,4,"00:46:03,177","00:46:06,007",2.83,493,Cheonbugwan will not let this slide.
1,4,"00:47:06,073","00:47:08,873",2.80,494,Have you still not received treatment?
1,4,"00:47:06,073","00:47:08,873",2.80,495,You bled a lot.
1,4,"00:47:11,245","00:47:13,615",2.37,496,How is your arm?
1,4,"00:47:17,334","00:47:19,554",2.22,497,The binding bracelet hinders its movement.
1,4,"00:47:20,379","00:47:21,629",1.25,498,But I am fine.
1,4,"00:47:23,382","00:47:28,135",4.75,499,You managed to turn Master Heo's torrent of energy into yours in a short period of time.
1,4,"00:47:29,304","00:47:30,514",1.21,500,I am truly impressed.
1,4,"00:47:33,141","00:47:35,061",1.92,501,It felt like my body was on fire.
1,4,"00:47:35,644","00:47:38,114",2.47,502,Then it felt like I was covered in ice.
1,4,"00:47:39,856","00:47:42,106",2.25,503,What about the wounds from the flogging?
1,4,"00:47:42,192","00:47:43,532",1.34,504,Are you still in pain?
1,4,"00:47:46,363","00:47:50,413",4.05,505,It seems like the flogging helped surge the energy.
1,4,"00:47:52,369","00:47:54,499",2.13,506,The Crown Prince had landed many hits.
1,4,"00:47:56,456","00:47:59,586",3.13,507,Then I felt a surge within me.
1,4,"00:47:59,668","00:48:01,038",1.37,508,That is when I unsheathed it.
1,4,"00:48:03,422","00:48:04,422",1.00,509,Right.
1,4,"00:48:05,173","00:48:09,603",4.43,510,You were always a quick learner compared to others.
1,4,"00:48:10,762","00:48:14,602",3.84,511,You even learned to walk and run sooner than Dang-gu did.
1,4,"00:48:15,392","00:48:17,692",2.30,512,You could also talk before he could.
1,4,"00:48:18,854","00:48:20,274",1.42,513,I still remember that.
1,4,"00:48:21,064","00:48:28,663",7.60,514,"When I did not know what it meant to have a blocked gate of energy, I thought I would become the most powerful person."
1,4,"00:48:34,036","00:48:35,286",1.25,515,Uk.
1,4,"00:48:36,747","00:48:40,787",4.04,516,You are intelligent and pick up things quickly.
1,4,"00:48:43,295","00:48:47,585",4.29,517,How about you join our trade and learn how to do business?
1,4,"00:48:48,175","00:48:52,845",4.67,518,Or Master Heo can take you under his wing and teach you the art of medicine.
1,4,"00:48:57,643","00:48:58,693",1.05,519,"No, my lord."
1,4,"00:49:01,730","00:49:04,980",3.25,520,I am going to train in Jeongjingak and become a mage.
1,4,"00:49:05,651","00:49:06,741",1.09,521,Why?
1,4,"00:49:07,694","00:49:10,414",2.72,522,Because that is what your father did?
1,4,"00:49:12,324","00:49:15,494",3.17,523,Do you desire to become the next Gwanju of Cheonbugwan?
1,4,"00:49:16,161","00:49:18,911",2.75,524,"Yes, my lord. And I will be."
1,4,"00:49:19,998","00:49:24,748",4.75,525,I will take his place and prove it to all those scumbags who denied that I was his son.
1,4,"00:49:26,338","00:49:28,258",1.92,526,I will make them speechless.
1,4,"00:49:26,338","00:49:34,300",7.96,527,You… are not his son.
1,4,"00:49:37,641","00:49:42,853",5.21,528,You are the result of your mother's love affair.
1,4,"00:49:44,940","00:49:48,320",3.38,529,"To show our respect to your late mother, we let you into the Jang family."
1,4,"00:49:48,402","00:49:51,202",2.80,530,But we cannot allow you to lead Cheonbugwan after your father.
1,4,"00:49:51,279","00:49:58,412",7.13,531,So stop dreaming of becoming… like your father.
1,4,"00:49:59,871","00:50:06,457",6.59,532,Just stay a clueless Young Master of the Jang family.
1,4,"00:50:08,338","00:50:13,296",4.96,533,"If you do, we will continue to take care of you."
1,4,"00:50:20,976","00:50:22,056",1.08,534,Then…
1,4,"00:50:25,230","00:50:26,860",1.63,535,Then who is my real father?
1,4,"00:50:29,609","00:50:37,908",8.30,536,How would anyone know whom your late mother… had an affair with?
1,4,"00:51:12,402","00:51:16,162",3.76,537,Uk probably has a lot on his mind.
1,4,"00:51:12,402","00:51:16,162",3.76,538,You should let him be.
1,4,"00:51:22,871","00:51:24,751",1.88,539,Make sure he finishes his food.
1,4,"00:51:34,549","00:51:37,429",2.88,540,Maidservant Kim told me to make sure you finished your meal.
1,4,"00:51:41,097","00:51:42,467",1.37,541,Did he scold you again?
1,4,"00:51:44,810","00:51:47,350",2.54,542,I thought you were used to being scolded…
1,4,"00:51:59,699","00:52:00,869",1.17,543,It was not me.
1,4,"00:52:00,951","00:52:04,251",3.30,544,I do not think they have fixed the door since that incident.
1,4,"00:52:06,957","00:52:07,867",0.91,545,Do not move.
1,4,"00:52:09,668","00:52:10,998",1.33,546,Just stay there.
1,4,"00:52:14,756","00:52:16,796",2.04,547,It might all crumble down.
1,4,"00:52:19,219","00:52:20,799",1.58,548,So just stay there.
1,4,"00:52:33,692","00:52:36,702",3.01,549,Why did you not dodge his blade?
1,4,"00:52:37,737","00:52:41,741",4.00,550,Was it because you needed another reason to kick him out?
1,4,"00:52:42,784","00:52:44,794",2.01,551,I deserve it.
1,4,"00:52:44,870","00:52:48,460",3.59,552,"After all, I broke his heart."
1,4,"00:52:50,041","00:52:54,341",4.30,553,Breaking his heart must be more painful than getting stabbed.
1,4,"00:52:56,172","00:52:57,302",1.13,554,Maidservant Kim.
1,4,"00:52:58,133","00:53:03,143",5.01,555,"You said there were rumors about how I was Uk's father, right?"
1,4,"00:53:03,680","00:53:10,346",6.67,556,What if I just said that I was indeed his father?
1,4,"00:53:14,149","00:53:16,359",2.21,557,I will step down from my position.
1,4,"00:53:17,986","00:53:23,661",5.68,558,Then I will have my own little business and do trading with Uk.
1,4,"00:53:24,242","00:53:27,002",2.76,559,Songrim needs its leader.
1,4,"00:53:29,039","00:53:33,539",4.50,560,Then how about I say that I am his mother?
1,4,"00:53:34,336","00:53:39,089",4.75,561,I think it would be better if Uk and I went to the hometown where Lady Do-hwa and I grew up.
1,4,"00:53:41,593","00:53:44,303",2.71,562,That cannot happen.
1,4,"00:53:45,931","00:53:53,861",7.93,563,Uk takes after Do-hwa. That is why he is so good-looking.
1,4,"00:53:54,940","00:54:00,033",5.09,564,Who would believe you… if you said you were his mother?
1,4,"00:54:02,238","00:54:03,238",1.00,565,Hold on.
1,4,"00:54:04,032","00:54:07,872",3.84,566,Are you saying he should be ugly if I was his mother?
1,4,"00:54:08,870","00:54:11,250",2.38,567,"In that case, you cannot be his father either."
1,4,"00:54:11,331","00:54:12,831",1.50,568,"Of course, I can."
1,4,"00:54:13,583","00:54:22,718",9.13,569,Jang Gang and I have always been neck and neck… when it came to our looks.
1,4,"00:54:25,845","00:54:26,965",1.12,570,"No, you lost."
1,4,"00:54:27,555","00:54:29,095",1.54,571,You cannot hold a candle to him.
1,4,"00:54:29,182","00:54:33,312",4.13,572,Do-hwa said she loved everything about you except for your looks.
1,4,"00:54:33,395","00:54:35,555",2.16,573,Do not put words in her mouth!
1,4,"00:54:36,773","00:54:38,613",1.84,574,You did not even flinch when you got stabbed.
1,4,"00:54:38,692","00:54:40,992",2.30,575,But I guess hearing that you are ugly is quite painful.
1,4,"00:54:41,069","00:54:45,873",4.80,576,The pain runs deep.
1,4,"00:54:45,949","00:54:47,619",1.67,577,Does your wound hurt?
1,4,"00:54:47,701","00:54:50,251",2.55,578,Stay still.
1,4,"00:54:47,701","00:54:50,251",2.55,579,You will break open the wound again.
1,4,"00:54:52,288","00:55:04,433",12.14,580,We share… the same pain of not having our feelings reciprocated by the ones we loved.
1,4,"00:55:04,926","00:55:09,005",4.08,581,So let us not hurt each other.
1,4,"00:55:10,807","00:55:14,387",3.58,582,I admit that I did not mean what I said.
1,4,"00:55:14,477","00:55:18,981",4.50,583,You are… good…
1,4,"00:55:22,193","00:55:23,283",1.09,584,Good…
1,4,"00:55:24,529","00:55:26,029",1.50,585,Good-looking.
1,4,"00:55:28,408","00:55:34,957",6.55,586,You are also indeed good…
1,4,"00:55:36,082","00:55:39,292",3.21,587,Good-looking.
1,4,"00:55:47,010","00:55:49,970",2.96,588,Let me tend to your wound.
1,4,"00:55:50,638","00:55:51,848",1.21,589,It hurts.
1,4,"00:55:52,974","00:55:54,234",1.26,590,Goodness.
1,4,"00:55:55,268","00:55:56,938",1.67,591,A bit below.
1,4,"00:55:57,020","00:55:58,560",1.54,592,That is right.
1,4,"00:55:58,646","00:56:01,316",2.67,593,Gosh.
1,4,"00:55:58,646","00:56:01,316",2.67,594,Goodness.
1,4,"00:56:10,116","00:56:13,618",3.50,595,Jang Uk seems to be the owner of the Spirit Plaque from Chwiseonru.
1,4,"00:56:14,913","00:56:15,913",1.00,596,Jang Uk?
1,4,"00:56:15,997","00:56:18,787",2.79,597,He was flogged recently after losing Songrim's Spirit Plaque.
1,4,"00:56:18,875","00:56:22,625",3.75,598,And I heard his maid frequented this place.
1,4,"00:56:25,673","00:56:28,473",2.80,599,That girl from Songrim is his maid.
1,4,"00:56:29,677","00:56:32,847",3.17,600,And she was at the inn that day.
1,4,"00:56:35,225","00:56:38,477",3.25,601,Could she be Naksu?
1,4,"00:56:42,524","00:56:45,694",3.17,602,Are we still far away from Cheonbugwan?
1,4,"00:56:49,114","00:56:52,454",3.34,603,I think I will be petrified at this rate.
1,4,"00:56:53,326","00:56:55,076",1.75,604,We will hurry. Please stay strong.
1,4,"00:56:55,620","00:56:57,540",1.92,605,You must not run wild right now.
1,4,"00:56:58,414","00:57:01,004",2.59,606,"My lord, are you all right?"
1,4,"00:57:28,987","00:57:31,607",2.62,607,Let us just go back.
1,4,"00:57:52,302","00:57:59,393",7.09,608,This arm of yours reached Ryusu in that short period of time.
1,4,"00:58:00,768","00:58:03,978",3.21,609,You sure are as bright as your father.
1,4,"00:58:06,858","00:58:12,321",5.46,610,Jin Mu from Cheonbugwan only picked a fight because he realized he will never become the next Gwanju.
1,4,"00:58:12,405","00:58:17,697",5.29,611,"He has realized that you, the eldest son of the Jang family, would become the next Gwanju."
1,4,"00:58:26,294","00:58:29,174",2.88,612,My uncle's wound was not that deep.
1,4,"00:58:29,255","00:58:30,715",1.46,613,Do not worry about him.
1,4,"00:58:30,798","00:58:34,258",3.46,614,I will have a word with Jin Mu.
1,4,"00:58:34,344","00:58:35,394",1.05,615,All right?
1,4,"00:58:41,434","00:58:42,944",1.51,616,Take good care of him.
1,4,"00:59:11,381","00:59:13,341",1.96,617,You always put Uk in danger.
1,4,"00:59:15,009","00:59:19,601",4.59,618,You were there when he was poisoned and during the confrontation with the Crown Prince.
1,4,"00:59:21,808","00:59:25,398",3.59,619,So do you want to separate me from him?
1,4,"00:59:25,478","00:59:26,688",1.21,620,I cannot do that.
1,4,"00:59:30,024","00:59:32,244",2.22,621,He got what he wanted every time.
1,4,"00:59:32,860","00:59:34,650",1.79,622,And you risked your life to save him.
1,4,"00:59:41,327","00:59:43,197",1.87,623,This is his father's sword.
1,4,"00:59:43,288","00:59:44,998",1.71,624,Take it with you.
1,4,"01:00:13,443","01:00:15,493",2.05,625,I cannot tolerate this any longer.
1,4,"01:00:15,570","01:00:17,240",1.67,626,How long will this pity party last?
1,4,"01:00:24,203","01:00:25,413",1.21,627,Get up.
1,4,"01:00:37,675","01:00:40,845",3.17,628,"You received a powerful torrent of energy, and it surged within you."
1,4,"01:00:41,596","01:00:45,386",3.79,629,It took you merely ten days when it would take ten years for others.
1,4,"01:00:45,475","01:00:47,475",2.00,630,If you keep training--
1,4,"01:00:45,475","01:00:47,475",2.00,631,Forget it.
1,4,"01:00:47,560","01:00:48,980",1.42,632,I will not do it.
1,4,"01:00:51,981","01:00:53,691",1.71,633,Have Park Jin's few words dispirited you?
1,4,"01:00:54,442","01:00:56,532",2.09,634,So all this was just an act of stupidity.
1,4,"01:00:56,611","01:00:59,491",2.88,635,No wonder you look so hopeless.
1,4,"01:00:56,611","01:00:59,491",2.88,636,You are just too weak!
1,4,"01:00:59,572","01:01:02,372",2.80,637,"Yes, I am."
1,4,"01:00:59,572","01:01:02,372",2.80,638,So I am not going to do anything.
1,4,"01:01:02,450","01:01:03,910",1.46,639,So just be quiet.
1,4,"01:01:05,703","01:01:07,333",1.63,640,Just shut up and do not bother me.
1,4,"01:01:15,171","01:01:17,381",2.21,641,I do not need a pupil who will not do anything.
1,4,"01:01:21,719","01:01:23,299",1.58,642,Then do not be my master.
1,4,"01:01:24,430","01:01:25,930",1.50,643,Just be my maid.
1,4,"01:01:27,016","01:01:28,936",1.92,644,"Annoy me again, and I will sell you off."
1,4,"01:02:08,099","01:02:09,229",1.13,645,Young Master.
1,4,"01:02:11,436","01:02:16,066",4.63,646,My young master is too troubled and will not drink any water.
1,4,"01:02:16,149","01:02:18,109",1.96,647,Can you please help?
1,4,"01:02:18,192","01:02:19,782",1.59,648,What can I do?
1,4,"01:02:20,445","01:02:22,275",1.83,649,It is best that my uncle resolves this.
1,4,"01:02:22,363","01:02:25,623",3.26,650,Master Heo said he would step up.
1,4,"01:02:25,700","01:02:29,410",3.71,651,Please ask him to meet with Jin Mu and put an end to this immediately.
1,4,"01:02:34,167","01:02:41,341",7.17,652,I came here today because I am concerned that you exacerbated a trivial issue.
1,4,"01:02:41,424","01:02:45,804",4.38,653,How could threatening the Crown Prince be deemed trivial?
1,4,"01:02:48,347","01:02:51,517",3.17,654,That is why our leader locked him away.
1,4,"01:02:52,143","01:02:54,903",2.76,655,Songrim will give him the punishment he deserves.
1,4,"01:02:54,979","01:02:57,819",2.84,656,Songrim cannot punish him when this concerns the royal family.
1,4,"01:02:58,524","01:03:02,284",3.76,657,"Since Cheonbugwan is in charge, we will punish him here."
1,4,"01:03:03,029","01:03:05,159",2.13,658,What will you do with him?
1,4,"01:03:05,239","01:03:09,079",3.84,659,"Since he threatened the Crown Prince, he deserves to be beheaded."
1,4,"01:03:11,287","01:03:15,167",3.88,660,"However, we cannot kill the Gwanju's one and only son."
1,4,"01:03:15,833","01:03:19,673",3.84,661,So we ought to cut off the arm that threatened the Crown Prince.
1,4,"01:03:20,338","01:03:22,258",1.92,662,Cut off his arm?
1,4,"01:03:22,340","01:03:29,012",6.67,663,It must have hurt your pride that your pupil could not put up a fight against Uk whose gate of energy had only been open for ten days.
1,4,"01:03:29,096","01:03:31,886",2.79,664,"You fool, I was generous enough to save you two's faces."
1,4,"01:03:31,974","01:03:34,234",2.26,665,So I was going to be nice about this.
1,4,"01:03:34,310","01:03:35,940",1.63,666,But you have gone insane.
1,4,"01:03:36,020","01:03:39,770",3.75,667,Let Cheonbugwan determine if it is me who is crazy or Jang Uk.
1,4,"01:03:39,857","01:03:42,897",3.04,668,You little--
1,4,"01:03:39,857","01:03:42,897",3.04,669,"Master, please."
1,4,"01:03:44,654","01:03:47,324",2.67,670,Their fight was consensual.
1,4,"01:03:47,907","01:03:50,277",2.37,671,Uk's maid witnessed it all from the beginning.
1,4,"01:03:53,246","01:03:55,036",1.79,672,It was a fair fight.
1,4,"01:03:56,249","01:04:00,919",4.67,673,"If you cannot believe us, let them fight again."
1,4,"01:04:05,174","01:04:08,764",3.59,674,Fight again? That is a good idea.
1,4,"01:04:10,263","01:04:18,770",8.51,675,"Since you claim he was not threatening the Crown Prince and that it was a fair fight, how about we have an official duel?"
1,4,"01:04:19,397","01:04:21,687",2.29,676,A duel between the Crown Prince and Uk?
1,4,"01:04:22,275","01:04:25,235",2.96,677,"If you cannot do that, hand Uk over to us."
1,4,"01:04:25,319","01:04:31,241",5.92,678,"But if you accept this, we will not ask anyone to take responsibility even if someone dies."
1,4,"01:04:32,118","01:04:34,498",2.38,679,As per the Daeho mages' customs.
1,4,"01:04:45,423","01:04:48,223",2.80,680,"We had come here to resolve it, but look what we have done."
1,4,"01:04:48,801","01:04:52,971",4.17,681,That sly snake got the better of me.
1,4,"01:04:53,055","01:04:56,055",3.00,682,Uk will die if they have an official duel.
1,4,"01:04:53,055","01:04:56,055",3.00,683,What should we do?
1,4,"01:04:56,142","01:04:57,442",1.30,684,Do not worry.
1,4,"01:04:57,518","01:04:59,848",2.33,685,The Crown Prince will not take up the challenge.
1,4,"01:05:00,938","01:05:06,936",6.00,686,"Ever since Master Seo Gyeong founded Songrim, the royal family and the mages have never dueled before."
1,4,"01:05:07,028","01:05:13,493",6.47,687,Both sides have kept this unspoken rule so they would not waste their energy on each other.
1,4,"01:05:14,076","01:05:18,624",4.55,688,There is no way the Crown Prince would break that and fight Uk.
1,4,"01:05:27,632","01:05:29,342",1.71,689,Please take up the challenge.
1,4,"01:05:30,509","01:05:34,719",4.21,690,I do not see why I need to go against Songrim just because of that fool.
1,4,"01:05:34,805","01:05:38,805",4.00,691,"Thanks to them, they will not be able to point their fingers at us."
1,4,"01:05:38,893","01:05:43,193",4.30,692,Show Songrim exactly how strong you are.
1,4,"01:06:03,334","01:06:05,424",2.09,693,They are royal guards and Cheonbugwan's men.
1,4,"01:06:06,003","01:06:07,173",1.17,694,What is going on?
1,4,"01:06:07,797","01:06:09,797",2.00,695,"Darn it, Master Heo."
1,4,"01:06:10,591","01:06:12,551",1.96,696,He said nothing would happen.
1,4,"01:06:12,635","01:06:14,295",1.66,697,What is all this?
1,4,"01:06:15,179","01:06:16,719",1.54,698,What should we do with Uk?
1,4,"01:06:19,684","01:06:22,564",2.88,699,I do not understand why they are here.
1,4,"01:06:22,645","01:06:26,315",3.67,700,I was going to talk to you about it.
1,4,"01:06:26,399","01:06:28,529",2.13,701,But Jin Mu beat me to it.
1,4,"01:06:29,944","01:06:31,114",1.17,702,Jin Mu?
1,4,"01:06:31,904","01:06:34,244",2.34,703,Did something happen again?
1,4,"01:06:36,158","01:06:37,578",1.42,704,Darn it!
1,4,"01:06:37,660","01:06:42,248",4.59,705,The Crown Prince has challenged Jang Uk to a duel.
1,4,"01:06:44,500","01:06:50,966",6.47,706,The Assistant Gwanju said we should transfer Jang Uk to Cheonbugwan if he refused the challenge.
1,4,"01:06:51,549","01:06:54,469",2.92,707,Jang Uk is already locked up in here.
1,4,"01:06:56,303","01:06:59,813",3.51,708,Transfer to Cheonbugwan?
1,4,"01:06:56,303","01:06:59,813",3.51,709,What is this about?
1,4,"01:06:59,890","01:07:01,600",1.71,710,Please ask Master Heo.
1,4,"01:07:02,393","01:07:05,693",3.30,711,I was told they had already agreed on this.
1,4,"01:07:14,488","01:07:17,448",2.96,712,"Uk, get up. You need to get out of here."
1,4,"01:07:18,200","01:07:19,290",1.09,713,What is it?
1,4,"01:07:19,368","01:07:22,748",3.38,714,There is no time to explain.
1,4,"01:07:19,368","01:07:22,748",3.38,715,"If you do not go, you will lose your arm."
1,4,"01:07:23,664","01:07:25,424",1.76,716,"No, you could even die."
1,4,"01:07:26,000","01:07:27,290",1.29,717,What?
1,4,"01:07:26,000","01:07:27,290",1.29,718,Young Master.
1,4,"01:07:27,877","01:07:29,417",1.54,719,Things have gotten serious.
1,4,"01:07:29,503","01:07:32,013",2.51,720,"Stay here, and you will lose an arm or your life."
1,4,"01:07:33,049","01:07:34,509",1.46,721,Will you still do nothing?
1,4,"01:07:45,853","01:07:50,403",4.55,722,I will go to the royal palace with Jang Uk and meet with the Crown Prince.
1,4,"01:07:50,983","01:07:52,943",1.96,723,Uk will be here soon.
1,4,"01:07:57,531","01:07:58,491",0.96,724,Where is Uk?
1,4,"01:07:58,574","01:08:01,834",3.26,725,He is not in the secret room.
1,4,"01:07:58,574","01:08:01,834",3.26,726,I think he fled.
1,4,"01:08:02,536","01:08:03,536",1.00,727,What?
1,4,"01:08:10,711","01:08:15,215",4.50,728,"When you are caught between a rock and a hard place, fleeing is your best bet."
1,4,"01:08:23,182","01:08:26,102",2.92,729,"He was here all along, and only his maid came and went."
1,4,"01:08:26,685","01:08:28,265",1.58,730,I do not understand how he fled.
1,4,"01:08:30,898","01:08:32,858",1.96,731,Where are Yul and Dang-gu?
1,4,"01:08:41,617","01:08:45,247",3.63,732,Our leader will take care of it.
1,4,"01:08:41,617","01:08:45,247",3.63,733,Lie low until the dust settles.
1,4,"01:08:46,580","01:08:49,330",2.75,734,"Mu-deok, take good care of him."
1,4,"01:08:50,251","01:08:53,251",3.00,735,"By the way, are you sure you do not need us to come?"
1,4,"01:08:53,337","01:08:55,837",2.50,736,"Yes, we are going to my former village."
1,4,"01:08:55,923","01:08:57,883",1.96,737,"Sari Village, was it?"
1,4,"01:08:57,967","01:09:00,797",2.83,738,Stay there. We will come to pick you up soon.
1,4,"01:09:06,892","01:09:09,102",2.21,739,You have put him in danger once again.
1,4,"01:09:12,356","01:09:14,726",2.37,740,And he will get what he wants once more.
1,4,"01:09:42,011","01:09:48,428",6.42,741,The duel will take place in the middle of next month.
1,4,"01:09:51,896","01:09:59,818",7.92,742,"But if he does not show up on that day, please accept that as his defeat."
1,4,"01:09:59,904","01:10:02,364",2.46,743,"That is fleeing, not losing."
1,4,"01:10:04,450","01:10:07,120",2.67,744,I believe a coward like that should be punished.
1,4,"01:10:09,705","01:10:11,325",1.62,745,I agree with him.
1,4,"01:10:11,957","01:10:19,168",7.21,746,"If Jang Uk does not show up, he will be deprived of his right to become the next Gwanju."
1,4,"01:10:27,097","01:10:29,347",2.25,747,"I understand, Your Majesty."
1,4,"01:10:46,951","01:10:49,041",2.09,748,Why bring that when we are fleeing?
1,4,"01:10:50,371","01:10:51,791",1.42,749,Because you need to train.
1,4,"01:10:51,872","01:10:53,082",1.21,750,Train?
1,4,"01:10:53,165","01:10:54,455",1.29,751,Are we going there to train?
1,4,"01:10:56,043","01:10:57,093",1.05,752,Were you behind everything?
1,4,"01:10:57,169","01:10:58,629",1.46,753,I just played a part.
1,4,"01:10:59,129","01:11:01,969",2.84,754,You finally budged when I said you were in danger.
1,4,"01:11:04,051","01:11:05,301",1.25,755,What is wrong?
1,4,"01:11:05,386","01:11:07,466",2.08,756,I do not need a pupil who does not improve.
1,4,"01:11:08,264","01:11:10,854",2.59,757,Just die if you are not going to do anything.
1,4,"01:11:10,933","01:11:15,646",4.71,758,"You have poisoned me again, crazy master."
1,4,"01:11:16,313","01:11:17,363",1.05,759,Jang Uk.
1,4,"01:11:18,148","01:11:21,528",3.38,760,We will go to where I used to train.
1,4,"01:11:18,148","01:11:21,528",3.38,761,Brace yourself.
1,4,"01:11:22,152","01:11:30,288",8.14,762,"There will be no warm baths, cozy beds, or food that is seasoned well to your liking."
1,4,"01:11:32,454","01:11:35,424",2.97,763,Is Sari Village really that scary?
1,4,"01:11:36,250","01:11:38,880",2.63,764,Sari Village was where Mu-deok was from.
1,4,"01:11:38,961","01:11:43,376",4.41,765,Naksu's hometown was Danhyanggok.
1,4,"01:11:45,759","01:11:47,469",1.71,766,That is our destination.
